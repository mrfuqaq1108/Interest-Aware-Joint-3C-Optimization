## sentiment_analysis_DCN
**Solving the request probability problem for each user.**
 
Four common methods for analyzing the text are used and compared:

|  Method  | Pytorch code | Our training model | Our numerical result | training accuracy | validation accuracy | testing accuracy |
|:--------:|:------------:|:------------------:|:--------------------:|:-----------------:|:-------------------:|:----------------:|
| TextCNN  |    CNN.py    |    CNN-model.pt    |    CNN_result.py     |    **94.17%**     |       87.26%        |      85.89%      |
| TextRNN  |    RNN.py    |    RNN-model.pt    |    RNN_result.py     |      86.66%       |       88.79%        |      87.85%      |
| FastText | Fasttext.py  | Fasttext-model.pt  |  Fasttext_result.py  |      86.87%       |       85.66%        |      85.45%      |
|   Bert   |   Bert.py    |   Bert-model.pt    |    Bert_result.py    |      93.07%       |     **91.23%**      |    **91.87%**    |

Hence, we choose **Bert model**  to acquire the usersâ€™ request probability matrix.

Without loss of generality, we choose 10 contents from the Amazon Review Data (2018) dataset. 
We define the "popularity" as the normalized number of comments per content.
For each chosen content, we choose 5 comments.

**prob_acquire.py**: Pytorch code for sentiment analysis from the dataset using Bert model.

**prob_matrix.py**: Numerical result (without normalized).

For our training model, you can download at: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19BlMoVZ8_dLkbxxcrZJdvPTtjBGlwNR6?usp=drive_link

You should download bert-base-uncased yourself, which contains:
- config.json
- pytorch_model.bin
- vocab.txt

You should download glove.6B.zip in the .vector_cache, and imdb dataset in the .data.

**para.py** contains four different distribution.

- **real_prob**: Our Bert model, which is normalized from **prob_matrix.py**.
- **avg_prob**: Uniform distribution.

Through this code, we can obtain a specific bandwidth for each user under the given caching and computing policy.

Through this code, we can obtain a optimal bandwidth distribution under the given caching and computing policy, thus problem (P4) can be solved.

Through this code, we can solve problem (P1) by iterating **Algorithm 1** and **Algorithm 2** alternatively.

**T_E.py**: Since our optimization goal, cost, is depicted as the weighted sum of overall VR delivery delay and energy consumption of local device, 
we can use this code to separately calculate the delay T, energy consumption E, and cost of VR services.
