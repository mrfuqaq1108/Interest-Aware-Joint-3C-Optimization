0,1527665,5,"really happy they got evangelised .. spoiler alert==happy ending liked that..since started bit worrisome... but yeah great stories these missionary movies, really short only half hour but still great"
1,1527665,5,"Having lived in West New Guinea (Papua) during the time period covered in this video, it is realistic, accurate, and conveys well the entrance of light and truth into a culture that was for centuries dead to and alienated from God."
2,1527665,5,Excellent look into contextualizing the Gospel and God's sovereignty over cultural barriers. The book and movie are both captivating. I would definitely recommend to both Christians and non-believers.
3,1527665,5,"More than anything, I've been challenged to find ways to share Christ is a culturally relevant way to those around me.  Peace child is a cherished ""how to"" for me to do that."
4,1527665,4,"This is a great movie for a missionary going into a foreign country, especially one that is not used to foreign presence. But, it was a little on the short side."
5,1527665,5,This movie was in ENGLISH....it was a great summary of the book and the experience of the Richardsons while in New Guinea.
6,1527665,5,"This is a fascinating true story, well acted by many of the actual characters.  Watch this and see just one of countless examples of how faithfully God works out ways for all of mankind to find Him, in every culture."
7,1527665,1,This DVD appears to be in German. It is not in english. I do not speak German.  This needs to be corrected. I want my $1.99 back.
8,1527665,1,This movie is not in English although the title of the movie is as is the book. There is no forewarning anywhere that the movie is not in English. Sounds like it might be Russian?
16,000503860X,4,"It is an excellent experience to watch this DVD after all these years of being an X fan.  It was also very cool to watch this right after a repeated viewing of the DVD X--The Unheard Music (1985).  X still has every ounce of energy and connection it had back then. The only reason I gave it four stars is that John Doe's Bass is overshadowed in the mix.  But having said that, it is a DVD I will treasure for years to come."
17,000503860X,5,"I have a thing against purchasing live DVDs. After all, how many times do you want to sit and watch a gig that you probably weren't even there for in the first place?

But as a dedicated X fan, I couldn't resist checking this out, and I'm thrilled that I did. This is the band in top-notch form.

It's encouraging that people who weren't around L.A. during X's heyday are finally clueing in to how historically important they were, and still are. And this DVD proves they're still as vital and viable as ever.

Do yourself a favor. If you've wandered to this page, there must be a reason. Don't leave without purchasing this DVD. You'll be glad you did, whether you're a diehard fan like myself, or a fan of music who is simply curious. All hail X, and may they continue to make music together for years to come."
18,000503860X,5,"This DVD is unbelievable!  If you are a fan of punk rock, you have to own this DVD.  They play all of their classic songs and the bonus footage is amazing.  I think my favorite part is when they play ""White Girl.""  X has been around for a long time and this is their first live concert DVD, so it makes it even more awesome.  And the liner notes by Flea of The Red Hot Chili Peppers are really cool too.  Definitely buy this DVD!  It's worth every penny!"
19,000503860X,5,"Just brought this DVD home, and it rocks.  Those uninitiated to this great band don't know, but the fans understand, that this is a band that never disappoints live, and I can vouch for this having seen them 25+ times with and without Billy Zoom, solo, and in their Knitters incarnation.  The cool thing about this DVD is that it does not feel nostalgic - unlike the recent Blasters DVD (also by the good folks at Shout!).  The Blasters were and are a fine band, but one look at the audience on that DVD shows that the thrill is, if not gone, definitely waning.  No so with X.  Fans are still passionate, the playing and singing are still passionate, like the band still totally believes in what they are doing, and it shows.  So, fans will love it, but can this win over some new fans?  That's the question.  If you love the band, this DVD is a must buy.  For those of you with tangential interest, or who love other great bands like The Ramones, The Clash etc., or all of you on the east coast not too familiar with the band, take the plunge.  This DVD rocks.  Dare I ask....rock and roll hall of fame anyone????"
20,000503860X,5,"This is exactly how a concert DVD should be done. Tons of cudos to the editors and director of ""X Live in Los Angeles"". Thank you for just showing this amazing live performace, of one of Los Angeles greatests bands. Not .5 seconds rapid fire editing that would make someone sick to their stomach, just simple edits that emphises the music. When Billy Zoom does a solo the camera is actually on......Billy Zoom. Now to the performance. Basically, X still has it, in spades. The song selection is good, John Doe sounds as great as ever and the band is smoking.

I have seen X do faster paced sets in my day but this one is very good. Although the DVD is excellent, the best way to experience this show is to get as many people as you can into your living room, turn the heater onto around 100 degrees and blast this sucker. Now we're living."
21,000503860X,5,"I have seen X live many times, both in the early days and their more recent reunion shows. Trust me when I say this: they never disappoint as a live band! This DVD document of a show on their home turf of LA is a dream come true. Can't wait."
22,000503860X,5,"I was so excited for this!  Finally, a live concert video from X!  I've seen them twice, both times with Tony G. on guitar (he was superb by the way).  But we all know you HAVE to have Billy Zoom in the band. I haven't been able to see them, but this DVD will do the trick.  This DVD is AMAZING!! One listen/viewing makes me instantly forget all the ""power pop"" ""punk"" bands that are around now.  Their sound is fantastic, full, fast, heavy, thrilling!  All the members sound excellent, period.  I'm hopeful that there will be a tour, come on X!  Us old fogeys would like to see you old fogeys play your beautiful music for us!! UPDATE:  I've been so lucky to catch X a couple of times with Billy on guitar since I wrote this, it was just incredible seeing them, this DVD does give an accurate view of what it is like to have X RIPPING it up in concert!  cheers."
23,000503860X,5,"X is one of the best punk bands ever. I don't even like calling them a punk band, but that's what they call themselves so I guess it's OK. This is musically complex punk with a lot of influences and a lot of tight playing and gripping tunes.

This is an awesome concert. The only two problems are that 1) it is just 67 minutes long and 2) John Doe's bass is buried too deep in the mix.

Every X fan should get this. More importantly, anyone who doesn't know about X should get this.

Why X? Did you know, for example, that:
- X has a different sound based on the unique harmonies between co-lead singers Exene Cervenka and John Doe that really sets them apart from anything else out there?
- Doe, Cervenka and drummer DJ Bonebrake also play in the country punk band The Knitters?
- Billy Zoom, the guitarist who originally formed the band, used to play rockabilly guitar for Gene Vincent and other big stars, and has been voted one of the greatest guitar players ever by Guitar Player magazine?
- X were playing Leadbelly tunes way before Kurt Cobain?
- Ray Manzarek, keyboard player of The Doors, produced X's first four albums? This is one of the big reasons why the band covered and generally closed its concerts with ""Soul Kitchen"" from the album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Doors/dp/B000MCIBE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Doors</a>
- Cervenka and Doe used to be married, before Exene later married Viggo Mortensen -- Aragorn from the Lord of the Rings movies?
- Billy Zoom left the band from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, but during this time the band still managed to record&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Live-at-the-Whisky-a-Go-Go/dp/B000005IRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X Live at the Whisky a Go-Go</a>, one of the greatest live rock albums ever, with guitarist Tony Gilkyson?

As this DVD proves, X is still as good as ever. Billy Zoom still plays standing in his trademark splayed-leg stance with a broad grin on his face. Did I say he is awesome? Awesome.

I waited way too long before getting this one, thinking I could do without an X DVD. And I could have. But why should I? This really is worth it, and I'm sure I'll be putting this one in the player more often than a lot of my other music DVDs. Really, really good."
24,000503860X,5,"This is a fantastic video for anyone that is a fan of X or punk music. They sound as great as ever.
The DVD contains all the great songs. I look back fondly on the days when music was raw and real."
25,000503860X,5,"For all you X fans out there-you will love this DVD -X are a great band live, and if they aren't coming to your town on their tour-this may be the next best thing to seeing them live!"
26,000503860X,5,"I got this DVD as an Xmas gift. I was very hesitant as I did not want to ruin the greatness I had in my vivid memory of X on the Sunset Strip back in the day. Needless to say my trepidation was unwarranted.

This DVD is awesome. It is edited well and they sound great. Billy Zoom has not lost anything and  Bonebrake is as good as ever. John Doe still can sing and has the great bass line, Exene sounds good as well, all though the years have not treated her well.

A must buy for any X fan. Now if the UCLA bruins football can return to the 1979-1984 form as well as X -all would be good."
27,000503860X,5,"I've loved X since I first saw them here in San Francisco with, I believe, Devo and Romeo Void.  Romeo Void was a disaster due to the tiny outfit Deborah squeezed her huge body into; the audience couldn't stand to look at her even when the music was good. Devo was quite good. Then X came on stage and it was like hearing a great music system play compared to a tinny radio's sound. Man, they were great and they, unlike 99% of the other ""new wave/punk"" bands of the era were pros.  They had it down and played it up. I loved them! Watching this excellent reunion video (yes, Billy Zoom still has that same perpetual, inane smile on his face while playing), I was surprised to see very much the same show I saw all those years ago, with some extra songs that came out later, that is. The band's still electrifying. I'd like to see them ""live"" again, but until then, this video is the next best thing. It's well filmed and has a great selection of their best songs. Sure, they aren't as ""pretty"" as they used to be, but before you say too much, check your rearview mirror to see how you look now compared to 20 some odd years ago. Then, once humbled, go buy this CD. You will love it!"
28,000503860X,5,I think I saw X about 20 - 25 times from 1985 - 1995. They were always great and this brings back a lot of memories for me. They are a tight band that always sound great. I wish this had all of thier songs from that concert that is on the CD.
29,000503860X,5,"Being born in 1960 really ticked me off...Not old enough to really enjoy or not enjoy those carefree rock/roll, Dylanesque  years and awaiting my young adult years was the end of disco or the beginning of something in music called punk....Being a ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" landed me in the punk scene in the Bay Area...""Dead Kennedy's"" ""The Replacements"" and others were just either playing local clubs or being thrown into jail. Jello Biafra got married in a cemetary..Anywho, I was just shedding my Beatlemania and visiting nightclubs like DV8, One Step Beyond,181, Club X, Das Club, The Edge/Vortex, Face to Face, and Gotham City...I had seen ""X"" on New Year's night 1990 and being I was 30 decided this was my last year for dancing and clubbing...All the new wave/punk places were being torn down or remodeled for the next generation....That night I was blown away! Everyone in X had aged but still retained that youthful spirit and I tell ya it revitalized me! I danced all night long just like the old days....This DVD strangely enough revitilizes me again and had me tapping my feet, bobbing my head or singing along to ""We're Desperate"", ""White Girl"", ""Johnny Hit and Run Pauline""....It's definitely not a Beatles concert but the spirit and energy of the times will affect those of us growing up in those times and listening to that loud music....Geez, whatever happened to Dot Little? She's the one who asked me to be a punk with her! If you see her tell her I still love her!"
30,000503860X,5,"It just so happens that I was at this very show at the HOB in hollywood.  As a matter of fact, I can be seen in many of the shots of the crowd.  This show was nothing short of amazing.  After the show I was permitted to socialize with the band in the upstairs room.  Pretty cool for an old dude like myself.

If you know X, this is a must.  If you are young and new, it's a great place to get a taste of music history.

Dr. Draa"
31,000503860X,5,"I recently saw X live in Atlanta, Georgia and was blown away with thier amazing performance, this DVD displays how they still have a passion for playing punk rock music. Good picture and sound, if you like X, buy this testament of punk history!!!"
32,000503860X,5,"I must admit I was hesitant to purchase this DVD. A classic punk band performing twenty plus years later, what could one expect? Apparently, one can expect a hell of a lot. These guys and gal can still tear their songs apart.

It's well filmed; there isn't that MTV, rapid editing that can cause seizures. The audio is excellent; you can actually understand the lyrics. It's well mixed. It's far superior to a lot of live performance DVD's currently released by some bands. X released a product that is worthy of ones money.

If you like X; you'll love this DVD. If you just appreciate a good rock/punk concert, you won't be disappointed."
33,5419263,5,"WE have ""Hide 'Em In your Heart"" the first volume, and I cant say anything but great things about it. All my children love them ranging in age from 12 months to 11. They sing verses directly out of the bible. I find myself singing the verses throughout the day. It is a great tool to put a song in your heart that is in fact God's word. Also a great tool for scripture memorization."
34,5419263,5,"My husband and I have had Steve Green's Hide Em In Your Heart Vol's 1 and 2 playing in our home and cars for over 10 years as we have been raising our 7 children.  (We started with cassette tapes!) The quality is great, and the lyrics are simply Bible verses.  The best part is that you will not ""grow weary"" of listening to these as you do with some other children's music.  I recommend them to anyone with small children that is interested in teaching them Bible verses.  They will learn all of these wonderful verses in no time and fill your home with sweet music!"
35,5419263,5,"We have been playing this album to our 1-year old almost ever since she was born.  She loves the songs so much that sometime she likes to dance along, and sometimes the songs amazingly can calm her down.  All the songs are very pleasant to listen to for the baby and even for us, and we believe it is a great way to teach our daughter bible verses.  We would not need the DVD though if we were to buy it again."
36,5419263,5,"I heard about this cd/dvd on the radio and after reading the reviews here I bought it for my 2 year old son.  It is great, the songs are not long, very clever, and I don't mind listening to them over and over either.  My son loves watching the dvd and already knows some of the words, which is awesome because the words are straight from the bible."
37,5419263,5,"We all enjoy this video, the clothing is a bit outdated, but the verses and songs are timeless! My youngest children even are saying the  verses along with the narrator the first week!"
38,5419263,5,"We got this CD/DVD set for our 2 year old, and I can't say enough about the quality of the music and lyrics.  This is clean, healthy, happy music!  The music is beautifully arranged and doesn't sound like a low budget synthesizer.  This is actually well orchestrated and professionally recorded.  The lyrics are straight out of the Bible, and a terrific way to memorize scripture!  Our son has thoroughly enjoyed the music, and begs for us to play it for him over and over.  We have listened to the CD so many times I'm amazed it hasn't gotten worn out, and even more amazingly my husband and I are not sick of it...on the contrary, we are sincerely uplifted by it.  It hasn't gotten on our nerves, the way so many other kid's CD's do.  The DVD is definitely outdated, as far as the outfits go, but the content and the music are delightful!  Don't hesitate on this purchase...you won't be disappointed!"
39,5419263,5,"Excellent dvd, lots of fun and great songs!  Steve Green is a wonderful artist."
40,5419263,5,"The clothing is dated, but the music and words are timeless.  My son has learned so much from watching this DVD.  We don't watch much television, but this is a great DVD for young children.  The music is catchy (but not irritating as a lot of childrens music is), and the words are straight out of scripture.  There is a nice variety of upbeat songs and quieter songs.  My son is almost 2, and he asks for his ""Bible Kids"" ALL the time.  Our copy is several years old and scratched, I came looking on Amazon to buy a replacement, but it is unavailable.  I hope if it is out of production that it will be remade in the future, I wish there were more DVD's like this on the market for kids.  I give this a five star rating for content and quality.  If you are going to be annoyed by the very 80's style clothing, I'll give it a four ;)"
41,5419263,5,My grandkids loved this and it made it easy for them to learn scripture verses I a fun way. The DVD was a great bonus.
42,5419263,4,"Just like volume 1, this is an excellent collection of Scripture songs with short explanations in between. Once you get past the late 80s/early 90s clothing and hair styles, the DVD is fun. I purchased this for my 3 year old as the whole family loves volume 1. Some observations:
1. Compared to Volume 1, the verse selection is a little weak but still profitable. Volume 1 verses are readily applicable to a young child and understood. Volume 2 verses are best understood with a little more context, so perhaps a slightly older child who already knows some Bible.
2. Vocal ranges: As a former music teacher, I tend to be very picky about vocal ranges for children. In general, D to D is best. This volume has multiple songs that go lower briefly. Still, it's not nearly as low as a lot of the children's music I hear coming out now.
3. Pitch: Several of the songs feature children who aren't quite on pitch. In the video, you see the child in context and it's cute. But on the CD, it jarring to my ears. If it were just at the end of a song as a cute touch, it wouldn't be bad, but having an out-of-tune singer lead a song is just painful. Now, this probably would not drive the average non-musician crazy at all, so take this comment with a grain of salt.
4. Song complexity: In volume 1, the song was first presented in its simplest form and then repeated with added complexity. In volume 2, the complexity is sometimes brought in at the beginning. This is just fine for a slightly older child.

Even with these critiques, I am pleased with this CD/DVD. My daughter loves it, and I love that she's getting God's truth engrained into her heart. If I didn't have volume 1 to compare it with, I probably would have given it 5 stars."
43,5419263,4,I'm happy with my purchase
44,5419263,5,The little ones love this
45,5419263,5,We LOVE this at our house!!! My 4 year old knows all of the songs and I catch her singing them constantly. Our toddler loooooves watching the DVD and dances to the CD whenever we put it in. She even hums along and chimes in a word here and there where she can!
46,5419263,5,Love it!!  Great way to teach children the Bible in a fun way.  (Side bonus--adults are reminded of the Biblical truths again.)
47,5419263,5,One of our family's favorites!  Still singing the songs 15 years later :)
48,5419263,3,Good songs. The DVD is a little boring.
49,5419263,4,"Not as memorable as Volume 1, but delightful all the same, and helpful for little ones to learn important scripture passages to guide them through life!"
50,5419263,5,"Loved volume 1, and now there's another volume to learn songs to scripture and life lessons.  This is a great way to get scripture in our hearts!"
51,5419263,5,"Fun for kids ~ inside and out.
Best way to get God's Word in their hearts and on their minds."
52,5419263,5,"This video may be dated, but my grandchildren listen and watch is almost daily.  Even I find myself singing along at randomly times when it isn't even playing."
53,5419263,5,The CD Is great and teaching kids the Word of God through song! The DVD is 80s and you can tell but still great and clear!
54,5419263,5,My granddaughter loves it! This is her bedtime music; she walks around the house singing SCRIPTURE.Steve Green's voice is that strong tender that brings respect for the WORD of GOD.
55,5419263,3,I have the VHS.  I bought the DVD in order to be able to jump to different tracks.  This feature is not present on the DVD.
56,5419263,5,"When I was a little girl, my parents had both the VHS tapes and the cassettes for both Hide 'Em In Your Heart volumes. We also saw Steve Green do these live a time or two.  My siblings and I knew every song by heart, and we loved them.

Now, I have children of my own.  My daughter, barely two years old now, was given this DVD/CD combo pack by her Nonni and Poppop.  She knows all the songs.  Just yesterday she ran around singing ""My Father's House . . . Mickey Mansions . . . Prepare a place for YOU, for YOU!""  I almost cried with joy.

Having my children learn the Bible through these songs is priceless, especially since this was (and often still is) how I learned and remembered Scripture growing up.  The songs are short enough to hold interest and are easily learned by even the youngest child. My son is seven months old and, while he is too young to sing them, he recognizes them to the point that he will stop screaming and begin giggling and smiling when he hears the music begin.

Each song is introduced by the corresponding Bible verse and often a brief, simple explanation to help little ones understand what is being taught.

I cannot recommend this highly enough.  Get this music for your children and grandchildren and watch in wonder as they sing Bible verses all day long.  Hide 'Em In Your Heart got five stars from me as a child, and it has ten stars from me as a parent!"
57,5419263,5,My son loves this video!  It came in perfect condition and in a very timely manner.  I would recommend this for parents with young children.
58,5419263,2,"I usually don't like giving negative reviews, but I ordered the CD/DVD combo and just got the DVD. It was in good condition, but not the complete order."
59,5419263,5,"I grew up with this on VHS, thats why I bought it for my boys. Loved that it was a DVD/CD combo. One in the house ,other in the car. My boys are entranced by this movie. I get so much done without them underfoot when its running"
60,5419263,5,"I have three small children, one doesn't even watch tv yet.  The three and four year old will sit and watch the video.  It's great because as they go about singing the songs they are learning scripture.  No they don't understand everything, but it's hiding in their hearts for when they will need it later.  OK, a little silly, but they seem to like it."
61,5419263,5,"We enjoyed the original VHS, so I was already impressed with the content.
What a great treat to purchase the CD and the DVD together.  My whole
family loves it: my toddler enjoys the music and interaction; my teen feels
nostalgic about it; my husband and I are pleased with the content and
presentation."
62,5419263,5,"Arrived quickly, in great shape, and exactly as I requested.  It is a great CD for helping to learn the Scriptures."
63,5419263,5,"The video is terribly dated, but the singing is so nice.  My daughter loves both the DVD and the cd."
64,5419263,5,"I have enjoyed this video for many years with my nephew and nieces.  As soon as my daughter was old enought to enjoy it, I purchased it.  She loves to watch other kids and she loves to sing and dance.  All of that along with a very good way to remember age appropriate scripture makes this video a must have for my family!"
65,5419263,5,"I loved this video and want to order 2 more for my grandchildren.  It gives a simple, easy to understand explanation of the Bible verse and then the verse set to appropriate muusic!"
66,5419263,5,"Finally! Scripture songs that are geared towards kids that are so nice to listen to! Steve Green has my kids memorizing scripture, and me too! Everyone loves these songs!"
67,5419263,5,"The C.D. / DVD is wonderful, the music is great...but there are no performance tracks for our 3 & 4 year old choir.  And there is no sheet music available either.

The music is really great, but it needs to be supported for children's choirs."
68,5419263,5,The DVD came in great condition and provided lots of entertaining minutes of reliving the past.  Definitely worth the money.
69,5419263,5,What a great way to instill the Word of God in your child's heart. It has been a treasure to hear my 4 year old sing these songs out of the blue. The music is well done and encouraging. I find it is so good for my heart too.
70,5419263,5,"Wonderful, fun way to teach truths to children.  Every child I know loves these videos and songs.  Good for parents too."
71,5092663,5,Watch this and learn how we ended up in the state we are in as a dying country.
72,5092663,5,"Every American should see this, especially if they are of the liberal persuasion! The only thing I would change is to have the words of the various quotes on the screen as they were being spoken. That would make a greater impact, and make it easier to pause the video and copy the quotes down.

The video may seem somewhat disjointed and not cover some of the events very deeply, but there is a reason for this. It is organized chronologically, rather than topically, which causes it to appear disjointed. As far as the depth of the coverage, if everything was covered in depth, it would have to be a 12-CD set! At least!

The video does a very good job of covering the highlights of what brought us from a godly nation to where we are today. Other than the David Barton videos, this is the best one I have seen on the topic so far."
73,5092663,5,Every evangelical Christian should be familiar with the information provided in this video.
74,5092663,3,"After reading other users' reviews and WND promotion, I was looking forward to an exciting, uplifting story about the U.S. With a few exceptions (ACLU and PP backgrounders), the presentation was tedious and the storyline disjointed. Example: a short segment on the Crusades; now let's talk about Christopher Columbus. Five minutes later you learn the connection. Now let's talk about something else! The quotations selected from our founding fathers are appropriate, but their vocabularly and writing style---while more advanced than most people's today---get in the way of the points being made.

Maybe it gets better towards the end. I started to fall asleep around 1920, so have not finished the DVD. Sorry. I wanted to like it but..."
75,5092663,5,"This was an amazing DVD that I definitely recommend.  What I found interesting was the background and beginning of both, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU!  It actually turned my stomach a couple times.  Hopefully you enjoy it as well."
76,5092663,5,"I enjoyed the Gospel focused presentation of the history of our nation, but one section regarding the trial of a soldier for homosexuality is inappropriate for younger children. Also, later in the movie there are some clips of violence against a church by homosexual activists covered by news reports that would be too strong from young children.  Lastly, open displays of affection by homosexuals is covered by news reports at the end of the movie as well.  My advice is to view the movie yourself first and then determine what sections you can allow your children to view.  If you are not a Christian, you'll hate this movie."
77,5092663,5,"A great video that should be shown in schools, churches,etc. Provides an interesting historical perspective. Very well done and presented."
78,5092663,5,"This documentay takes you on a journey...from Christopher Columbus to Jamestown...from Valley Forge to the Constitutional Convention...from the Civil War to the Industrial Revolution...from World War I to the Stock Market Crash...from FDR to the present. Our journey will give a basic grasp of God's sovereign hand behind the history of our nation, which our forefathers so clearly understood. The result of this journey will give us a better understanding of where America is today, how she arrived here, and where she must turn at this critical hour.

79,5092663,5,"I grew up in Independence, Missouri the ""show me state"".  When I was in Junior high and we were studing about World War II and the atom bomb, from my history class I looked out the window to see Harry S. Truman walking to city hall to vote with a secrete serviceman by his side.  But I learned more American History from NATION ADRIFT than I did in high school and college.  Plus, I saw things that are rarely mentioned now, perhaps because we are all trying to be so politically correct that we left a few things out that really happened.  Seeing is believing."
80,5092663,5,This is a real eye opener. You will feel outraged and saddened by what has slowly happened to this country. You will feel inspired to fight the good fight in order to not lose any more ground to the liberals in our country. You will get an insight to the US Court sytems and how their controversial decisions have slowly eroded our freedoms and challenge the very fabric that this great nation was founded upon.
81,5092663,3,"Less than I expected, but OK film"
82,5092663,5,It is a great book about History!
83,5092663,4,REALLY ENJOYED
84,5092663,5,Excellent timeline of our nation's history. I would highly recommend.
85,5092663,5,excellent as usual
86,5092663,5,"A great read.  So much historical info.

Thank you,"
87,5092663,5,Worthwhile for the whole family to see andvtoncirculaye among friends.  Very well done!
88,5092663,5,Should be a must read
89,5092663,5,Well done video with important information that Americans should know.
90,5092663,5,This is a great movie if you love the USA
91,5092663,5,A must see for everyone. The ones who get it will understand. The blind will pass it off.
92,5092663,5,really good help me understand a few things must see
93,5092663,5,This is a must see very informative
94,5092663,4,This hits our situation on the spot.
95,5092663,5,"Show the decline of courage, honor and moral character by showing America like it is in 2014 today - a must see!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
96,5092663,5,I had watched parts of this film before.  Man I'm glad I got to watch it all.  The historical background on Planned Parenthood and the ACLU is information everyone should have.  I will be recommending this to everyone.
97,5092663,2,"While there was a lot of information in this piece (some of it coming at your faster than a freight train, another down side of the video), there is no doubt that it was produced as right-wing propaganda, which means I'm not able to use it as I hoped (for my children's home schooling). One large section of the video is a series of quotes from historical U. S. leaders, mentioning God and/or the Bible -- the quotes are simply inserted without any background or even a common-ground to relate each of them."
98,5092663,5,"If you love God and Country, this exposes another layer of the attack against both. well work the time watching ans sharing with your friends"
99,5092663,5,"There is an essential message here that is not being told in society today.  People claim that this nation was not founded on Christianity, and that the writers of the Constitution were actually Deists rather than Christians.  There is a preponderance of evidence over centuries of time presented here, including the wording of documents such as the Mayflower Compact, that establish the Christian heritage of this nation unapologetically beyond refute, as a matter of history.

The other story that is not being told is the origins and destructive objectives of organizations such as Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).  The founder of Planned Parenthood was interested in eugenics, and specifically in reducing the number of Blacks to survive being born in this country.  Efforts by the ACLU to remove prayer and the Bible from school are shown to be in direct conflict with the statements by the founding fathers about what they considered to be essential for a proper education that would equip the youth of this country for effective citizenship.  The redefinition of marriage to include homosexual relationships is shown to be tearing at the fabric of the traditional family, and of the stability of our society.

We HAVE become A Nation Adrift, and much of that comes from ignorance of how this country was founded, and of the sacrifices that were made along the way.  This DVD would be beneficial for viewing in every home, school, and church in this country."
100,5092663,5,"This movie should be seen by everyone. It chronicles how this country started and quickly became the greatest, freest, and most prosperous country in the world through faith in God and freedom. And how and why we are losing that greatness, freedom and prosperity."
101,5092663,4,"Haters will say this is biased, that the founding fathers were not christians, or that they were deists...and maybe that's true for some of the ff. But this documentary is very informative. Our nation started as something it is most certainly not anymore. And we are falling. This movie gives insight as to why."
102,5092663,5,What a great video that gives the early history of our great country!  I'd highly recommend this to everyone - especially for school children that are not learning the history of our country.
103,5092663,4,"This video presents a very good capsular History of our country and its founding principles.  It the progresses on through the history of america and how the fabric of what once made her an unusual nation began to deteriorate.  America was founded through a war that broke the shackles of a tyrant King George and on the basis of religious freedom. Many were still not free and so a second war would ensue .  Family, Faith, personal responsibility, generosity, work, morality, integrity and freedom are all part of that legacy.  Oven the decades those have been eroded.  This is the story of how and when it happened."
104,5092663,5,I found this dvd put together with historical facts and visuals that kept my interest in the issues discussed. would recommend 6-12 grade classes watching this.
105,5092663,5,"Well done!  I will definitely be showing this to my children when they get a little older.  This is the documentary you will never see in our public school system these days.  Ironically, it is the one documentary that you should have to see before you graduate.  It is amazing how far our country has fallen from the original intentions of our Founding Fathers.  This is a great reminder of what liberalism and political correctness has done to the United States of America."
106,5092663,5,This is the history we need to be teaching in our schools. Everyone should see this!
107,5092663,4,I like the purchase of this video because the price was great and the shipping was fast.
108,5092663,1,"The video has a half truth view, The view of Woodrow Wilson is very liberal and does not tell of the Socialistic agenda he was forcing on our country. I actually threw this dvd in the garbage after I watched it. Any false history is not history but should be considered fiction."
109,5092663,5,A Nation Adrift is a must see documentary.  It tells you what your history books didn't or tells your children what they don't hear in school.  This true American history needs to be shown in every church across the United States.  We as Christians have failed to guard what God has given us.  God have mercy on us.  LW
110,5092663,5,Really excellent piece of work showing the beliefs of the founding fathers and what is happening now to our nation.
111,5019281,5,"Of course it's impossible to separate Henry Winkler from his famous Fonzie persona, but he actually does a great job as a Scrooge-character in this movie.  His performance is quiet and subdued, not overdone as we might expect from such an intense actor.  I thought Winkler did a great job chaning out of his Fonzie image and taking on the roll of an embittered and lonely miser.
Actually the characters Winkler plays aren't all that different from each other.  Slade felt abandoned and betrayed by those he'd loved, and Fonzie was also abandoned by his parents.  Winkler's parents turned their backs on him when he was a young man because he wanted to be an actor instead of following the family business.  I believe that's why he does rolls like this so well.
I was quite surprised to find this movie available on DVD and have gladly purchased it to add to my collection of Christmas movies."
112,5019281,5,"When this first aired in 1979, I enjoyed it so much I clean forgot it was ""A Christmas Carol"".  I wanted to see it over and over again thoughout the year.  When I finally got a copy on VHS, I got that wish.  Now I finally got the DVD copy and am I glad.  To see Henry Winkler as the best Scrooge or variation on him since Alistair Sim in the 1951 version now on DVD is a treat for the gods.  Although I have both the 1984 and 1999 made for television films made with George Scott and Patrick Stewart on DVD, this version was the first attempt to bring the classic Dickens tale to the small screen. It is as just as enjoyable today as it was 20 plus years ago, and this way it will live forever.  Get it now and on disc before it gets away."
113,5019281,5,"I must confess to being a bit of a coinsure of Dickens' classic tale.  I have many versions of it and always love seeing the various interpretations offered.  This one, however, continues to be one of my all time favorites.  The change of setting forces the film to explain elements of the book that most films overlook because they assume you're already familiar with the story.  Examples of this include how Scrooge (Slade in the film) could be so mean and yet think himself a just man, also the reason the ghost of his dead partner is miserable (not understanding the need to do good until he has lost the power).  Add to this the wonderful performances by Winkler et al and you've got an absolutely classic film.
In my opinion, this version of Dickens' story is closer to the original spirit of his work than many less derivative versions.  The material is handled with reverence and respect and it shows, the settings and characters are well conceived, and the look of the film is faithful to the period.  All in  all an excellent holiday piece well worth the money."
114,5019281,3,"If you already have (and love) the Alistair Sim version (Scrooge, 1951), the Reginald Owen version (1938) and Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol (no, I'm not kidding, it's beautifully done), this will be an interesting film for comparison.
Two good points stand out for this version of Dicken's classic Christmas story:
1) Since it is an adaptation, set in a different time and place from the original (Depression-era New England), deviations from the text and basic plot-line, are not as bothersome as they are in the films that adapt the story in ""Dickensian"" England.
2) Henry Winkler, who, at the time, was playing against his well-known Fonz character, gives an excellent characterization to the Scrooge-like Benedict Slade.
George C. Scott and Albert Finney give detailed performances as Scrooge in their version, and the films that feature them have good production values -- and, in the case of the Finney version a couple of good songs -- but the deviations in text in the Scott version and the added material in the Finney version (Scrooge in hell -- what?) are both unnecessary and more than a little annoying."
115,5019281,4,"Henry Winkler proves his acting ability in this American version of the Dickens classic. One will actually forget that he was 'The FONZ' and will be amazed at his transformation from nice guy to mean guy back to nice guy. The general feel of this movie, though, is grey. That's the best way to describe it. But then, it was a bleak grey time in American history, with the Great Depression and all. When Dickens originally wrote the book, it was a grey time in England's history as well, so the subdued feeling one gets while watching this 'modern' version fits in well with the spirit of the original story.
A nice twist (sorry, Oliver!) to a true classic.
By the way, for my money, the finest original version out there is the George C. Scott version followed closely by Alistair Sim."
116,5019281,5,i thought that actor dorian harewood was fantastic in this role.
117,5019281,4,"Being a huge fan of this classic, I own dozens of versions and this one  adds a nice variety.  The twists and changes to this timeless story truly  do justice to the original and the performances, for the most part, are  stellar.  If you're looking for the same feel good movie but in a new  setting, this one's for you."
118,5019281,5,One of my family's favorite Christmas movies ever. Henry Winkler is wonderful!
119,5019281,5,as described
120,5019281,5,Nice movie
121,5019281,5,A good movie with morals
122,5019281,5,"My favorite "" Christmas Carol""."
123,5019281,5,Love the twist on this classic!
124,5019281,5,Love the movie.
125,5019281,5,"An inspirational version of the Christmas Carol, enjoyable and upbeat"
126,5019281,5,This TV movie brought back fond memories of the first time my wife and I watched it in the late 70's. Henry Winkler did a great job with the character of an American Scrooge. It was radical change from the Fonz.
127,5019281,5,"More of a 'modern' version of the classic.  I didn't think I'd be impressed when my parents took this out but I gave it a try and have to say...what a great adaptation.  The cast was great, Winkler was exceptional.  I was very happy to see this on Amazon and happened to catch it when the price went way down so I snapped it up.  Great timeless classic...and Winkler really surprised me with his portrayal."
128,5019281,5,Perfect!
129,5019281,5,"Our previous dvd of An American Christmas Carol was lost and as this is one of my husband's favorite Christmas movies I bought it for him.  The quality of this new version is much, much better than what we had before.  I would highly recommend it !"
130,5019281,5,"A rare classic,  a good movie."
131,5019281,5,I've always loved this version of a Christmas Carol.  Henry Winkler does a great job portraying a 1930's American version of Scrooge.  The video quality is decent too!
132,5019281,2,Terrible soulless version of the classic Dickens tale
133,5019281,5,"Saw this as a kid/teenager and really liked it. Even though it was set in the Depression era, I found it a more  contemporary and relatable version of the story. Who knew the Fonz could be something other than the Fonz? Good story and enjoyable."
134,5019281,5,"One of our favorite renditions of The Christmas Carol!  Of course, any movie with Henry Winkler is bound to be good.  We also ordered a DVD (Hallmark movie) he starred in, ""The Most Wonderful Time of the Year"", which will not dissapoint Henry Winkler fans!"
135,5019281,5,The Christmas Carol is my all time favorite story.  I haven't found a version that I haven't disliked yet.  This one was no exception.  Henry Winkler did an awesome joy portraying the Scrooge like character.
136,5019281,5,"Heard about this movie saw it years ago. Husband wanted to see it, I just added it to my christmas movie collection."
137,5019281,5,Me and my husband love this movie
138,5019281,5,Great movie thank you !!!
139,5019281,3,Well made Christmas movie. It's a little slow but sweet natured.
140,5019281,5,Great spin on the Classic Christmas Story by the master C. Dickens...
141,5019281,5,"Great product, fast shipping"
142,5019281,5,I love  this movie.  Bought for myself
143,5019281,5,Perfect family tradition movie!!
144,5019281,5,great movie
145,5019281,5,"We loved it. Henry Winkler is a great actor and we missed it not being on TV this year, so we had to buy it for our collection.  Thanks"
146,5019281,4,This movie is better than it ought to be. Authentic settings and costuming for America 1930's Depression Era. The Scrooge character really does a good changeover. In old TV 4:5 ratio.
147,5019281,5,Good movie
148,5019281,3,OK
149,5019281,4,Love this movie it is a twist from the Original!
150,5019281,5,great adaptation of dickens classic Henry winkler is a gifted actor
151,5019281,5,I have been looking for this dvd for a long time. Love Henry Winkler in the movie
152,5019281,5,"There are MANY versions of ""A Christmas Carol"" out there. In my humble opinion, this feature length story, set in America during the Great Depression, starring Henry Winkler in the ""Scrooge"" role, is BY FAR the finest interpretation of the classic story. It's as Dickens would have written if he had lived in America in the 1930's. The human drama is REAL, and the joyful ending brings Dickens' ending into the American culture. BIG smile !"
153,5019281,5,Henry Winkler puts his talent of playing the scrooge very well. I'm very glad to own it.
154,5019281,5,One of the movies I watch every Christmas season. Replaced VHS with DVD
155,5019281,5,A classic
156,5019281,5,Awesome show.
157,5019281,5,I've watching this movie for several Christmas seasons and I just love it!
158,5019281,5,I've always liked the Scrooge movies and this one was a nice twist.
159,5019281,5,this is my all time fav christmas movie.  if you haven't seen this version you need to check it out at least once in your life.
160,5019281,4,Certainly not the best or my favorite but still very enjoyable!
161,5019281,5,Always loved this version of a Christmas Carol.
162,5019281,5,"Henry Winkler, cute as ever.  This movie is a nice addition to my Christmas Carol collection."
163,5019281,5,I bought this because I love the movie and i watch it every year
164,5019281,5,Good movie. Good buy.
165,5019281,5,My husband likes to watch and compare all of the Christmas Carol movies at the holiday. We were glad to be able to find this version.
166,5019281,4,good
167,5019281,5,Well Done! Enjoyed it ! Will put on my list to watch every holiday season
168,5019281,2,We got bored and didn't finish the film.
169,5019281,4,"Found ""An American Christmas Carol"" to be enjoyable. In my opinion, it didn't rise to the level of the film versions of the Dickens Christmas Carol, but it was worth watching."
170,5019281,5,We have always loved the Christmas Carol. This American version was thoroughly enjoyed.
171,5019281,5,An excellent Christmas movie
172,5019281,5,Excellent movie. Must watch for all c.e.o.'s
173,5019281,5,Will surely be a classic.
174,5019281,5,Fantastic movie
175,5019281,4,Henry Winkler was great in this.
176,5019281,3,Is among my favorite updated versions of A Christmas Carol.
177,5019281,2,Very slow start. The old grouch was not too believable since he was such a terrible jerk! Acting is sub-par
178,5019281,4,A new twist on the classic Christmas Carol but still good. The setting is New Hampshire where I grew up.
179,5019281,3,"Pleasant story, predictable outcome, but holds your attention."
180,5019281,5,"I've seen ACC several times over the years and it has really grown on me as a homey American rendition of Dickens' classic work. It has it's own charm and message while maintaining inspiration of the original. One of the reasons I bought ACC from Amazon is that television has overlooked it, which is unfortunate."
181,5019281,5,Excellent DVD!  Thanks Amazon.
182,5019281,5,I'm a total fan of the story always nice to see different versions
183,5019281,5,"I've always loved watching ""American Christmas Carol"". Tradition in our family."
184,5019281,5,"This movie is really good,I loved it"
185,5019281,3,Didn't have the impact that the older versions had
186,5019281,5,"If your a true believer of A Christmas Carol, then the FONZ is right there on top."
187,5019281,3,It was OK but not the best.
188,5019281,4,It is classic Dickens with an American twist- timeless!
189,5019281,5,Wonderful movie. Well made and Henry Winkler was amazing in this roll.
190,5019281,5,Classic
191,5019281,5,This has been a favorite of ours for many years.
192,5019281,4,"My husband and I were looking for a Christmas movie to watch and stumbled across this one randomly. We chose it because of Henry Winkler. We were both pleasanly surprised at how much we liked it. It was a nice update on the classic story, even though it's ""old"" now. We both recommend it."
193,5019281,5,Like
194,5019281,5,Great movie.
195,5019281,4,I like Henry Winkler playing Scrooge. Plus it was sent what different than the original.
196,5019281,5,Great
197,5019281,5,"I've seen this one before and I loved it.  I thought Henry Winkler was awesome, as was the rest of the cast."
198,5019281,2,"Hate to say it, but this is an example of a re-make falling short of the mark."
199,5019281,4,A great contemporary perspective of A Christmas Carol!
200,5019281,5,"Great price, great quality, will buy from seller again"
201,5019281,5,Loved this modern version
202,5019281,5,"I was thrilled to see, ""An American Christmas Carol"", on the Prime list.  I love the Dicken's story and this was a worthy adaptation that I remembered from my original viewing more than 30 years ago.  Set in early 20th century America, there are a few simple changes from the classic version.  Scrooge is a money lender, having grown rich by lending, then repossessing merchandise when his clients could not keep up on payments.
The ghosts of Christmas past, present and future are represented by some of the clients.  But, anyone familiar with ""The Christmas Carol"", will have no trouble recognizing the storyline.
Feel good, holiday favorite."
203,5019281,4,Thought it was a very good interpretation of A Christmas Carol. Henry Winkler did a good job as Mr. Slate (Scrooge). I would recommend this movie if you are a fan.
204,5019281,5,Great alternative version of A Christmas Carol.
205,5019281,3,Good movie but been done sooooo many times
206,5019281,1,did not like
207,5019281,2,I just did not like this version...still like the old originals.
208,5019281,4,Little slow
209,5019281,3,"It was an ok adaptation, but I still prefer the original version."
210,5019281,4,Classic Christmas movie
211,5019281,1,Do not waste your time.  This is not Dickens.  Even Henry Winkler cannot save this.
212,5019281,5,I was getting tired of the same holiday movies that run every day at christmas.  I love this old movie.  Great to watch during the holidays!!  Me & my husband watched it on Christmas Eve.
213,5019281,3,Not what I expected.  Very low budget.
214,5019281,5,excellent movie
215,5019281,2,Not very good.
216,5019281,5,Great movie
217,5019281,3,"This was a nice adaptation of the classic Dickens tale. Seeing Winkler as the ""Scrooge"" character left me waiting for an ""Ayyyyyyy!""  at some point but overall quite watchable."
218,5019281,1,A good movie for the family. But was too dull and boring for me. Bad makeup job on Henry Winkler. Worst rendition of Scrooge I've ever seen.
219,5019281,5,"killer movie
i watch it every christmas"
220,5019281,5,Very well done!  Henry Winkler performed flawlessly!

224,5019281,5,A nice twist on a classic.
225,5019281,5,One of my all time favorite renditions of Scrooge. Henry Winkler does a fabulous job as the lead character.
226,5019281,5,Very good. The best thing Henry Winkler EVER did.
227,5019281,4,good variation of a theme.
228,5019281,4,"A sweet movie with Henry Winkler ""The Christmas Carol"" genre."
229,5019281,4,Henry Winkler does a great job in this American twist of a holiday classic!
230,5019281,5,This is a classic scrooge movie but set in the 30's and I love Henry Winkler!

249,5019281,5,"I love this version of ""A Christmas Carol"" and it certainly shows Henry Winkler's acting abilities. Makes me cry every time I watch it."
250,5019281,5,Awesome
251,5019281,2,Very Slow
252,5019281,3,It was okay. I prefer the original story.
253,5019281,5,"Great classic, the Fonz rules"
254,5019281,5,I am a Henery Winkler fan
255,5019281,3,"A different take on the movie ""A Christmas Carol"" but not overly exciting."
256,5019281,5,I had forgotten how cute this movie was.
257,5019281,2,Pathetic reproduction of the Dickens classic. Interesting that the movie is particularly concerned with  the problem of people who lose their possessions to money lenders--corporations not unlike the ones which own directly or indirectly the media which present us with the American version of the Christmas carol.
258,5019281,5,Very good movie.  Christmas classic.
259,5019281,2,This was a terribly boring movie; glad I didn't pay to see it.
260,5019281,5,"I love this movie. Brings back memories to when I first saw it. Henry Winkler is wonderful as an American ""Scrooge"". It is set during the Depression of the 1930s. And ""tiny Tim"" is a young boy who has been hit with polio."
261,5019281,5,A classic!
262,5019281,5,American twist on a classic tale.
263,5019281,3,Fleur bleu.
264,5019281,4,Worth watching if you like dickens
265,5019281,5,I love this movie
266,5019281,4,"A pleasant surprise. Went to this with not a lot of positive expectation, just given the premise, but I do like Henry Winkler. Entertaining, but not in a ""want to watch it again"" way."
267,5019281,5,I love this twist of the Christmas Carol
268,5019281,3,It was okay.  Have seen better versions of the Christmas Carol.
269,5019281,5,A magnificent Christian film.
270,5019281,5,It was very well done. Great movie!
271,5019281,5,This is a more modern look at this age old tale. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this again after many years.
272,5019281,5,It was great!!!!!Been years since we watched the movie.
273,5019281,5,Since I love Henry Winkler this is an easy one to enjoy. Henry is such a great actor.
274,5019281,4,Was a good movie
275,5019281,5,"I remember watching this as a young kid. I've looked for it for years. Honestly, the story line is not as great as I remembered, but the fact that I could find it to view on Amazon warranted my inflated rating."
276,5019281,3,Ok Christmas Movie
277,5019281,3,It's okay
278,5019281,4,"Honestly - we started watching this particular ""Christmas Carol"" because it was the only one that was free with Prime.  Took a few minutes to get used to, but it was actually nice having an American twist on the story.  We ended up enjoying it very much."
279,5019281,5,"My favorite version  taken from ""A Christmas Carol""."
280,5019281,4,Nice twist to the original.
281,5019281,3,Not bad
282,5019281,5,"It's a good version if you are wanting something less dark than the original.  Plus, who doesn't love the Fonz?"
283,5019281,1,Slow moving. Boring.  Never finished it.
284,5019281,5,A great modern version of an old Scrooge story that todays kids can relate to.  Henry's acting is outstanding!
285,5019281,5,One to watch every year
286,5019281,4,Has always been my favorite Christmas Carol. Quality not that good because it was made for television in the 70's but a yearly watch for us
287,5019281,4,I thought it was a good Christmas movie.
288,5019281,1,worst version ever ... don't do it.
289,5019281,5,"I don't understand why this has not become a Christmas staple. My family enjoyed it when it was first shown, enjoyed it a couple of seasons probably and then it went away. I was very pleased to find it a couple of years ago. We love all things ""Scrooge"" at our house. Enjoy!"
290,5019281,4,"Just really great! I never knew the Fonze played Scrooge. Well, the characters' names are all different, there's no nephew, the ghost of Christmas future talks, but the basic story line is the same old wonderful classic. I really enjoyed this movie and I think you will too!"
291,5019281,5,My favorite Christmas Carol movie.  Wonderfully done.
292,5019281,5,great
293,5019281,5,It was great seeing this again. I remember when it first came out. Henry Winkler was still the Fonz. I remember how strange it was seeing him in this role. A great take on Mr. Dickens classic story.
294,5019281,4,"This is your classic Christmas Carol with Henry Winkler playing Scrooge. He was actually fairly young when he played this part. They did a great job making him look like an old man. Of course, Henry did a great job with the acting portion. The ending in this take was a little unbelievable as Scroodge was very old by that time. Still a very uplifting film with a good lesson for life."
295,5019281,5,A lovely surprise!
296,5019281,4,good clean enterainment
297,5019281,4,It was a different twist on a classic. I enjoyed it
298,5019281,3,Decent scrooge. I watch it yearly
299,5019281,3,Henry Winkler was out of his element.
300,5019281,5,Great movie!
301,5019281,4,Fine acting by Henry Winkler and supporting cast.  Nice version of the many films that have been made of A Christmas Carol.
302,5019281,5,Very well done.
303,5019281,5,"Great acting, great job"
304,5019281,3,Slowwwwwwww
305,5019281,5,I think this is a great twist on Charles Dickens Christmas Classic. Definitely worth watching
306,5019281,3,Wife liked it!  Old TV Special!
307,5019281,5,Very good movie
308,5019281,5,For fans of the Dickens story this remains fresh today! For fans of Henry Winkler it delivers with his Fonzi good looks and particular method of acting - very focused and sharp with movement and dialogue. Great watch for the Happy Days familiar.
309,5019281,5,Same classic with different characters......love this movie.
310,5019281,4,I enjoyed this version of the Christmas Carol. It had some new ideas and interpretations which I found interesting. I enjoyed Henry Winkler's interpretation of the Scrooge character.
311,5019281,5,"I never imagined I could see a version of A Christmas Carol that could be as good as the original. But this version passes that challenge with flying colors! All the actors come together to give a stellar performance. If you have gotten bored or grown tired of the same old classic, I challenge you to give this version a try. You won't be disappointed."
312,5019281,5,"well made, good acting for all"
313,5019281,4,"enjoyed another version of ""The Christmas Carol"", story still comes through"
314,5019281,5,"THERE IS A REASON I LOVE HENRY WINKLER, FOREVER MY FAV, THANKS MR. WINKLER!"
315,5019281,5,Love this....watch it every year....what a message
316,5019281,5,It was very exciting.  It is a twist on the real Christmas Carol.  We loved it!
317,5019281,5,Very good!
318,5019281,4,Good remake of the classic
319,5019281,5,"I can recall watching Henry Winkler on a talk show when this movie came out on television.  He asked the viewers to let him know what we thought of him in this role as it was different from the ones most had come to know him (eg.  ""The Fonz"").  When I watched it over 30 years ago, I enjoyed it.  It wasn't until recently I sought it out and watched it again.  It is an excellent retelling of the Dicken's classic with an Americanized twist.  The lessons are timeless and Henry Winkler's Mr Slade is really well done and believable.

If you are fan of a Christmas Carol and have seen many of the cinematic variations and made for TV, this is one you really have to see."
320,5019281,5,One of my favorites!
321,5019281,5,While Winkler's make up job is dated and not realistic this version is well done . A nice story . So glad we found it on Amazon after seeing it back on 1979 on TV
322,5019281,2,Such phoney acting!
323,5019281,5,Excellent story that reminds you - to love yourself and other as God/Jesus loves you.
324,5019281,4,Great family movie
325,5019281,1,Aweful is too good a word for this piece if crap. Talented actors couldn't salvage a lousy attempt to modernize a clasic. I'm ashamed to say I wasted two hours of my life watching this wretched turd in its entirety because I was too lazy to find something else.
326,5019281,4,Love Henry Winkler as a Scrooge-like character.
327,5019281,4,"Good story for the family, and a great message."
328,5019281,5,"Love Henry Winkler! He's a convincing ""Scrooge"" with a meltable heart. Really liked the way the story wrote in the not-so-ghostly ""ghosts"" of past, present and future Christmases. And we just love a happy ending, don't we?"
329,5019281,4,Nice take on this story. And to think this was Henry Winkler around his Happy Days era.
330,5019281,5,I love this version of The Christmas Carole. I'd been looking for it for years and lo and behold here it was on Amazon.
331,5019281,4,"I like it. Although it is different than the original Christmas Carol movies, it does depict the older days when times were hard and people struggled to make ends meet."
332,5019281,4,it was a good movie but we still like the old one best.
333,5019281,5,"I saw this as TV movie.
It is very good story based on A Christmas Carol set in Depression era.
Henry Winkler does excellent Acting.
Wonderful Christmas movie."
334,5019281,2,"Marginal, at best."
335,5019281,5,great story and movie
336,5019281,4,Good as it gets for a modern twist to this 1800's tale.
337,5019281,5,"Of all the renditions of a Christmas carol I feel this is thee best. A different approach with the same greedy old man who comes to knowing the true Christmas spirit. I do not regret buying this movie for my father, I have it now."
338,5019281,3,"Well... it's certainly not the original, but, nothing is."
339,5019281,5,great show
340,5019281,3,it was alright
341,5019281,5,Interestingly done in an American setting.
342,5019281,4,"Love the the spirit of the movie, American quality!"
343,5019281,5,Good movie.
344,5019281,4,Different take on a Christmas Carol. Our family enjoyed it.
345,5019281,5,"Henry Winkler does a great job playing Slade.  He is just plan mean and cold hearted.  Rich with nothing to show for it.  Then the usual transformation.

The auction was a new twist adding humor in an un-expected scene.  Winkler ends up being so much fun at the end of the movie making turning it into a comedy.

I'll watch this again."
346,5019281,5,good movie
347,5019281,5,Awesome movies!!! Loved it
348,5019281,4,Henry Winkler did a great job in this American rendition of a classic.
349,5019281,1,Worst rendition of Charles Dickens I have ever seen!  What an abomination!
350,5019281,5,"This Is a Great Holiday Movie,,, Outstanding,,,, Not To Be Miss'ed"
351,5019281,3,ok
352,5019281,5,One of my favorites
353,5019281,5,still love to watch this movie each Christmas season.
354,5019281,5,liked it
355,5019281,5,Great movie!  Henry Winkler does a great job playing a Scrooge like individual.  The rest of the cast are wonderful too!! Don't miss it!!
356,5019281,4,I gave it a 4 just because i love the story of the christmas carol no matter what but i didn't particularly likw the setting and little twists in the story line.
357,5019281,5,I remember watching this as a child and I always loved it.
358,5019281,4,"Engaging remake of a season classic. Winkler does a fine job as the miser, especially since this was done in his younger days! A movie well worth watching."
359,5019281,4,I have to same I am a Christmas Carol addict.  This is a nice twist on the original.
360,5019281,5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE AND ALWAYS HAVE.
361,5019281,5,Good movie
362,5019281,5,"I truly love this movie.. same theme, but set in the depression.  A believable, uplifting, inspirational story!  Henry is wonderful in this."
363,5019281,5,"Wow. Didnt think I'd like this as much as I do! You never think ""The Fonz"" when watching this version of the classic story.  Three quarters through this movie I hated Winklers character!! What a creep!
Excellent movie IMO."
364,5019281,4,I just love the movie
365,5019281,5,I didn't like it when it first came out. But I guess it grows on you.
366,5019281,5,item received excellent order
367,5019281,4,"It's sort of nice that it's not the exact retelling of the classic.  Since it was made for TV, it's a little herky-jerky with the starts and stops which were built in for commercials, but the story is really good."
368,5019281,5,Great for Christmas
369,5019281,4,This early I am so into Christmas shows and this was something to behold Henry Winkler did a great job I enjoyed it very much.
370,5019281,3,"No offense to the performers, because they were good. This just works best with the setting in England."
371,5019281,5,Great spin on a classic!
372,5019281,5,Great Movie!
373,5019281,5,good movie!
374,5019281,1,Did not like at all
375,5019281,1,"This movie was not what I expected, however, it's worth a look (if it's free on Prime). It just wasn't for me man."
376,5019281,5,Love it!!!
377,5019281,4,It was difference and good.
378,5019281,5,"There's only one version of A Christmas Carol that I don't like and I won't mention it here. As someone who collects movies of A Christmas Carol, and reads the book almost every year, I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the portrayal of Scrooge by Henry Winkler. Set in the depression, this American version works very well for the story."
379,5019281,5,I saw this movie decades ago and tracked it down because it tells the entire story of Ebeneezer Scrooge. Felt sorry for him throughout and celebrated hi salvation at the end.
380,5019281,5,I liked Henry winklers version the best.
381,5019281,5,"I watched this on Amazon Prime and immediately bought a copy for my library.  A great modern retelling of Dicken's classic, with Winkler as the lead character--WELL acted.  Loved it!!!  The ending was extra nice; I wasn't expecting it."
382,5019281,5,A great take on Dickens's classic with a twentieth century twist. It shows the range of Henry Winkler's acting ability.
383,5019281,5,Often overlooked for a traditional Christmas movie!
384,5019281,5,Great
385,5019281,5,"Henry Winkler brings an American flavor to Dicken's oft told tale. Set during the Great Depression, this telling of ""A Christmas Carol"", while still the same story of redemption, does it without a nephew and uses current medical problems afflicting ""Tiny Tim"". While purists might not appreciate the Americanization of this classic, anyone who loves this story in any format will thoroughly enjoy this movie."
386,5019281,5,Loved it.
387,5019281,5,"one of the best versions of, a christmas carol."
388,5019281,5,Love this movie
389,5019281,5,this movie was different for him and it was great
390,5019281,5,A great version of the classic story!
391,5019281,4,"The Fonz, who knew... this was a good take on the classic... not a waste of time... You probably know how the story is going to come out, but it is an enjoyable trip, none-the-less..."
392,5019281,5,"I do not understand why this is not shown more than it is a Christmas time.

It is a semi-modern update on the Charles Dickens classic, A Christmas Carol.  Set in the during the depression the story line familiar and the characters refreshed."
393,5019281,5,A version of Christmas Carol.  It's a good story based on the familiar theme with Henry Winkler as the Scrooge character. Some very talented actors were cast and the acting was very good.  If you like Christmas movies you should definitly give this one a try.
394,5019281,4,excellent version
395,5019281,5,One of our favorite Christmas Carol's
396,5019281,5,A great version of the classic
397,5019281,3,A tad hooky but okay.
398,5019281,2,It was merely okay.
399,5019281,5,Thus is a clever way to tell the traditional story. We watch this every Christmas.
400,5019281,4,I had remembered watching this when I was younger and enjoyed it. So I wanted to get and have to watch all the time. My husband and I did enjoy it.
401,5019281,5,Great little known family movie.
402,5019281,2,Terrible
403,5019281,5,Henry Winkler is a better actor than he gets credit for.  He makes a credible American version of Scrooge.
404,5019281,5,Favorite Christmas movie
405,5019281,5,Super acting and great story!
406,5019281,5,I was very happy with my order.
407,5019281,5,Great movie!
408,5019281,4,great for christmas movie
409,5019281,5,Good movie and came on time. Thanks.
410,5019281,5,I love Henry Winkler in this!
411,5019281,4,great rendition of the story
412,5019281,5,Terrific Christmas movie. A new twist to A Christmas Carol
413,5019281,5,Great movie
414,5019281,5,A really good Christmas movie. Of course it's a familiar tale but it is cleverly modernized. The original version with George C Scott is a Christmas tradition with us and this one will be too.
415,5019281,2,"this was not a good edition of the story, all the others are much better."
416,5019281,5,Love it!
417,5019281,5,Great Americanized version of the classic.
418,5019281,5,My sweetie and I swap movies.  Her folks slept through the 80's and mine hated classic movies. She really loved this one of mine and it was even better than I remembered. Clarity was superb and Henry Winkler's interview was great!
419,5019281,4,4 Stars
420,5019281,5,He made me believe that he truly wanted to change at the grave site. I felt his pain.
421,5019281,5,Great remake!  I would like to add this to my own collection of movies.
422,5019281,2,Love the movie but didn't have closed captions.
423,5019281,2,"I am amazed at the high ratings this ripoff of ""A Christmas Carol"" has?  Overall a terrible movie with wooden acting.  If you want a real Christmas movie, watch the real movie and not this cheap imitation."
424,5019281,5,"In this Americanized version of The Charles Dickens classic..which takes place in Concord New Hampshire on Christmas eve,1933..""Ben Slade""(played by Henry Winkler)is an insensitive and greedy time payment holder..who forces the citizens of the small New England village to either pay up their loans or lose all of their items. When they can't pay up..they lose all of their assets and he even fires his assistant""Thatcher""for trying to get his boss to reopen the failed  mill to create new industry and jobs for the unemployed workers. But ""Slade""soon learns the folly of his ways from the ghost of his late partner""Jack Latham""..who tells him that his cruel nature will be the ruin of him and to prevent his soul from being dammed..he must expects the visits of three more ghosts..that night..""Slade""does receive those visitations..and thru the retelling of his past and seeing tragedy of a lonely and sad death..he learns his lesson and although he doesn't became a happier soul like""Scrooge""..He does learn to deal with people in a better way..This film is a wonderful retelling of the Yultide tale and Mr. Winkler gives his best performance ever."
425,5019281,5,From all the Christmas Carol's I watched based on dickens book I liked this the best.  As a boy I watched this on TV and this was not long after Henry Winkler ended his career as the Fonz.  Personally i think he should have made a bigger career as an actor but i assume he may have been type casted and thus shortened his acting future.
426,5019281,5,Great version of A Christmas Carol - we love it. The seller was fantastic - shipping faster than indicated and the price was amazing! Another great addition to our Christmas movie collection.
427,5019281,4,"I'm only docking this version of the Dickens classic one star because Henry Winkler will always be ""the Fonz"" to me, and I still hear the voice of ""the Fonz"" when Winkler delivers his lines as Mr. Slade, an American version of Scrooge from the Herbert Hoover era.  He plays young and old versions of the character, and sounds, to me, especially out of character as the old/new Mr. Slade."
428,5019281,5,"Great version of the classic, it's been a family favorite for many years."
429,5019281,5,"Great movie, Henry  Winkler  did a great job."
430,5019281,5,loved it.
431,5019281,4,"I love this adaptation of the classic tale.  Henry Winkler is, of course, one of my favorite actors.  This is a different slant from the original but it gets the message across none the less.  Well worth the viewing."
432,5019281,5,I loved it
433,5019281,4,Wonderful American version of an old classic!
434,5019281,4,Good movie
435,5019281,5,I always liked Henry Winkler and he did not disappoint. He played a good mean man.... stayed with the original plot for the most part..
436,5019281,5,This is a classic I especially enjoy watching during Christmas.
437,5019281,2,"It started out promising, but it began to drag on and on focusing on too much irrelevant history."
438,5019281,5,"NICE VERSION OF THE TIMELESS DICKENS CLASSIC, WINKLER 'S CHARACTER IS ACTUALLY SCARIER LOOKING THAN THE GHOSTS"
439,5019281,1,Not an American Classic.
440,5019281,5,"This has always been one of my favorites.  It is down to Earth, sad, but not extremely harsh or overly scary to children like other similar movies, and heart-warming.  To me and my family, this is and always will be one of our favorites of the holiday."
441,5019281,5,Another perspective of the original  A Christmas Carol.
442,5019281,5,Loved this movie! Henry Winkler made me cry when he became so lighthearted after his experiences with the 3 spirits.  A must watch every year!
443,5019281,5,This is a great movie. It's a twist on a classic of scrooge.
444,5019281,2,"An unusual take on "" A Christmas Carol.""  This movie takes place in New Hampshire in the early 20TH century. It is a made for tv movie on a very low budget.  It has some good parts and the acting is not bad, but Henry Winklers' make up is very badly done, when he made this movie he was in his late 40's and he plays an old Scoroge, in this case Slade.in his 80's. Interesting but I would not recommend it."
445,5019281,5,Old classic but done very well.  I remember seeing this some time ago and felt it was well worth the view.
446,5019281,5,Nice twist to a great classic story
447,5019281,5,I have seen this several times and enjoyed it more each time. Highly recommended!
448,5019281,5,Very good quality. ..
449,5019281,5,One Christmas Special the networks should show every year.
450,5019281,4,It's good.  But it's hard to beat the original:)
451,5019281,4,Very good..
452,5019281,5,Great movie based on the classic story. Well acted and well developed.
453,5019281,4,Slow moving but a great twist on Dickens.  Henry does a fantastic job.
454,5019281,4,Different than the original but still good
455,5019281,3,"Cute, but not as good as original."
456,5019281,5,This is a really good take on the original A Christmas Carol. I liked this version and Henry Winkler does a fine job!!!
457,5019281,5,love
458,5019281,5,"Some times it is better to leave memories where they are, lol. Although I remember great memories watching this movie and how it was the best of them all, many decades have passed and I was no longer able to locate this version and the TV stations did not broadcast where I get. When I found this here I was delighted and couldn't wait till I received it in the mail..
Not as good as a story as it once rolled around in the mind of a young person who liked the Fonz, haha. Oh well it reminded me of old happy times. That is worth as many stars as I can give."
459,5019281,5,"I always a fan of Henery Winkler. He's was great in this movie. I enjoyed it. I recommend to my friends, co worker and family"
460,5019281,5,This as been a favorite of mine since I saw it on TV years ago.  I shared it with friends this Christmas and all enjoyed this version.  I watch it every year
461,5019281,5,Great experience.
462,5019281,5,My children grandchildren and I love this movie .  It is a great family movie.
463,5019281,5,Greatest version of this classic story by Charles Dickens! It is a must watch for Christmas!
464,5019281,5,I really like this movie. I like Henry Winkler!!
465,5019281,5,Great twist on original
466,5019281,5,"This is a great alternative to A Christmas Carol/Scrooge.  It is a twist on the original, but still a very enjoyable Christmas movie.  Henry Winkler is great as the lead character.  He plays an elderly miser very well."
467,5019281,5,I love the Christmas Carol story and have several versions on DVD. I like this story as it is set in America and a unique story.
468,5019281,5,As advertised. Very nice. An easy and problem free transaction. Thank you.
469,5019281,5,"Always enjoyed the standard ""Christmas Story.  Saw this one on TV a long time ago and was excited to find it was available on DVD. Enjoyed it completely."
470,5019281,5,So excited to have found this on dvd.
471,5019281,5,Very enjoyable Christmas movie!
472,5019281,5,Great Christmas story
473,5019281,5,Great DVD
474,5019281,5,NICE TWIST TO THE ORIGINAL
475,5019281,5,Best Christmas movie ever! Great quality.
476,5019281,1,Henry Winkler is a bad actor and has never had much talent.
477,5019281,5,One of the best Christmas movies ever.
478,5019281,5,great twist on an old classic
479,5019281,5,This was a great movie and I was so happy to find it on DVD!!! Very happy with this movie!!
480,5019281,5,gift. Loved it!
481,5019281,5,A classic.
482,5019281,5,"Henry Winkler is great as a ""Scrooge""."
483,5019281,5,Nice
484,5019281,5,Love it
485,5019281,5,Great movie!
486,5019281,4,"This is a different spin on the classic ""The Christmas Carol"".  It is nice, and you might want to add it to you Christmas collection."
487,5019281,5,I was excited when this movie came out.  We waited years to have a copy.
488,5019281,4,B+ story but the DVD worked fine.
489,5019281,5,Love anything to do with a Christmas carol. Henry Winkler is excellent great telling hard to find excellent condition. Really enjoy it!  A little different telling but same result.
490,5019281,5,"My favorite Christmas movie.  A great revisit of the the Dickens' classic ""A Christmas Carol"" with a twist.  Henry Winkler is great in this movie."
491,5019281,4,"Very nice adaptation of Charles Dickens ""A Christmas Carol"".  Wasn't the greatest, but nothing can compare with the original script."
492,5019281,5,Great classic XMas movie
493,5019281,5,"Oldie, but a goodie"
494,5019281,5,great acting
495,5019281,5,Great movie
496,5019281,5,"This is an excellent adaptation set during the American Depression era and in New England, highly recommended!  I actually perform Dickens' Christmas Carol and have seen various adaptations, and this one does justice to the essential messages of generosity and especially personal transformation!"
497,5019281,3,"GOOD, BUT NOT THE ALL TIME CLASSIC"
498,5019281,5,This is an enjoyable adaptation of the Dickens' classic.  I don't know why it was never shown again on television.
499,5019281,3,"My boyfriend had fond memories of this from his childhood so we rented it. Meh...it wasn't bad but given the number of versions of A Christmas Carol that are out there, this ranks pretty low. Henry Winkler gave a wobbly and not very believable version of an American Scrooge, rather like a high school boy playing an old man, and the conversion of the story from England to America felt sort of forced. It just seemed very dated to me.

I can't see it ever becoming a ""classic"" version of this story, but if your curious to see The Fonz in a very different role, here it is."
500,5019281,5,Great movie with Winkler and a new twist on the old story.
501,5019281,5,My favorite Christmas movie ever
502,5019281,1,The movie came with no sound
503,5019281,5,Great Movie and Great on time Delivery
504,5019281,5,A very good American rendition of the Christmas Carol story.  The entire cast presents a great family movie to view during the holiday season.  This is a keeper!
505,5019281,5,Great update to a holiday favorite.
506,5019281,5,It was brand new still wrapped I watched it right away! I like this version!
507,5019281,5,"Well-cast, wonderfully told version of ""A Christmas Carol"".  I watch this at least 10 times each Christmas season."
508,5019281,5,I enjoyed this movie very much.
509,5019281,2,BORING !!
510,5019281,4,"I love the Dickens' tale ""A Christmas Carol,"" and this relatively modern version is an excellent adaptation."
511,5019281,5,Incredible movie -nice to see a moderized version of a classic story.
512,5019281,5,Great version of a Xmas carol with a more updated theme.
513,5019281,4,"This item was exactly what I was hoping for. However, there was one glitch in the recording."
514,5019281,5,Henry Winkler is beyond belief!  This movie should be on TV every Christmas!
515,5019281,5,This is one of my favorite 'Christmas Carol' movies.
516,5019281,5,Good working order
517,5019281,3,"Just ok.

  DT"
518,5019281,5,Great movie
519,5019281,5,watched it for Christmas thought it was excellent glad I bought it.
520,5019281,5,"My husband remembered this movie from years ago and said he really liked it. So we rented it one night with our three teens. We weren't sure what to expect but we all loved this movie. It's another version of ""A Christmas Carol"" and very well done. If you're looking for a good Christmas movie, definitely watch it."
521,5019281,3,The story fell a bit flat with my students after reading the original.
522,5019281,5,Excellent
523,5019281,4,This is a favorite of my husband. We both enjoyed it.
524,5019281,5,Good version of an old classic.
525,5019281,5,i like it a lot
526,5019281,5,Played great and didn't take Long to get here!
527,5019281,5,Love Fonzie in this
528,5019281,3,Awesome movie
529,5019281,5,I love just about any movie that has to do with The Christmas Carol. I can now add this one to the list.
530,5019281,5,"Absolute classic.  Hard to believe the ""Fonz"" could be so natural in the lead.  The twist on the DIckens version is that this takes place in 1920's New Hampshire.  Its one to watch every year.  Too bad there isn't a remastered or enhanced version available.  Its 4:3 and obviously direct from the TV tapes.  Dont let that stop you from watching or buying it though!"
531,5019281,5,Packaged well and a very enjoyable movie.
532,5019281,4,One of the best Scrooge movies. Henry Winkler does a good acting job playing Scrooge.
533,5019281,5,One of the best versions of this story ever.
534,5019281,3,"Good spin on a classic story, just a little slow and definitely a made for TV movie."
535,5019281,4,Good movie but not my favorite.
536,5019281,5,"We loved this old classic.  Can't believe we haven't seen this particular movie before.  Great family view, I'd certainly recommend it."
537,5019281,3,"A movie with some cute moments, a big nod to the inspiration/source material, and nice setting... Unfortunately, the only thing holding this movie back was.... Henry Winkler.

The Fonz makes an awful Scrooge, or Slade, in this case. His acting isn't horrible, but it's also not that good. There seems very little emotion in his transition from corrupt, hateful, ""covetous old sinner"" to changed man, learning to care for others. He's stiff and seemingly insincere. (His interaction with the young boy at the end is a little creepy too. ""You're going to come for a ride with me."" Ew.)

His character is too old looking... it looks like he could kick the bucket any moment (yet he runs around like a man quite a bit younger), and caused a disconnect and confusion while visiting with The Ghost of Christmas Past.

I mean, it's not horrible, but I certainly didn't like it as much as many of the other Christmas Carol adaptations out there.

If you're looking to watch A Christmas Carol, I recommend the George C. Scott version for a wonderfully sarcastic Ghost of Christmas Present who gives Scrooge a good dose of his own medicine (however, the scene with Ignorance and Want may be scary to children*), or A Muppet Christmas Carol for a surprisingly touching musical adaptation- I promise the songs aren't too hokey. And the literature, narrated by Gonzo, is very close to the source material (very family friendly).

*They appear near the end of the Ghost of Christmas Present's time, while Scrooge witnesses the struggle of a homeless family (the spirit keeps Ignorance and Want under his robe)."
538,5019281,5,Excellent all around!
539,5019281,3,Just okay
540,5019281,5,Favorite version of the Christmas Carol
541,5019281,4,I love this version of the christmas carol...
542,5019281,5,Item as promised. Fast shipping.
543,5019281,5,Great
544,5019281,5,Great!
545,5019281,5,an excellent christmas movie. quite a delight.
546,5019281,1,"Terrible version of this movie, poor acting! And I love Henry winkler ! I donated this movie"
547,5019281,5,"An updated superior version of a classic which has to be THE most underrated christmas classic.  Winkler, as another reviewer posted, really demonstrates his incredible acting ability."
548,5019281,5,"Great American Version of Charles Dickens ""A Christmas Carol"". Excellent ensemble acting!  A must to watch every holiday season!"
549,5019281,5,great version of the traditional story!
550,5019281,5,"I have been looking for this movie for years love it, watched it right away. Just as good as I remembered"
551,5019281,5,"I remember this version as a child and actually searched for it to share with my family! Henry Winkler is amazing and gave me awhole new view of 'the Fonz"" as a gifted actor. Don't discount this adaptation because he is in it, BUY it because he IS IN IT! It is well worth your time and money!"
552,5019281,5,This is a very good movie. Henry Winker is excellent.  It is touching and will warm your heart for Christmas.
553,5019281,5,Received almost immediately in excellent condition. A heart-warming and wholly-watchable adaptation of the original classic...
554,5019281,5,Love this movie. Watch it every year.
555,5019281,5,ive looked for this for a long time and i wasn't  disappointed . good buy .
556,5019281,5,Classic
557,5019281,5,"I saw this movie in 1979 and immediately bought the VHS version which was all that was available at the time.

I'm a Vietnam Vet of the Tet Offensive of February 1968 out of Saigon, Vietnam.  I retired from the U.S. Army as an E8/Master Sergeant on 1 April 2007, after a total of 27 years of service.

This is one of your top five performances as an actor if not your best.

Keep up the good work and ""Wish You All The Best That Life Can Bring""."
558,5019281,5,A must to own for you Christmas collection.  Henry Winkler is amazing in this uptake of Scrooge.
559,5019281,5,This is a great movie.
560,5019281,4,well played byHenry Winklerand.  Definitely one of the better different takes and remakes of a classic
561,5019281,3,Made for TV movie; not awful; snowy afternoon with nothing else to do kind of film.
562,5019281,5,A great acting job of Henry Winker. Good take on The Christmas Carol with an American view.
563,5019281,5,"I do. I like every well made version I have seen.
This one, in my opinion is the best.
Without spoiling anything for you, here is why.
The setting is in a small New Hampshire town.
It is the tail end of the great depression.
We, in the USA, can relate to this as, know it or not, it has greatly influenced todays society.

Our grandparents  were very thrifty throughout their lives as a result of these hard times.
Then, many of their children, as adults did a complete turnaround when it comes to spending, credit, and unknowingly influenced this me me me society we now witness. So now, maybe more than in Dickens' time, we can benefit from such a lesson.

More important, in my opinion, is the detail the writer used when the ghost of past showed Slade of his childhood as well as the detail of Slade's reaction at the end.
This big tough guy's eyes well up everytime I watch it.

As a couple others said, I stumbled on this movie on TV. Mid 1990's .TBS?  Quickly put in a vhs tape to record. Later,  with software, switched all my tapes to DVD.
This one, on switching, the last minute or two were destroyed.  Plus, the fact that I didn't record the very beginning and the way networks edit out several minutes to cram extra commercials, I am so looking forward to seeing, for the first time, the entire movie.

IN BLUERAY NO LESS. PSYCH!!"
564,5019281,5,"well well well, lots of talent here"
565,5019281,5,"A great remake of Charles Dickens' - ""A Christmas Carol""! Additional Fact: I wish the lines of.the novie were sub-titled!
63x927is58401"
566,5019281,3,my mother and father were happy to own this movie
567,5019281,5,Love this movie
568,5019281,5,Great buy thanks!
569,5019281,5,"One of the better remakes of A Christmas Carol, plus Henry Winkler does the part justice.  He is very believable in this roll."
570,5019281,5,Amazing. Gives a whole new view.
571,5019281,5,i am very happy with this dvd
572,5019281,5,I have the VHS.  Wanted the DVD.  One of my favorite Christmas movies.
573,5019281,5,good copy
574,5019281,5,Classic
575,5019281,5,WAS OF MY BEST CHRISTMAS SHOES AND OH YES HENRY WINKLER
576,5019281,5,great story
577,5019281,5,"The best filmed version of A Christmas Carol I've ever seen.  Henry Winkler is brilliant.  Many times, I've given this film as a Christmas gift to an entire family - and it is always well received by young and old.  One of my favorite scenes is when Scrooge is about to see his first ghost - can feel a haunting approaching - and is looking for an intruder among all the belongings he has repossessed from people unable to keep up on the payments.  There is a malice in his action and it makes the belongings look haunted.  Really effective."
578,5019281,5,Great
579,5019281,5,A must have for anyone who loves the Charles Dickens original. A great holiday movie for the family.
580,5019281,5,"This movie was a 1979 TV special that we watched and really enjoyed when it first aired. Henry Winkler starred as Benedict Slade (""Scrooge""), and the movie was set in Concord, New Hampshire during the Depression era.  Unfortunately, it was only broadcast a few times over the following years. It never became an annual Christmas classic like other Christmas movies.  It was available on VHS tape for a few years, but these tapes went out of production, and became hard to find, and thus expensive when found. The movie did not immediately become available on DVD, as I looked for it over the years. When we found the Blue Ray on Amazon while looking for other Christmas titles last Christmas (2013), we bought it!"
581,5019281,4,I remember watching this as a kid on prime time television.  I love this unique version of a Christmas Carol.
582,5019281,5,Best performance ever
583,5019281,5,"I have always loved this version of A Christmas Carol, but the quality was always poor.  If you can get this on blu-ray, I recommend that.  This is a great movie, though."
584,5019281,5,Really a unique twist on a classic.  Loved this movie since I was a kid.  Great to have it in my collection!
585,5019281,5,I enjoyed this movie because it was much easier to relate to than the original English classic version.  I had watched parts of it on TV many years ago.
586,5019281,5,"I received the dvd in perfect condition and relatively quick.  The seller delivered as promised!

If you're a fan of Chrismas Carol movies, this one is a good one to have in your collection.  It's a bit different than the traditional version, but ALL versions are the ""same but different"".  I highly recommend this one!"
587,5019281,5,I love the Dickens story and this is a Depression-era take on that classic. Winkler is very good as the cranky Mr. Scrooge.
588,5019281,3,I really can't complain about the shopping experience; that was great.  I loved this movie when I originally saw it but like so many things in life it wasn't so good the second time.
589,5019281,5,I always loved this version of a Christmas Carol. It's quite well done and original. A nice diversion from the standard fare. Winkler is wonderful.
590,5019281,5,"Henry Winkler is a fine actor and this version of the famous story is proof positive. He does and excellent job as Ebeneezer Scrooge. The story, of course, is the same as the other versions, but each remake brings a different interpretation by the actors and writers. This one is fun and easy to watch. A fine family film."
591,5019281,4,"I am a big fan of Dickens and love ""A Christmas Carol"".  I have a collection of most versions.  This is not the Alistair Sims classic but is well done in a U.S. depression era setting."
592,5019281,5,"This was one of my favorite holiday movies as a kid.  Although it is tailored after Charles Dickens Christmas Carol, this movie has some distinct differences which actually make it stand on its own merit.  I love the regular story of Christmas Carol, but this is refreshingly different and a must see."
593,5019281,5,"An American Christmas Carol...based on the classic by Charles Dickens, ""A Christmas Carol."" Now that I've written something, you need to cut down the word number requirement. That's really stupid."
594,5019281,4,HENRY WINKLER DOES A GOOD JOB PUTTING AN AMERICAN SPIN ON SCROOGE. I NEVER THOUGHT FONZE COULD PULL IT OFF BUT HE DID A FINE JOB.  MAYBE NOT ACADEMY AWARD MATERIAL BUT VERY ENJOYABLE.
595,5019281,5,"If you want to start a wonderful family tradition, then you should buy this video.  This is the American version of a Christmas Carol with Henry Winkler.  It is a wonderful movie that 3 generations in our family has enjoyed.  The movie arrived quickly and was packaged carefully.  Good Service and a Great Movie"
596,5019281,5,"While this is the Dickens classic played sideways, there is a great freshness in the re-telling. Henry Winkler is his phenomenal self and I promise you will watch this every year."
597,5019281,5,"Henry Winkler plays a great part in this movie, brings it to life! Good modern version of Scrooge! Don't miss this classic"
598,5019281,5,"One of the best renditions of a holiday favorite.  Henry Winkler at his best, with a marvelous supporting cast.  Very touching."
599,5019281,5,Great unless you are just tired of Christmas movies along Charles Dickens Christmas Carol theme.  It is certainly one of the better ones based on Dickens book and had been unavailable for purchase for to many years
600,5019281,5,"This is my favorite Christmas Carol movie. I have waited for it to come out, and when I finally looked it up again, I bought it!"
601,5019281,5,"Even though i don't care for Henry Winklers  acting i liked this movie it fit him real good Thanks
Dale"
602,5019281,5,This is one of my husbands favorite xmas movies and we only had it on VHS....so I was thrilled to see it available on a DVD & at a great price! Was delivered quickly and we could enjoy it as we decorated!
603,5019281,5,My wife and I loved seeing this movie.  Both of us have childhood memories of this movie and it was great to curl up on the couch and watch.
604,5019281,5,I had been searching for this DVD for over a year. Im not sure if it was out of print or just not available but I finally found it thru Amazon. I love this remake ever since it came out in the 70s and thrilled to finally have it in my collection
605,5019281,5,"I really enjoy all the ""Christmas Carol-Scrooge"" movies. I own all the ones I know about and watch them each year. I want to add this one to my collection as it is a different take on the traditional ones."
606,5019281,5,"I saw this version of a Christmas Carol years ago and it left quite an impression on me. There are many versions of this story, but very few that really capture the story well. This is one of those. If you've never seen it, you must!"
607,5019281,4,Anorher good movie for holiday watchers..a little twist from the ordinary scrooge movie. Enjoyable. What couldn't you like from the fons.
608,5019281,4,"It is pretty much the traditional Scrooge story, but set in America in about 1880.  It does give a twist to it to help Americans tie the story into a scene in their history."
609,5019281,5,"This timeless story is relevant to today's economic times. This movie is as valuable as any modern-day teachings I've read within the context of ""how to be a better person, live well, and do it right in the new year"". There are old fashion morals that America would do well in revisiting. Kids and young adults alike will find a new perspective on everyday life challenges. Everyone will gain a better attitude after viewing this one.
Anyone who purchases this movie will not be disappointed.
Henry Winkler; who doesn't enjoy his workmanship?"
610,5019281,4,Good performance by Henry Winkler of a crotchety old man despite being very young when this movie was made. We enjoyed the story.
611,5019281,4,"I thought the cast and acting was very good, and the variation on the old familiar plot was done well and interesting."
612,5019281,4,"This remake of the Dickens original is effective and realistic portrayal of life during the depression, and it is fun ot watch Henry Winkler in the lead role."
613,5019281,5,"Fantastic American twist of the classic ""A Christmas Carol"". It brings things closer to home with all the essence of the original classic"
614,5019281,5,"I had a copy of the original DVD but ufortunately ""loaned"" it out. (NEVER A LENDER BE) and it never made it back home. I was peased to see this offered because I was not even seeing used ones on line. The Winkler interview is a great addition."
615,5019281,5,This is an excellent version of the Dickens classic.  You should see it.  This was bought as a gift for my wife and she loves it.  It came in great shape and shipping was FAST!
616,5019281,5,I thought his was a great twist on A Christmas Carol that put it in a more relevant perspective for these times
617,5019281,5,this is my favorite movie of all the christmas carols.  Now I can watch it any time I want to and don't have to wait for the season.
618,5019281,5,"Hard to find in a Christmas line up and worth the watching.  Forget he was ""The Fonz"".  This is well done."
619,5019281,2,Another entry in the retelling of the classic.  Ho hum from start to finish.  Henry Winkler is not believable as a Scrooge type.
620,5019281,4,"Nice drama- based on the original Christmas Carol movie.  This version stars Henry Winkler as Scrooge and takes place during the Depression in America.  Winkler plays Scrooge as a business owner who offers home furnishings to be paid off over time.  But most people can,t pay off the entire bill due to job scarcity - etc- and Winkler ends up repossessing much of what he has ""sold"".  Soon ""ghosts""- ( passed aquaintances in this version)- of Chistmas past, present, and future appear taking Winkler back through time and into the future showing him his past and what the future holds in store for one of his ""value system"" ,  Winkler realizes that he best become more kinder and more considerate of the needs of his town neighbors or risk dying a lonely and embittered man.  Dramatic with poignant scenes.  Held my attention throughout!"
621,5019281,5,Have been looking for the Henry Winkler 'An American Christmas Carol'.  This is a different take on the movie.  Order and enjoy!
622,5019281,5,It has been years since I first saw this version of a Christmas Carol. I had remarked to my daughter that I would like to see the Christmas Carol version with Henry Winkler one day when we were discussing all the different versions. I was glad I was able to watch and enjoy it again.
623,5019281,5,Good fun movie for the holidays nice different version of A Christmas Carol like the characters but it could have been longer
624,5019281,4,Winkler does a little over-the-top in his role as the scrooge character and the production values leave somewhat more to be desired but all-in-all a nice rendition for holiday viewing.
625,5019281,4,This particular version offered a different view of the classic tale and was well worth watching.  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
626,5019281,5,This is a great version of the old classic. It stays with the original storyline and Henry Winkler does his usual outstanding performance. A definite movie to watch over again next Christmas season.
627,5019281,4,"I liked Mr Winklers pertrayal of a depression error Ebineser. He played the part of promising, driven young man, to unmoraled business man, to kind hearted senior citizen quite well. It was not a big Holywood production. But for a made for TV Movie it was quite good."
628,5019281,5,I love An American Christmas Carol with Henry Winkler.  In my opinion it is the very best version of Scrooge.  Hope everyone sees it and enjoys it as much as I do.
629,5019281,5,New version of how life review can cause one to adjust their life so that they start living a life of service instead of a life of materialism.
630,5019281,5,"Great American Versions of the Dickens's Classic.
Enjoyed it very much This video is worth buying.
It has a modern view of a ""Christmas Carol""."
631,5019281,5,"Evry year at Christmas we watch this movie , it's an American Classic . Henry Winkler is fantastic . Our 22 year old daughter had never seen it before and she said it was excellent ."
632,5019281,5,Henry Winkler does a wonderful job with this version of the classic Christmas Carol story. It is a movie for the whole family. Take time to watch it.
633,5019281,3,"Too many good originals available to spend time watching this movie.  I didn't like Henry Winkler at all in the 'Scrooge' role.
I thought his acting was substandard."
634,5019281,5,Great movie. I wish you would include more of the old TV Christmas shows for purchase. Excellent quality of viewing and pleasant movie.
635,5019281,4,"Good cast, stays pretty close to the original story, entertaining, I would watch it again, next year, year, year, year."
636,5019281,4,I remember watching it on TV many years ago and enjoying it then.  Just wanted to relive that time and I was not disappointed.
637,5019281,3,"This is a novel and entertaining take on the Dicken's classic.  The ""Fonz"" gives an admirable performance.  I will watch again."
638,5019281,4,An updated version of A Christmas Carol that doesn't lose any of the important stuff. Great movie for the family.
639,5019281,4,"Trying to make Dickens relevant again, this dresses him up in American hard times and values. Winkler is always a pleasure to watch. I don't know, however, how Winkler would have Dickens speak if set in post-2007 American, though."
640,5019281,3,"Blu-ray disc is digitally remastered and is 1080p however the format is ""1.33:1""!!! It is after all a made for TV movie. Sorry but you expect ""1.85:1""  on Blu-ray. None of the other reviews or descriptions advise you of the format.
Had I known this I would not have ordered it on Blu-ray. I did and it's not that important to return it within the 30 days as it does add to my Scrooge collection.
I will not prattle on about A Christmas Carol. Three ghosts transforming a curmudgeon on Christmas Eve. You love or hate it, Enough said!"
641,5019281,5,Nice interpretation of a classis! Love Henry Winkler as the Scrooge character.i just love the moral of keeping Christmas 365 days a tear:)
642,5019281,5,"Doesn't matter the time or the place we are in life, we should always look at ourselves and reflect on how we can make a difference in our world."
643,5019281,5,"I don't think any movie will be as good as the Alastair Sims version. But this one, which takes place during the depression, is nevertheless excellent. Henry Winkler is an excellent, more modern Mr. Scrooge."
644,5019281,4,"It is a different take, but the message remains the same. Winkler does a surprisingly good job! I recommend it!"
645,5019281,4,This is a cute adaptation of the classic Scrooge story. Henry Winkler comes off as even meaner than the original Scrooge as portrayed in the earlier versions.
646,5019281,5,"I thought the movie was great when it came out in 1979 and still think it's great today. This is a good movie for the whole family to watch; however, not sure if the kids of today would appreciate it."
647,5019281,5,I got this for a person who has it on vhs and needed it replaced. They wanted to keep it in there collection. Thank you for the promptness of receiving it.
648,5019281,3,It didn't grab our attention enough to finish it.  It was probably okay if it was the first Christmas movie you watched this season.
649,5019281,3,Good made for TV movie.  The makeup on Henry Winkler is not too good. Good interpretation of an old story.
650,5019281,3,This movie is definitely a knock off of a Christmas Carol.  This version is Americanized.  It was ok but to a ground breaker.
651,5019281,5,my family really enjoyed this movie. hoping to find the dvd in stores someday. might have to order on line. thanks for the choice of classic shows.
652,5019281,5,"I found this film to be just as uplifting as the classic ""Christmas Carol"".  Henry Winkler gave a sterling performance as the cold and indifferent ""Scroogelike"" character."
653,5019281,4,"I got this for my father in law for Christmas, because he has been asking for it forever.  The day before it arrived (on schedule), he had a retirement party at work, and wouldn't you know, somebody there gave him this movie as a going away gift!! This is the only reason why I am going to send this back.  It is packaged well, shipped on time, and I have no problems with it other than someone else beat me to giving it as a gift first!!"
654,5019281,3,"Don't get me wrong, Winkler is a wonderful character actor and I would rate 95% of his performances as B+ or A, however, he was not very convincing in the starring role of ""An American Christmas Carol.""  I'd give it a C or C+ at best.  Ayyyyy!"
655,5019281,5,I collect all the (non-musical) versions of this story. This one is not seen often on TV. I watch it every Christmas. Good updated (1930's) version of the Dickens classic. TRY IT!! DVD has played well with no problems.
656,5019281,3,It was good but not as emotionally moving as the the Christmas Carol by Dickens  I like Christmas movies that make me sigh
657,5019281,4,This is a good adaptation of Scrooge. Set during the American depression. Henry Winkler Makes a convincing scrooge in this movie.
658,5019281,3,"I'm not a big fan of ""aging"" people to play a role but overall it's not a bad storyline. It's a nice version of a familiar theme."
659,5019281,3,This movie is ok.  I love the middle of the movie.  The three spirits could have brought more action. Nice
660,5019281,3,Wasn't my favorite version but I still enjoyed it.  I didn't particularly care for Henry Winkler makeup . Wasn't very real looking.
661,5019281,5,It seems like just about everybody has made a Christmas Carol movie.  This one is the best by far!  It seems more realistic than all the others and the time period seems to be perfect.  The acting is also far better than any of the others I've seen; my opinion.
662,5019281,5,"I always liked Henry Winkler in Happy Days and I believe he did a wonderful performance in An American Christmas Carol.  The move, while based on others like it had its own twists and special touches.  It is what my family would call, ""a keeper""."
663,5019281,1,"Horrible movie.  Why Henry Winkler.........why?  The make up was terrible the sets were subpar.....I get it was '80s made for TV, but it brought our evening down fast.  Love the Winkler....no likely this movie.."
664,5019281,4,I liked this production giving the possible American point of view.  We've all seen the original Christmas Carol but I'd highly recommend this to anyone.  We watched this with our grandchildren whose interest was kept the entire length.
665,5019281,3,The whole story does not develop well. No big set up of a grouchy Scrooge character. No big transformation. Weak all around.
666,5019281,5,"haven't been able to find this out in the world.  i really like this version and want to share it with my girls. found it here, yay!!!!!!!"
667,5019281,5,A well done version of the story based in America.  Henry Winkler does an impressive Scrooge and pace of the film and visuals are fantastic.
668,5019281,4,"This was an interesting take on the old ""Christmas Carol"" movies inspired by Dickens novel.  My husband loved it.  It is about people in the  depression era and it was interesting to see the scenery, clothes and furniture, etc.  The acting was very good, too."
669,5019281,5,"I wasn't expecting too much from this film, but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the production and acting!  Henry Winkler (famous for playing ""the Fonz"" on Happy Days) proves his acting abilities and range of emotions in this satisfying film.  Some unexpected twists and just enough grit to make it evocative of Depression Era America make this a nice take on the Christmas classic.  (P.S.  Just wait for the Ghost of Christmas Futureso wouldn't think that would work out well, but it did!!!  That's all I'm saying. Love it.)"
670,5019281,4,always enjoy the Christmas carol movies. this makes our 6th one. Henry WInkler put a new twist on it for su re
671,5019281,5,"Ignore some of the more negative reviews on here. This made for TV movie really touches me every time I watch it; which is every Christmas.

The acting is splendid and the story is well written. It is suitable for the entire family and it gives a good picture of the depression era of our country."
672,5019281,5,Henry Winkler as Slade was great. Good cast and I enjoyed the movie very much.  I am adding it to my list of favorite holiday movies.
673,5019281,4,This was a movie from my youth that I would watch every year. I just love it. I am a Charles Dicken fan.
674,5019281,4,"excellent movie
Worth seeing. Inspiring adaptation of the Dickens book.
I saw this free on prime and it was great"
675,5019281,5,"This is another movie on my ""watch this one every Christmas"" list. A ""feel good"" movie to feel good about."
676,5019281,5,"Next to the ""A Christmas Carol"" with Reginald Owen, this one should also be in your collection.  Can not go wrong having this movie."
677,5019281,5,This is hardly ever on TV and thankfully found on Prime. This movie captures the 30's as well as Dickens' Christmas Carol
678,5019281,5,Henry Winkler's performance was outstanding!  Different slant on time honored favorite Christmas story.  Plan to purchase for our holiday movie collection.
679,5019281,5,"I enjoyed Winkler, well done and interesting throughout.  I must have missed this when it first came out so glad Amazon offered it!"
680,5019281,5,"All I can say is watch it and judge for yourselves.  I used to live in Concord, and it is not truly historically accurate. though there does appear to be a genuine Concord Coach in Slade's barn and there is indeed still a granite  quarry."
681,5019281,5,I give this 4 stars because you mix Henry Winkler with Christmas and you have the best Scrooge movie ever!
682,5019281,5,This is a great Christmas Classic.  My husband introduced me to it years ago and it's our favorite hoilday movie.  Henry Winkler does a great job.  Definitely recommend.
683,5019281,2,this movie just did not live up to the expectations of other Christmas Carol movies.... it seem contrived and was not very well put together
684,5019281,4,This is one of the best Scrooge movies out.  Henry Winkler outdoes himself.  The casting is excellent and the music and theme old but very relevant.
685,5019281,5,"great  movie  i  recommend  to  all  christmas  ,  with  family cildrens  for  all  and  friends  close  friends  .merry  christmas and"
686,5019281,5,"The first time I saw ""An American Christmas Carol"" I immediately fell in love with it.  I didn't grow up during the Great Depression but my father did and he told stories that made it real for me.  This re-imagination of an Americanized Scrooge during the Depression is wonderful.  The story, acting, directing, camera work, costumes, sets, locations, music, and all production values are great.  I have always enjoyed Henry Winkler as an actor, but I think this is by far one of his best if not the best performance of his career to date.  I highly recommend it for the whole family.

CA Luster"
687,5019281,3,This was an interesting twist on the English version.  Love Henry Winkler!  No Bah Humbug here!  An enjoyable family film.
688,5019281,4,It's so funny to me that this was made at the height of Henry's Fonz days. It was surprisingly charming and brought me back to the days of my childhood Christmas TV shows.
689,5019281,3,It was pretty good. It takes the classic Christmas carol set originally in London and brings it to America.  Henry Winkler does a good Scrooge character
690,5019281,5,"The small historic Canadian town of Elora, with its many century-old buildings, is the perfect setting for this story, set in the early 1900's.  Bringing the story to 20th century America allows the story to incorporate situations Americans can more easily with.  Henry Winkler does a great job of recreating the Scrooge character, and the supporting cast are no less admirable.  This is an annual ""must watch"" story for me."
691,5019281,4,"A good example of American history and an interesting interpretation of the Dicken's story. Well told, I enjoyed it immensely."
692,5019281,4,Set in the USA about the time of the depression it is an update of that old familiar story of redemption.  The story is classic and this one is as good as all the rest.  Henry Winkler is good in this role.
693,5019281,5,This is one of my fav versions....set during the Depression in America. It's unique regarding Scrooge's upbringing in an orphanage (when he repossess the orphanage's piano on  Christmas Eve!)
694,5019281,5,"I have always loved the Christmas Carol, and this version doesn't disappoint. Henry Winkler plays a great ""Scrooge"". I loved it!"
695,5019281,5,"I thought that this movie was great it had a different twist on the classic, I would watch this movie again"
696,5019281,5,"Great, wholesome family movie with a great message. Fabulous acting as well. We will watch again with our young kids."
697,5019281,3,Not the best acting. The story is a classic so I watched it. The 1951 A Christmas Carol version with Alastair Sims is the best. Or the George C Scott one isn't bad either.
698,5019281,5,One of the better Christmas movies made.  Henry Winkler plays a superb role.  Really enjoy the different slant on the old Charles Dickens movie.
699,5019281,4,"Very well done, Henry Winkler is a smooth guy. Close to the original story line, so is fun to watch from an American perspective."
700,5019281,4,"Good remake of Christmas Carol with relatively few twists.  Set during the great depression in the U.S. Henry Winkler is generally good, but gives a few too many Fonzi looks for me."
701,5019281,4,This was a pretty good movie!  Henry Winkler was a pleasure to watch.  I wasn't sure if I would like it but I enjoyed this movie very much!
702,5019281,5,"I saw this for the first time in the 80s and liked the ""American"" twist on the Charles Dickens' classic. I love this story in all versions, as the first version for me was Mr. Magoo!!"
703,5019281,2,I didn't find this version of the classic very moving or interesting.  The original Christmas Carol was so much better.
704,5019281,4,"Remakes of classic films are often terrible, but Winkler is memorable in this remake of Dickens' classic tale. I saw it once on TV years ago and have been looking for it ever since. Voila! on Amazon. If you like a good Christmas story--even if you already know the ending--this one is fun and heartwarming."
705,5019281,3,Nice rendition on classic movie.  Henry Winkler does a good job of playing a Scrooge type character.  Worth seeing this time of year.
706,5019281,5,Saw this one on TV years ago and have looked for it for years.  I was delighted to see it on DVD now.  Watched it right after it arrived and loved it still.  Henry Winkler is great.
707,5019281,5,"We watch this every year, as well as the original story with George C. Scott....good contrast in stories and wonderful treats."
708,5019281,5,"This is Charles Dickens' classic Christmas Carol with an American twist.  This version does a nice job of capturing the consequences of history and one's personal role in it.  It provides a sobering view of the main character's choices, just as the original, ""A Christmas Carol,"" did but this version also shows how one man's choices affect those around him.  I recommend this film to anyone who collects different versions of, ""A Christmas Carol."""
709,5019281,5,A good Christmas carol dhenry winkler one during the depression. Henry winkler does a good job.a classic film I recommend for all ages.
710,5019281,5,This has always been one of my favorites. I saw it when it first aired and was excited to see it again.
711,5019281,5,I have searched for this film for years and finally found it here on Amazon. Saw it on television years ago and it was one I knew I wanted.
712,5019281,4,Henry Winkler is the one of the best Scrooge I've seen! We see a lot of Scrooge movies this was a breath of fresh air.
713,5019281,5,A great acting job by Henry Winkler. I saw this many years ago and it'll always be a Christmas favorite.
714,5019281,4,"I'm a big fan of Christmas Carol-esk stories so I gave it an extra star for that. Of course, the storyline is cheesy and overworked in these types of movies but I actually enjoyed it. And Henry Winkler was excellent."
715,5019281,3,Worth watching this new version of the classic.  It is a little slow in parts but still entertaining. The real negative issue and distraction throughout is Henry Winkler's make up that is supposed to make him look old.  It just looks like Henry Winkler with make-up that is supposed to make him look old.  Even if you did not know the actor you would know that it was makeup and not an old man.  The wig was very good though--looked very authentic.
716,5019281,4,It was a nice twist on the classic. Henry Winkler is much better actor than most people think of him!
717,5019281,2,"This is a first for me, I didn't like this movie and I think I only had it on for about 20 minutes.  Acting just wasn't there."
718,5019281,5,"Loved it - a different  twist on the Classic Christmas Carol, however the message is the same. It is such a needed message in this day and time. This version brought me to tears."
719,5019281,3,"Just  OK, I had a a hard time putting ""Fonzie"" as a gruff person, and to me it was just OK, glad I watched it but not one of my favorites."
720,5019281,5,"I truely feel, this is the best version of Christmas Carol ever made. Henry Winkler did a great justice to this movie."
721,5019281,5,"This has been a favorite movie of mine for a long time.  Henry winkler is great as a modern day Scrooge.  There are many movies giving a new twist to Dickens, but this one is true to the original story.  It is set during the depression."
722,5019281,4,"I 'collect' movie versions of 'A Christmas Carol', This is a very good one. It is true to the spirit of the book while putting an American spin on it. If you really like Dicken's story you will probably enjoy this version."
723,5019281,5,"It is very hard to find this version of ""A Christmas Carol"" and it happens to be both my and my mom's favorite!! So I was thrilled to find it on Amazon! Yay!! :)"
724,5019281,5,"The Christmas Carol is one of my favorite Christmas stories, and there have been a lot of different versions made. This one, with Henry Winkler, is different. He does a wonderful job playing Scrooge!! The setting is in depression era America, instead of England, and that makes this version better (I think). It's like watching history.

This movie is definitely worth watching!!"
725,5019281,5,How a bitter old man comes to know the true meaning of Christmas. Realizing to late his lost love and life.
726,5019281,5,"I watched this when it came out on tv way back when, and I have looked for it ever since. I was so shocked when I saw it on here and I just had to have it. WATCH THIS, IT IS GREAT!!"
727,5019281,2,"We began watching this video, but stopped it a short way into it when we realized this was not what we had hoped for.  It was too contrived and predictable."
728,5019281,5,Every few Christmas seasons I watch this with my Mom.  The film makes us feel so good....it is well acted and never fails to leave a good feeling inside.
729,5019281,5,"I purchased this for a coworker for Christmas. I haven't given it to her yet. But she has recommended this movie to me, so I am sure she will greatly enjoy it."
730,5019281,4,"this movie stars henry winkler. an enjoyable christmas tale. he was superb in this role. a twist on the old ""scrooge""."
731,5019281,4,I love this movie and was happy to find it on dvd. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good christmas movie.
732,5019281,5,"I almost began with ""what can I say"". Well, thinking about it I can say much about this Christmas tale. It is a great twist on a classic holiday movie. Henry Winkler is well know for his role as the ""Fonz"". He owned this movie through his portrayal of a miserable miser. His gradual aging from youth to old age was quite amazing. Oh Henry, you prove over and over what a quality actor can do for stage and screen."
733,5019281,5,"Among the best of this beloved Christmas story; We enjoy Henry Winkler's twist on Scrooge and the story-line. He makes for a very believable Scrooge, both pre and post ""redemption""!"
734,5019281,4,Been looking for this movie for a long time. It is a good twist on a classic novel. Besides it is Fonzy!
735,5019281,5,"This Henry Winkler film never received (even today) the attention it deserved. An American adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic tale, this film will quickly become a Christmas family favorite for any household which celebrates the holiday. It's a must-see picture, and is genuinely different from the original English version of the story. You won't be disappointed!"
736,5019281,5,"I can't believe how long it took ""them"" to get this wonderful Christmas show on DVD. It's a modern (1930s America) twist on Charles Dickens' classic tale. Winkler makes me hate his character as much as Alister Sim did in his portrayal of Scrooge in the 1951 production. Certainly one for your visual library."
737,5019281,5,We have been looking for this movie for over 15 years and were delighted to finally find it available on dvd!  Love love love it!
738,5019281,5,My husband and I have a Christmas movie collection which includes about 20 different versions of The Christmas Carol.  I wasn't expecting much from this but was delightfully surprised.  It was a very different yet wonderful rendition.
739,5019281,5,"In my opinion, the best of the Christmas Carol movies. Henry Winkler does a good job portraying Scrooge, especially with his reputation as the Fonz."
740,5019281,5,"I always loved this version of Scrooge and I'm glad it's finally been released on blue ray.
So so so happy."
741,5019281,5,This is a great movie. One of the better versions of A Christmas Carol out there. Henry Winkler proves what a great actor he is. Well worth a watch.
742,5019281,5,Been waiting for this to come to DVD - the remastered picture is great. Much better than my old VHS copy
743,5019281,5,"I saw this movie a long time ago, actually my brother taped it on a VHS and let me borrow it (guess that tells yu how long ago it was!)  Anyway if you like the old Christmas Carol movies...you'll love this one."
744,5019281,5,"I thought that I would never find this dvd, but they had. It was just what I was looking for. Thanks so much."
745,5019281,4,"Reproduction is first rate. Limited extras but interesting. I think the original production was on par with other TV movies of the time. The adaption of A Christmas Carol to a Depression era setting was well done. Henry Winkler is excellent in portraying the bitter  old man. If you have a Christmas DVD collection, like me, this belongs in it."
746,5019281,5,"I have always loved this rendition of A Christmas Carol with it's american twist.  I had it on VHS but finally gave up my player for a DVD player.
Previously only bootlegged copies were available.  I was very happy to find it recently produced on DVD/Bluray.
It is a great Holiday movie."
747,5019281,5,"I love all the Christmas Carol movies!!!  I had seem this movie only once, when it came out of TV n never saw it again on TV.  I was always looking for it but  could not remember the name of it, only that the actor had been Henry Winkler. Finally I saw it on Amazon and right away bought it n sure enough it was the same movie I had seen in the 70s."
748,5019281,5,I enjoy watching Henry Winkler other then as the Fonz. He is at his best in this movie. I recommend this movie.
749,5019281,3,"Henry Winkler just did not seem like Scrooge. It felt more like an actor playing Scrooge. In other words, I could not enjoy it as well as some of the other actors as Scrooge. Alistair Sim or Patrick Stewart were much better as Scrooge."
750,5019281,5,I was very happy with the time it took to deliver.  The quality of the movie is great!  The DVD case was a little thin.
751,5019281,5,I had forgotten about this movie til I saw it on Amazon. Loved it when it came out and still do. The Fonz is really cool in this modern holiday classic.
752,5019281,5,i have always liked this movie it was suppose to be based in my home town which made it more interesting.  It still follows the story line of Charles Dickens with the ghosts and all but still a very good story.
753,5019281,4,This arrived in good time. It was in good condition. I haven't had a chance to watch it yet. I am happy with this purchase so far.
754,5019281,5,Movie arrived quickly and in perfect condition. It has been remastered and the colors and quality are so much better than our version on VHS we purchased years ago.
755,5019281,5,"I gave this a 5 because it gets close to home about how we should care for one another. The other ones are good but this one actually shows us a picture of how America should be. Also, the quality of the dvd was excellent."
756,5019281,5,"This is a great movie that sets the classic tale of A Christmas Carol in a very American setting.  Set in the time of the Great Depression the character of Scrooge played by Henry Winkler is perfect for this. The heartwarming change of his character, although well known by most, is given such a unique spin that this should become a classic in its own right. The attention to detail by the costuming and sets are wonderful and the makeup staff did an amazing job at aging the young Henry Winkler. You will not regret watching this new twist on the classic tale."
757,5019281,4,"Scrooge is  my favorite story at christmas time.  However, I thought it went quite a bit off from the original story.  Still, we liked it very much, and would watch it again."
758,5019281,5,"My daughter saw this movie when she was young and we have waited years for it to become available. We purchased this as a christmas gift for her, She just loves it. Thank you"
759,5019281,4,"Saw this movie many years ago, and checked for it to be on TV for several years, to no avail.  So happy to find this version.  Henry Winkler did a wonderful job."
760,5019281,5,This is a timeless classic which shows that those people from the Depression era experienced a lot of what might have taken place in England during the time of Dickens.
761,5019281,4,Purchased this for my mother since she has been looking for a copy. She was so happy when she opened it on Christmas!
762,5019281,5,"I thought Henry Winkler was superb as scrooge. It was a wonderful movie. I would recommend it to anyone, good family viewing"
763,5019281,5,"My wife's all time favorite Christmas movie around this time of year.  Have been searching for years for this item, and prices up until this year were outrageous.  Product came well packaged with no issues and on time for Christmas eve.  Made my wife's Christmas Eve to have this back in our collection"
764,5019281,5,He did a great job as a Scrooge type character. I truly enjoyed this film. I liked him from the Happy Days show.
765,5019281,3,"Typical made for TV movie, Can't say that Henry Winkler was one of the best Scrooges we have seen, but enjoyed it. We are collecting all versions of this film that we can find."
766,5019281,5,Best Christmas movie ever I'm glad they released it on DVD been looking for along time and now I have it thanks
767,5019281,5,This is one of my favorites... I was very happy to see it on this site. Henry Winkler  played this part well.
768,5019281,5,I love Scrooge and this is one of the best I have seen. I saw it a long time agoand I have wanted to get it every since.
769,5019281,5,Happy Days stifled Henry's gift as a very great actor. This movie demonstrates subtle nuances that showcase his talent and tell a great story. This film manages to tell a familiar story in a more contemporary setting that is pretty balanced for a made-for-TV. Recommend highly!
770,5019281,5,I hadn't seen this in decades and was thrilled to see it again.  The interview with Henry Winkler was a nice plus!
771,5019281,5,"We (my daughter and I) have collected just about every one of the DVD ""Christmas Carols""... This was always a favorite of mine and We finally got a copy... It was great to watch it again.."
772,5019281,3,"Henry Winkler was good and this was a pretty good adaptation of Dickens's story. Supporting cast could have been better, but not bad if you've seen all of the regular versions of A Christmas Carol."
773,5019281,5,"Excellent Movie
An American Christmas Carol is one to watch every year.
Henry Winkler does an outstanding job in this role"
774,5019281,5,"This is one of the best Dickens based Christmas movies of all time.  Henry Winkler portrays a very believable rendition as Benedict Slade, the American ""Scrooge"".  I make it a yearly ""must see"" every Christmas season.  There is one scene that, no matter how many times I view it, brings tears to my eyes.  If you like ""feel good"" Christmas movies, don't miss this one!!"
775,5019281,5,Henry Winkler does an excellent job as the stingy Mr Slade.  The counterpart to Ebeneezer Scrooge in this adaptation of the classic story.  It was wonderfully done.
776,5019281,5,"I've been looking for this DVD for a long time. Everytime I found it, it was sold out.
This is a wonderful turn on ""Scrooge""...Henry Winkler shows just how good an actor he really is.
Would recommend as an alternative to the yearly Ebeneezer movies."
777,5019281,5,"The movie was everything that we expected.  When we had recorded the movie from the TV with all the commercials. We had been looking for the VSH or DVD, but could not find it in the stores. When I checked Amazon and you had the movie I jumped on purchasing it. Thank you for caring things that you can't find in Department Stores."
778,5019281,5,"Henry Winkler is one of my favorite actors of all time.  He is wonderful in An American Christmas Carol!  This is another movie that has not been shown at Christmas in the last few years, but should be.  So glad that I could get it for my collection of favorite Christmas movies."
779,5019281,5,I found this take on Scrooge a very interesting and new . Sent it as a gift to my sisiter-in-law to enjoy also !
780,5019281,5,"Henry Winkler is a gifted actor and pulls off the part of an older man with style.  A new way to look at Dickens classic A Christmas Carol.  I remember this from years ago and was pleased to find it on DVD.
Great family entertainment."
781,5019281,4,"The story line is great, and still love the message, but the picture quality of the reproduction was not the best. But all in all still love the film"
782,5019281,5,This is a great movie.  I purchased it for my kindle fire and watched it and it still is a movie I love.  It was clear and the sound was great.  I can not stress enough how clear this is and how words can not express enough of how this movie is.  I will be getting more HD movies for the kindle fire.  Great for traveling for me.
783,5019281,4,"I like to think that I have a great collection of all the video versions of this story.  Had to have this one to keep current.  Predictable story, interesting ghosts, and a stellar performance by Winkler."
784,5019281,5,"Henry Winkler does a great job in this production that gives an American slant to the famous ""A Christmas Carol.""  He portrays a ruthless and emtionless business man and how he repossesses people's beloved items on which they can no longer make payments.  He is so sure he is right in these endeavors, and he has a basement full of his collections to prove how he can outwit others and survive.  I saw this movie on TV over 15 years ago, but have never been able to find it on DVD.  It is now available on DVD, and I highly recommend this movie."
785,5019281,5,I have always enjoyed this movie.  I had it on DVD but wanted it on Blue Ray and the quality is excellent.  I have no complaints and am very pleased to buy from Amazon.
786,5019281,5,"This has not been on TV, that I know of in many years but really great performance by Henry Winkler. Thank you."
787,5019281,5,"An American Christmas Carol is one of my favorite all time Christmas movies. Henry Winkler is surperb in his performance as a depression era scrooge. I encourage people to watch, they will not be disappointed. Patrick Wallace"
788,5019281,1,"Dickens writing is poetry of the highest order, and as a story teller he has few peers.  Henry Winkler's monotone delivery of the Christmas Carol combined with a trite and confusing screen play was only made worse by the frequent interruptions of a black screen, since this was an adaptation of a TV production in 1979 converted to a DVD.  The make-up in the movie was distracting to a fault, looking like it had been applied with a masonry trowel and topped by one of the worst hairpieces since George Burns was alive.

Although the new Scrooge's premise had promise by changing the setting of the story from Victorian England to Depression Era America, the writers did not take advantage of the fairy tale capacities of the story and moral lessons, best taught as allegories.  In this sense having the four visitations (Marley, plus Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come) done in the context of real-life characters from the TV production itself, had a less dramatic impact on the events.  Simply stated, Marley should have been a tortured spirit, attempting to right a long life of wrong decisions instead of appearing like a characterized mobster from a B-movie.  In addition the 70's hipster, as Christmas Yet to Come, was several decades from being relevant to the plot, or as sinister, foreboding and silent as the representation of a lonely death.  Last, but not least, the conclusion of the story appeared rushed and lacked substance, more so than many versions I have seen. In this sense sending the young boy to Australia to cure his malady was more detail than I required and most likely confusing to anyone not familiar with the period in America.

This review (2012) is based on a recent watching of the video I purchased a number of years ago for my collection. However, if you are reading this you should understand the context in which the TV movie was made.  Winkler was at the height of his popularity from the Happy Days series when he portrayed this part, and in addition to his early success, has evolved into an accomplished actor, director, producer and author.  It all goes to show you that one bad decision does not a career make, so there is hope for all of us, every one."
789,5019281,4,"""An American Christmas Carol ""is different in some ways from the original "" A Christmas Carol "". At least the characters names are changed in this movie. I have seen many versions of this story and have enjoyed all of them. This is not my most favorite version of all,but it is maybe my fourth favorite. I like the original story better, that is why I gave it 4 stars. It does do a good job of telling the story of Scrooge, even with the name changes. It is the same general idea. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the original story."
790,5019281,5,"Take A Christmas Carol and place it in the middle of the great depression and you have this movie. For me I like this version because it explains more of the back story for the Scrooge character. I also like in the end that despite having his change of heart he is still very much himself. In stead of all of the sudden being great with kids and more at ease in social settings, he is still somewhat uncomfortable in these situations. For me it was a little more realistic. Henry Winkler did a great job as this character and I loved the interview with him as he described how he became ""Scrooge""."
791,5019281,5,"Henry Winkler does a great acting job as he protrays ""Mr. Scrooge."" Here again one the whole family can enjoy!"
792,5019281,4,"As we were picking Christmas movies this year, I remembered seeing one with Henry Winkler.  Took me a while to find it because I didn't recall the title correctly.  Told my wife she would really like it.  Was not disappointed.  A very good Christmas classic in my book.  Winkler is terrific in this role."
793,5019281,5,A Family Classic and Henry Winkler makes it great. I would make a great gift for any of your family or friends.
794,5019281,5,"As usual, Henry Winkler gave a superb performance, (Way to go Fonzie). Owning quite a few movies and cartoons on the Christmas Carol, I must say that this version has a somewhat modern, 20th century, yet fitting theme. I loved it. Highly recommended!"
795,5019281,5,"Although my husband prefers the original Christmas carol, he does like this as well.  I love it. Henry Winkler is very good in this movie. A nice change from the original Christmas carol movies."
796,5019281,5,"A wonderful story about the Christmas Spirit & how it changed the life of a very lonely, old miser.  A true witness that it is ''NEVER TOO LATE''  to open up you heart & life to others."
797,5019281,5,Excellent movie. One of my favorite Christmas Carol versions. The movie takes on the usual Christmas Carol story with an American twist. Henry Winkler is a great actor.
798,5019281,5,Great twist on the original Christmas Carol. I have always enjoyed this one and it is never seen on television anymore.
799,5019281,5,Henry Winkler played a great part as Scrooge.  It gave yet another twist to all the Christmas Carols of the past.
800,5019281,5,"I was so thankful to come across this dvd. For some reason during the Christmas season they never show this movie on any of the numerous cable stations anyore. I haven't seen this movie on tv since the 1980's and I don't understand why, it is such a good movie and Henry Winkler's performance is terrific. I believe Happy Days was still on tv at this time albiet it was probably during the end of the series. The only place to find this movie was through Amazon just as they don't play it on tv you can't find the dvd in the stores either so the ability to find this movie was almost impossible except thankfully through Amazon. I would never pay as much for a dvd as I did for this one but it is one of my husbands favorite Christmas movies so it had a special meaning to surprise him with this as a gift, so thank you."
801,5019281,5,"I received the DVD within days; it was exactly what I wanted. It was a gift for my father for Christmas, we watched the DVD together as a family. Billing was easy, shipping was earlier than expected and product was exactly what I wanted."
802,5019281,5,"My brother loves this Henry Winkler version of A Christmas Carol called ""An American Christmas Carol"" and wanted it for his DVD Christmas collection. Its not in the stores and my brother was too cheap to purchase a DVD over $20, so it was the perfect gift!  I also purchased the suggested ""Most Wonderful Time of the Year"" with Henry Winkler, my brother hasn't watched it yet but said he has never seen it before, so I was happy Amazon suggested it also.  They arrived quickly and securely, overall 5 stars of happiness with Amazon."
803,5019281,5,I enjoyed this TV production the first time I saw it in 1979 or 1980 and really enjoyed it this time.  It is obvious that it is a TV production but most of the acting is good and the story set in the depression is good.  I am very happy it was still available.
804,5019281,5,"So hard to find this movie - it is by far the best SCROOGE of them all - used to play on TV every year but not for a long time now, so glad to have my copy now"
805,5019281,5,"I worked for an ABC station in the 70's and early 80's so I knew and watched when this movie first aired.  I wasn't expecting a great show, just one of those expositions of ABC stars like ""Love American Style"" was in that error.  I was very surprised and my wife even cried.  This is a well written, well directed and edited movie.  Not corny but as the title denotes, with a script that moves away from the original script.  In this era of NAFTA and trade treaties this message is as timely as it was in the period of the movie.  Also Henry Winkler, who obviously plays the character in several ages, does a great job."
806,5019281,5,"This is a great movie, one that has truly been overlooked as one of the great ""Christmas Classics. It brings an refreshing twist to the ageless story of redemption."
807,5019281,5,A classic tale which has not been regularly shown on TV for years. This is one of the all time greats and Henry Winkler's performance is outstanding.  Highly recommended!
808,5019281,5,"I last watched this movie sometime back in the 80's when it used to be on regularly around Christmas time on TV. I loved this movie as it was an interesting and engaging alternative to the more common Scott and Finney versions of the classic Christmas Carol that always got the most airtime. It depicts depression era New England with a cold, grey feeling that really comes across the screen without bogging the movie down and having grown up in Boston, it makes it that much more intersting to me. The acting is top-notch, particularly from Henry Winkler. It was always one of my favorite Christmas specials. Then it went off the air never to return sometime back then (80's, 90's, I'm not sure exactly when) and I never forgot about it and often pined to watch it again but somehow always seemed to forget to look for it on VHS, DVD, or online. I stumbled onto it on Amazon via my Roku box and was delighted to see it again and purchased it so I can once again enjoy this teriffic movie with my kids! Any fan of A Christmas Carol (or just really good Christmas movies) should immediately get this movie in their collection!"
809,5019281,5,"This is an excellent movie.  I had not seen it for many years.  It used to be on television every Christmas, but not in the last several years.  I checked Amazon and there it was.  I watched with my daughter the other night - she had never seen it before.  She enjoyed it.  Well worth watching."
810,5019281,5,I had been looking for this dvd for years.  Finally able to find on Amazon and am very pleased with the dvd.
811,5019281,5,"For years this edition of The Christmas Carol was shown on TV but has not been for the past ten years.  I bought this DVD four years ago and still enjoy it each December.
It is a great story of a man who finally realizes, it is never too late to live life!"
812,5019281,5,"Henry Winkler did a wonderful acting job as Benedict Slade. I first saw this movie online recently and wonder how I missed never seeing it on TV. And not just his acting but it seemed all actors did a great job in this American version of Scrooge. After seeing it online I ordered it right away to add to our Christmas collection. If you haven't seen it I believe you will be pleasantly surprised. If you enjoy other adaptations of Scrooge you will certainly enjoy this movie.

If you would like to read more or order the dvd click this link. I've added it for your convenience, not persuaded by the seller.

[...]"
813,5019281,5,"Saw this years ago on network TV and remembered how much I liked it. Winkler did a great job as the ""scrooge"" character. A more ""true to life"" version of ""A Christmas Carol""."
814,5019281,5,"Most of us remember Henry Winkler in the role of Arthur ""The Fonz"" Fonzarelli on Happy Days. I took a chance on this. He's an even better actor than I remember. The story is set during the depression. Henry's character reposesses furniture rented from him by various poor families. Instead of ghosts, he has visions involving the people he's left destitute. Not sappy like some Christmas Carol renditions are. I was favorably impressed by the story as well as the acting. Gerard Parks (Doc from Fraggle Rock) was also in it, as was a young Dorian Harewood. A nice addition to my Christmas Carol collection."
815,5019281,5,This is one of my favorite versions of the Scrooge story but they never show it now I can watch when I want to
816,5019281,5,I saw this movie on tv years ago one time. I always look for it every year to come back on tv. I never see it listed. It is a very good version of A Christmas Carol. Throughly enjoyed the video.
817,5019281,5,Henry Winkler was great and so was the cast.  I saw this years ago and very happy I could own it.  A great American take on an English classic.
818,5019281,5,"This is one of my two favorite adaptations of this classic. Henry Winkler plays an outstanding Scrooge character and this is my favorite role of his, cheesy moustache notwithstanding.

You will also find many great lines about life (look for the comment about ""the larger state"", ""records"" & ""if"").

Buy this movie, you won't regret it."
819,5019281,4,The title says it all - this is a Christmas carol re-done. Henery Winkler play the part of Scrooge in this American version of the timeless Classic It is well worth the investment if you are a collector of the Christmas carol stories.
820,5019281,5,"""An American Christmas Carol"" is a quintessential version of Dickens' classic tale set during the depression.  I view it every year.  Henry Winkler does a wonderful job of the ""Scrooge"" character and his supporting cast does equally well.  It should be consider a classic film and is definitely one of the best versions of ""A Christmas Carol""."
821,5019281,4,"It is on the same basis as other Christmas Carol movies, just played a little differently and with Henry Winkler as the scrooge.  We enjoyed it. Now we have it and can bring it out each Christmas.  Aside from the review I wanted to say I had ordered the item late and figured I would not get it until after Christmas, but it was shipped out standard and I received it in a very few days."
822,5019281,5,i loved henry winkler in this movie i thought he did a great job  of acting
823,5019281,4,"My family really enjoys this more modern re-telling of Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol."" You have all of the basic elements set in depression-era America. Henry Winkler is fantastic as both the crotchety old Mr. Slade and the idealistic young Mr. Slade. It should really be part of your holiday movie collection."
824,5019281,3,This is the classic story with a fresh look. I like it. I owned this on VHS and was pleasantly surprised to find it on disc.
825,5019281,5,"What an enjoyable movie, it is a good one to have to go along with all my other versions of The Christmas Carol. It was a different role for Henry Winkler but he made a good Scrooge!"
826,5019281,4,I first saw this movie as a kid in the late 70's. I never forgot and when i found it on dvd i could not resist. It brought just as much enjoyment now as then. I like the twist on a classic with an American version.
827,5019281,5,"This version of Dickens classic tale was a made for tv special in 1979. I first saw it when I was a kid and have watched it every year since. Henry Winkler does a great job as Benidict Slade, a Scrooge like charecter who needs to find the meaning of giving again. Sure the make up and some of the dialogue are dated, but the true meaning of the story shines through. If you have never seen this classic then try it out."
828,5019281,1,"I thought I remembered this film as a good one from television many years ago but I had obviously forgotten it completely. It's poor quality film, dated and badly written. Henry Winkler's make up is just awful. I couldn't watch it through to the end. I collect Christmas Carol films  but this one that will never go in the dvd player again!"
829,5019281,5,Glad that this american classic came out on dvd.  I have been waiting for it for a long time.  I haven't seen this production since it came out years ago.  Plus it's better than some Hallmark holiday movies.
830,5019281,4,"The best thing about this movie is that its not much different than the Christmas Carols that came before it.

Seriously, the setting is changed, its moved to a small New England town during the Great Depression. This is the perefect setting, the time and place are quite reminiscent of Dickens' London, so you don't have the distraction from making major changes. Aside from the setting, you have a fairly typical Christmas Carol. Sure, Henry Winkler's Benedict Slade doesn't go around saying bah humbug, nor does he have a nephew, but he's no different than Ebeneezer Scrooge. Nor is he a boy growing up in a boarding school (tyical for England at the time) hated by his father for his mother dying in childbirth, instead he's an orphan. Same impact, but appropriate for the time and place.

As a TV movie, its a bit lacking compared to other versions, the budget is more visible than typical, but wise use of settings and lesser TV actors help. While many of the supporting cast are familiar, none are stars of any sort, just standard supporting actors. The play like use of three of Slade's debtors to represent the three spirits works very well, giving their parts more weight and saving the production money, ditto for the reuse of sets when they're not outside. The ghost of Christmas future is the greatest departure from the original, after all, in this movie he can talk, and we actually see what he looks like. And his very dated arrival is a bit funnier than was intended, but that journey still carries weight.

Over all, well done and believable without significantly rewriting a classic. I recommend this as the best of the alternates for those who like a bit of variety without a complete rewrite of the story."
831,5019281,5,"This is one of the best Christmas stories out there.
It was on T.V 15 or 20 years ago, I've been trying to track it down ever since.
It's the Christmas Carol - Scrooge story but with a new twist.
It takes place in America during the depression.

Received the product in excellent condition, in the expected time.
At a good price."
832,5019281,5,"How coincidental that this program, aired by ABC in 1979, is set in the USA during the Depression era and here we are 30 years later, in 2009, experiencing an economic malaise of our own!  I remember having seen this on TV but viewing it again now on DVD made me realize that I'd forgotten about how downright mean and cold-hearted Henry Winkler's character, Benedict Slade, really is!!!  Politically-correct viewing in the 21st Century has really insulated from harsh emotions such as those portrayed by Mr. Winkler.  The production has that 70's look to it but it is well done and the actors and actresses all bring an unpolished genuine-ness to their parts.  Being a fan of ""A Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens, I am pleased to have this rendition alongside other classic versions as well as the 1984 IBM production."
833,5019281,5,"Henry Winkler is excellent. The only thing I have to say is, there was too much time spent on his Christmas past. I got bored with it. Otherwise, it was good and worth the money."
834,5019281,4,"Not the best quality DVD, but it's a great story. I recommend it to all."
835,5019281,5,"this is my favorite twist on the orginal christmas carol.if you collect and enjoy different versions of this story this is a must have. henry winkler is fantastic, and the character transformation from a crabbie tight wad to a friendly giving man was very convincing . in the end his way of ""paying it forward"" added a new ending to an old classic."
836,5019281,4,Since I was a child many years past I have been interested in Dickens Christmas Carol. When I saw this version it stood out amoung the many other versions out there. Henry Winkler plays a good scrooge charactor. The story itself is based on Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol and the story sticks very close to the original with a 1920s depiction of the American depression.
837,5019281,5,"The best Christmas movie ever!  I saw this when it was aired on TV back in 1979 and purchased it on VHS when it became available.  It was our family tradition for years to watch this on Thanksgivng evening. I bought DVD copies for my children who now have families of their own who will carry on the tradition.
  Henry Winkler is amazing in this! No matter how many times I've seen this, I still laugh and cry."
838,5019281,5,Enjoyed the movie very much. It had been years since I had seen it on television. It is not on tv any more.
839,5019281,4,This modern adaptation of A Christmas Carol is engaging and includes a well-known modern screen actor.  The inclusion of an orphanage as background material also gives an individual twist to this classic.
840,5019281,4,"I have always liked Henry Winkler's performance in ths movie. Although not as acclaimed as the Dicken's 'Christmas Carol', I liked the setting in colonial America."
841,5019281,5,"Love ""A Christmas Carol"" with Reginald Owens In 1938.  But this Henry Winkler version has a nice twist on the original version, but nothing too way out. Hard to find movie now."
842,5019281,5,"This is the American adaptation of the Charles Dickens' classic.  It is interesting that in the movie the main character is seen ripping the pages out of a collector's item book of ""A Christmas Carol.""

Henry Winkler gives an outstanding performance as Benedict Slade, a loan officer who reclaims valued possessions of those unable to make late payments on Christmas Eve.

His visit by the spirits, the life in the orphanage and how one man helped him, leads to a very sentimental ending.

It would have been good if the images could be enhanced for better viewing.  This originally was a 'made-for-TV' program and is presented complete with the fade-outs for the commercial breaks.

David Wayne gives a great performance as the book owner as well as Christmases past."
843,5019281,5,"The Christmas Carol is my all-time favorite movie, and I had ever version imagionable on VHS, including this adaptation, but the remarkably enhanced quality of the DVD version is extremely enjoyable to watch. This rendition gives it an American twist, as Henry Winkler did a wonderful performance of a modern-day Scrooge."
844,5019281,5,"I was so excited to get a dvd of ""an american christmas carol"".
the quality is great and the service was excellent. this is one of our favorite christmas movies."
845,5019281,5,"93 Snazzes on the 100 Point Snazz-O-Scale! An excellent and original adaption.

An American Christmas Carol is a superb and original adaption of the Dickens Christmas classic. Henry Wrinkler stars as the Scrooge character, Benedict Slade. He does a great job as a hardnosed old man, and he does look convincing in aged make up. The story takes place in New England America, during the Great Depression.
-An American Christmas Carol is unique in many ways. Slade doesn't believe he's evil or even a miser; he's just a practical businessman. On Christmas Eve he and his employee, Thatcher, go out in their truck to repossess items - to take back what is rightly his, Slade says. When carolers show up at Slade's door, he doesn't chase them away with a stick like Scrooge did, he congratulates them on their wonderful singing and offers them a present: A small book he printed up at his own expense on how to save money and make yourself a future.
-Slade's deceased business partner Jack Latham appears and he offers some stunning quotes.

""Hell isn't what you think it is, devils with pitchforks, fire and brimstone.""
""Thank God,"" Slade responds.
""It's worse,"" Latham says.

A short while later Slade says ""But you were a man of business, Latham. You drove a hard bargain but you never did anything evil!""
""Evil isn't just what you do,"" Latham replies, ""It's also what you DON'T do.""

A wonderful sentiment. The whole movie is full of incredible quotes and comments on generosity, history, a man's life, and a man's effect on the people and world around him.
-As a unique feature I've never seen in any other adaption, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are played by Slade's customers, the very people he just repossessed items from. Slade actually believes them to be the same people, having broken into his warehouse. Until they provide a sample of their supernatural powers. The spirits are heralded by Slade's old radio broadcasting music and news from either the past or the future, even when it's unplugged.
-Another unique thing is once Slade has seen the light and transformed into a better man, he is still a bit of a grump. As if the transformation isn't instantaneous and is still a work in progress. He is more generous, more concerned with the welfare of others, including the town, the unemployed, his employee Thatcher and his sick son, the orphanage where he once stayed at, but he has a very nice and realistic bite to him yet.
-The movie comments on the Dickens work frequently. ""Did you read that book, Mister Slade?"" a bookseller asks, after Slade has reformed.
""The ghost of hell? The ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future? Complete and utter ... what was the word he used?""
""Humbug?"""
846,5019281,4,"Enjoyed watching this,I have looked for years for the Henry Winkler verson. Got it very fast. Great quality,much better than vhs."
847,5019281,5,"I remember seeing this when it was first broadcast on TV. I loved it then and loved being able to watch it on DVD for the first time in almost 30 years. Other reviewers have provided story details, so I'll just say that this is a sweet movie that has aged well. If you are already considering this purchase then you are bound to like it."
848,5019281,5,This is an excellent remake of the Dickins' A Christmas Carol.  It should be placed along side your existing Christmas collection!
849,5019281,5,"We'd taped this from TV years ago and I was delighted to find this version on Amazon.  Winkler is fantastic as the Scrooge character.  While the story-line has been modified to be early 20th century New England the elements of the original Dickens story are preserved in this version.  I'm a ""Christmas Carol"" fanatic and this is a super addition to my collection.  Buy it- you won't be disappointed!"
850,5019281,4,"This is a charming version of the classic Dicken's tale.  Henry Winkler makes a good showing as the ""Scrooge"" character.  Even though you know what will happen this version has enough of a change to make it better that average.  If you love A Christmas Carol in any version, then you will love this."
851,5019281,5,"Henry Winkler is very good in this twist on the classic story. Not a conventional remake, but a version of the story set in early America. Give it a try."
852,5019281,4,"A brilliant adaptation of Dickson's classic set in early 20th century New England.  Well written and well acted, Henry Winkler shines as a young entrepreneur who is more interested in wealth and progress than romance and family, until...  I don't want to give it away.  Trust me. You'll love it."
853,5019281,4,"Fun DVD and I always like the Christmas Carol, this is not quite up as high as others but I still watch it every year."
854,5019281,5,"""Scrooge"" will never be seen the same after you watch Henry Winkler perform!
  He brings depth to his character and makes this story more than merely an old miser waking up to the wretched reality of his existence.  ""Mr. Slade"" becomes someone we can understand, someone whose ambitions become a source of tragedy in his life; it was never his intention to become such a cold-hearted skinflint -- he simply allowed his thirst for ""success"" to blind his view.
  For anyone who appreciates art in its purest form, this movie is a must!!"
855,5019281,5,"A friend put me on to this a few years back when he asked me to find it for him on DVD.  A Christmas Carol is a yearly read for me (at least once) and the Patrick Stewart version, being well-casted and closest to the book text, is also a yearly event, for me.  I also like the George C. Scott version, however, with reservations as other reviews mentioned - the annoying changes on some of the key points of the story.  That is to give you an idea where I am coming from with this version.  The title describes what you're getting - the Christmas Carol story with an American flavor.  Henry Winkler is excellent and, considering the time in which this was made, the production value is fairly good!!  Dorian Harewood is my favorite of the three ""ghosts"" who visit him and (SPOILER ALERT) I like the twist of having the visiting ghosts be the same people he was mistreating.  Depression-era America doesn't have nearly the ""romantic"" quality that Victorian England does, but it works well with the story.  Overall, a worthy addition to your collection of Christmas Carol movies.  Also, kudos to Image entertainment for re-releasing this at a reasonable price and getting rid of the dreaded snap-case."
856,5019281,5,"I have been looking for this particular video for some time (video stores and garage sales) It is not shown on regular t.v. any more and I was thrilled to see if for sale.  I would have paid what ever ther person wanted, but it turns out that I paid a very small fee and made my husband very happy.  The only thing I could say that was misleading was the mail time - when purchasing this I was told it would be at my door on December 17th and I did not receive it until December 22nd.  I try to understand it was the ""season"" but when it was shipped on the 14th it is very hard to see why when I live in a very populated city (tampa bay area)"
857,5019281,3,My wife told me of this movie in which Henry Winkler stars & shows he can act in this different version of a Chrismas Carol.
858,5019281,5,I feel this is one of the very best Christmas movies of all times.  If I had the ownership of this movie I would reissue it into the movie theaters at Christmastime. Henry Winkler acting is purely magical.
859,5019281,5,I really enjoy this movie.  Its a Christmas Carol slightly reworked and looks like a television production.  I think Winkler does a good job covering all the age changes required.  I have it on my list of 5 or 6 must see DVDs every Christmas Season.
860,5019281,3,Should be included in your holiday movies collection.  Funny though to be reminded how much TV you watched BEFORE a commercial break back in the early 80's (as it was a made for TV movie).  Henry Winkler does a great job playing an American/Depression era version of Mr Scrooge.  Corny (but what Christmas Carol version isn't?) but fun.
861,5019281,5,"Our family loves the modern tones to this classic story.  Henry Winkler is a joy to watch and each character plays their part perfectly.  I watched this as a little girl, and now my children are enjoying it as well. As the story unfolds I find myself furious with Slade, compassionate toward him and then in the end celebrating with him as he decides to take his new found joy and help someone else...we just love it!"
862,5019281,4,"This movie was made in 1979, when Henry Winkler was in his heyday of playing ""The Fonz"" on ""Happy Days"".  It was exciting back then to see what else he could do, and he came through admirably.

This movie hasn't played on TV in at least a decade that I remember, and it should be, for it's a fresh take on the old Dickens tale.

The setting is Concord, NH in 1933, and miserly Benedict Slade goes about repossessing people's furniture, stoves, radios - and even a piano from a children's orphanage! - on Christmas Eve.

Then come the visitations and, well, we know the rest of the story.

Pick it up for a treat for next Christmas."
863,5019281,4,"I loved this film when it was on tv when I was in High School; seeing it on DVD was an enjoyable experience, but I found an annoying problem in continuity: Winkler's character seems to be growing up in the 1890s, which is fine, but at one point we see him at a WWI War Bond Rally, and he seems to be in his early-thirties.  Yet just fifteen years later, during the Great Depression, he's a very old man.  So what's the deal?  It seems as if the film's producers just happened to have a few WWI-era cars and costumes and posters hanging around, so they decided to twist time around to fit the props.  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense for Winkler's character to be a young boy in what seems to be the early-Industrial Revolution, then a young man during WWI, then a very old man during the Depression.  Very odd.

I have to believe that if they hadn't had some WWI posters and banners and cars available, they would have cut out the War Bond Rally part and kept the continuity intact.  When Slade sees his gravestone, it appears that he was born in 1876- which would make him just over forty in the War Bond scene, and in his mid-fifties in 1933, when the film is supposed to be taking place.  Maybe it's because I'm a history teacher, but this part always bugged me.  Maybe they should have had everyone excited about the Spanish American War of 1898- that would have made a lot more sense, but they would have had to save the scenes with the cars for later. They could have placed the first scene at the end of the Civil War (that would have allowed for some nice props,) making his age in 1933 more believable.  Oh well, great movie."
864,5019281,5,"This is a wonderful movie. It stay faithful to A Christmas Carol, but it very American. A fun movie for one and all."
865,5019281,5,"We love this movie, and the DVD seems to be of very good quality."
866,5019281,5,"One of the best ""Scrooge"" movies, a very creative adaptation."
867,5019281,4,"This is my favorite rendition of the classic Dickens story ""A Christmas Carol.""  Although the versions with George C. Scott and Patrick McNee are also very good, and I watch them at least once every holiday season, they emphasize the British and Victorian aspects of the story.  I am fond of ""An American Christmas Carol"" because it is set during the Depression and shows aspects of American society during that period.  The primary element missing from this version of the story is that Scrooge's sister and, hence, her son (Scrooge's nephew) are missing from this version, presumably in order to fit the original version within a specific time frame.  As a result the story element where the nephew's friends ridicule Scrooge's miserliness, and the corresponding redemptive element after the visitations are missing.  I felt that Henry Winkler performed the role of Scrooge admirably, even though he was only 34 at the time.  Usually the role is performed by an actor of mature years."
868,5019281,5,"I am happy I got to see this and it plays on my UK DVD player.

Mr Slade is as nasty as all the other Scrooges and you can tell who the characters are, Slade is Mr Scrooge and Thatcher is meant to be Bob Cratchet.

I am happy that I got to see this DVD because that is the only Christmas Carol DVD that I have not seen."
869,5019281,4,"Henry Winkler turns in one of the most moving performances he has ever done, and the scenes with this films version of ""Tiny Tim"" will bring a tear, I don't care who you are!

It's become part of our Christmas favorites!"
870,5019281,5,"Loved the movie with Henry Winkler, that aired on TV quite a few years ago.  We always waited every Holiday Season for it to be re-aired, but never saw it again.  It was great finding it on Amazon, and really enjoyed watching this charming movie again."
871,5019281,5,"This is far and away my favorite serious (i.e., not Scrooged) version of A Christmas Carol.  Pre-redemption Benedict Slade is simultaneously worse than Ebeneezer Scrooge, and more believable.  Scrooge is merely cheap, while Slade is actively harming his community, including the very orphanage where he grew up.  Meanwhile, his poor origins make his lifelong aquisitiveness easy to believe.  After the ghosts come, his earlier repossesions allow for a longer and more fun sequence of surprising everyone else with his new self."
872,5019281,5,"If you want the classic version, go with the George C. Scott or Patrick Stewart version. If you want the best family version, go with the Muppet Christmas Carol, which stars Michael Caine and is suprisingly good. But if you want to hear the same old story told in a new, effective setting, get this movie.  As a depression-era American miser whose experiences parallel Scrooge's, Henry Winkler gives a convincing (and at times heart-wrenching) performance. The supporting cast, including Dorian Harewood, also turn in exceptional performances. Nothing in this movie is tacky, anachronistic, overacted, or otherwise out of place - it is as well-crafted a Christmas movie as you can find. And if it leaves you completely untouched, let's just say that you may need some nocturnal visitors to give you Christmas spirit a special ""jump start"" this year.  In short, this movie deserves your family's full attention in the coming Christmas season.  I'm glad it's out on DVD, as we've worn out two videotapes of the show.

Paul Race, editor, Family Garden Trains(tm)"
873,5019281,3,"Mr. Winkler failed to capture my attention in this ignoble version of the classic Dickens fable. However, it isn't without a certain charm all its own. And to Henry's credit, and partly to my own blame, I have never been able to seperate Henry Winkler from the Fonz of Happy Days. I can't say that I disliked the movie it just doesn't rate up there with the Christmas classics in my estimation and this is simply my own personal take on the film.

If you're looking for a Christmas movie that the whole family can enjoy together on occasion then this DVD will fit right in, but if you're looking to gather movies for your library that are the so called ""must have Christmas movies"" then pass it up for another title."
874,5019281,5,"This version of the classic ""A Christmas Carol"" is one of the best.

Henry Winkler is brillant as Benedict Slade and in my opinion this is his most outstanding performance. I watched this movie when it was first released on TV during his Fonzie heyday, and I never once saw that 50's character. He is immersed in his character and is a completely convincing ""Scrooge.""

I'm disappointed that this isn't shown on TV, and I have purchased it so I can enjoy it again and again along with my husband and little girl.

My top three ""A Christmas Carol"" versions star ""A Christmas Carol"" with Alistair Sim, ""Scrooge"" with Albert Finney, and ""An American Christmas Carol"" with Henry Winkler. I won't bother with the others."
875,5019281,4,"This is a version of A Christmas Carol, that most haven't seen.  It is done well and Henry Winkler plays a perfect scrooge.  I love it!"
876,5019281,5,"My wife and I grew up in New Hampshire where this version takes place; so we can easily relate to the characters and setting.  Asside from this, we both really like this version because it places the story in a more comfortable setting in general; early America versus England.

Both spins are great, this just adds to an already powerful Christmas message."
877,5019281,5,This is a great movie...It's a great twist of the original and Henry Winkler does an outstanding job as Mr. Slade.  I love the ending.
878,5019281,4,This classic is even better on dvd.  Great item.  Very happy.
879,5019281,3,"For some reason I always thought this film was older than 1979...in any case this ""American-ized"" version of Dickens' A Christmas Carol stars Henry Winkler as the SCrooge character who is renamed Benedict Slade.  Winkler was at the height of his popularity when this ABC made for TV movie came out so I'm certain that's why he was cast.  Unfortunately you just can't see anything but Fonzie, even under layers and layers of make-up.

The scene is shifted from 1840's London to  Depression-era New England, as miserly businessman Slade receives a long-overdue attitude adjustment one Christmas eve when he is visited by three ghostly figures who resemble three of the people whose possessions Slade had seized to collect on unpaid loans. Assuming the roles of the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future from Charles Dickens' classic story, the three apparitions force Slade to face the consequences of his skinflint ways, and he becomes a caring, generous, amiable man.

In a bit of ridiculousness, the ""Ghost of Christmas Future"" is portrayed by a black man wearing gold chains, dressed in 1979 fashions and listens to disco music. Their ""Ghost of the Future"" jumped a little too far ahead, and is comical by todays standards.

Winkler does an admirable job in his role and Dorian Harewood really shines.  Still...Dickens is a classic...why ABC felt a need to revise something so perfect is beyond me.  This is a good change of pace but if you really like ""A CHristmas Carol"" stick with the Alastair Sim or George C. Scott versions."
880,5019281,5,Io One word WONDERFUL MOVIE Henrey Winkler dose great job in this movie. A movie for the all family to watch if you love him as the fonz you love him as slade (scrooge)
881,5019281,5,Henry Winkler stars in this remake of the classic tale of Scrooge.  This one is set in post-Depression era America and is oneof the best I've ever seen.  Winkler is equally at ease as a young man with a girlfriend or an old man with an attitude.  I watch this every Christmas and was delighted to discover it on DVD.  You'll love it!
882,5019281,5,"Bonjour!
Je crois que de toutes les versions qui ont t faites du conte de Charles Dickens, celle-ci est sans doute  la fois la plus originale et la plus fidle.  Le thme central est bien respect mais l'adaptation est totale puisqu'elle situe l'action en Amrique plutt que dans l'Angleterre du 19e sicle mais avec une touche dbut du sicle et moderne.
Mme si ce film n'est disponible qu'en anglais sur DVD, il vaut la peine d'tre achet puisqu'il n'est plus diffus  la tlvision depuis plusieurs annes suite  une msentente avec le producteur et il semble bien que la situation n'est pas prs de changer.  C'est un film de collection que tous se doivent de possder pour le temps de Nol.  Une version franaise a jadis t disponible mais elle ne l'est plus maintenant ce qui est trs malheureux.  Henry Winkler est remarquable."
883,5019281,5,"Like many other reviewers, I first saw this as a kid on television in '79 and Henry Winkler's ""Fonzie"" persona was still so much a part of the cultural fabric that it was somewhat shocking to even think of him, much less see him, as anything else.
However, I was transfixed by this adaptation on the Dickens story and was genuinely moved by Winkler's ( Benedict Slade ) transformation at the end. Winkler is simply superb: believable, funny, dramatic, and imminently likable even as the curmudgeon. The supporting cast is wonderful as well even though most of them, with the possible exception of David Wayne, will be unknown to most viewers. The actor who plays Thatcher (the ""Cratchit"" character in the Dickens novel) does a wonderful job of being as compassionate as the role demands without being too ""soft"".
The actors playing the roles of Mr. Brewster and Helen Brewster also hold their own and give Winkler solid performances to react to even with limited screen time.
The movie looks and feels like I would imagine turn of the century and Depression era New England to look and feel like to an outsider: quaint, majestic, proud; yet tired and despairing.
My only problem with the movie, and this is REALLY nitpicking, is that they simply made Winkler look too old for the latter Slade (""Scrooge"") part. the movie does an excellenet job of letting us know when things are happening, even in the Christmas Past scenarios, e.g., we know Slade and Helen broke up around 1917 because of the backdrop of the war effort (WW I). The contemporary story is set in 1933 and Slade looks like he has aged forty years instead of only 16 or so. He looks MUCH older than his contemporaries. However, maybe they intended to achieve this effect to accentuate his gnarliness. I just thought it was too much. The only other thing is that many of the actors are obviously Canadian born (Mr. and Mrs. Thatcher and Helen , for example)and several times their Canadian tones and speech patterns come out. This is noticeable particularly against the distinctive New England accents employed throughout the rest of the picture.
I recommend this DVD highly for anyone who loves the Christmas season, the Dickens novel in particular, Henry Winkler, or just any good heartwarming story. I looked for this on DVD and/or VHS for almost twenty years. It was worth the wait."
884,5019281,5,"""A Christmas Carol"" may well be the most-adapted Christmas story in literature, with version ranging from whimsical to musical to deadly serious.  This particular version, starring Henry Winkler as Benedict Slade (a.k.a. Scrooge) is my favorite.
The movie translates Dickens' classic story from 19th century England to Depression-era New England.  The result is very effective.  For me, an American born to parents who grew up in the Depression, the 20th century setting made the story feel very real.  The writers and director made excellent decisions in their choice of sets.  Three notable examples were the New England furniture factory as the setting for Slade's youth, the newly-conceived idea of consumer credit as the source of his subsequent wealth and avarice, and the choice of an African-American as the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come (""You must be Future,"" Slade declares, cowering before him).
Winkler's performance is brilliant.  He captures the essence of Slade perfectly, and makes the gradual transformation from miser to redeemed man seem natural and believable.  The scene at the Thatcher (a.k.a. Cratchit) household at the end of the film never fails to bring tears to my eyes and those of my family.  The supporting cast performs ably as well, making this a Christmas classic that one can watch every year.
""An American Christmas Carol"" debuted in 1979, midway through Winkler's popular ""Happy Days"" television series run.  After a few years of reruns, it disappeared from view until recently, when it became available on DVD and video.  I heartily recommend it for your holiday DVD collection."
885,5019281,5,"First time i saw this movie was 1985 on television. Henry Winkler was excellent! Actually, the whole cast was great. I spent 17 years trying to locate this movie. You won't find it in a video store, at least where i live. And they don't show it on regular t.v. anymore. It is a MUST HAVE if you collect christmas movies."
886,5119367,5,"TNT has put together a surprisingly good account of the Biblical story of  Joseph, betrayed into slavery in Egypt by his jealous brothers.  Martin  Landau as Jacob and Ben Kingsley as Potiphar give their usual first-rate  performances, with the role of Joseph also well-acted.  Leslie-Anne Warren is  the lustful wife of Potiphar, who unsuccessfully tries to seduce Joseph,  and lands him in the Pharoah's prison.  This film offers a very credible  depiction of life in the ancient Near East, from the desert tents of the  Hebrews, to the claustrophobic walled towns like Sichem, to the lushness of  civilized Egypt and the Pharoah's court. The film is faithful to the  Biblical account, and succeeds in making it come alive on the screen.  A  well-acted, well-scripted, and entertaining film.  END"
887,5119367,5,a must see
888,5119367,5,very good
889,5119367,5,Received intact and as expected
890,5119367,5,Love this movie!!!!
891,5119367,4,I was satisfied.
892,5119367,5,perfect
893,5119367,5,Good acting and Biblically accurate.
894,5119367,5,Very good product
895,5119367,4,Nice story
896,5119367,5,"Had this in vhs and HAD to finally get the dvd.  Very well done movie staying pretty true to the biblical telling of Joseph's life. There are a few areas where I would see it differently, but nothing to prevent me from watching this version every couple of years.  The acting is superb and YES, there are SUBTITLES!"
897,5119367,5,"I love the film about Joseph, my favorite Biblical character. This film follows fairly accurately according to the Biblical account."
898,5119367,5,"One of my absolute favorite Christian movies on my shelf.  I try and watch it more than twice a year, and every time, I need Kleenex.  Yep, men use kleenex!  :)"
899,5119367,5,Excellent
900,5119367,5,Was a great addition to the Bible verses and lessons.
901,5119367,3,"It is a shame that such a GODLY movie could be placed in such a CHEAP CASE. The case is so CHEAP it has broken in several places. What I need to know is who are you and ""what planet did you come from"" to be so UNGODLY for money. Because I would have gladly paid extra  for a better movie case.
And if you have a better case get in touch with me, I would like to send out this movie to family and friends......BUT NOT WITH THIS CASE.

Sign: Disappointed"
902,5119367,5,A must see for averyone
903,5119367,1,Many changes / additions!
904,5119367,4,"I actually love this movie and think it is well acted.  However, like another reviewer, I thought there were a couple of scenes about Potiphar's wife's attempts at seduction that were completely gratuitous and stretch what scripture says, hence only 4 stars.  The Bible isn't broken, don't try to fix it.  Every other part is quite wonderful.  I just fast-forward through the unnecessary parts.  Joseph is my favorite character in the Bible, after Jesus of course."
905,5119367,5,Love it!!!
906,5119367,5,Love these movies priceless
907,5119367,5,"I bought this for my Bible study group to watch after we finished our study on Joseph.  Very true to the Bible with some addition of possible details for dramatic effect.  Very well done with good acting. Not amateurish, corny or preachy"
908,5119367,5,"The story of Joseph and his victory over human weakness, enemies and oppression is an inspiring tale beautifully portrayed in the Emmy award winning 1995 miniseries ""Joseph"", with Ben Kingsley as Potiphar and Martin Landau as Jacob.  Excellent performances of jealousy and humanity that leave us rooting for Joseph and his brothers to get what's coming to them!  Life lessons from history that we can still learn from today.  Includes some scenes of violence.  Before showing to teen and younger audiences you might want to preview Scene 3 of Potiphar's wife's attempted seduction and decide if you want to skip it and forward to Scene 4.  Well worth the price with English, Spanish and French subtitles."
909,5119367,5,WELL WRITTEN AND PORTRAYED EVERYONE SHOULD SEE IT
910,5119367,5,Love Bible stories on disc.
911,5119367,5,Great quality. Very good movie.
912,5119367,5,This movie is fantastic! I seen it years ago when it was on VHS and I just purchased it to show my teenage boys. Be prepared to cry. God had his hand on this movie when it was made. The reunion with Joseph and his brothers is a tear jerker and you will ball your head off. This is a story of Gods amazing love and faithfulness towards those of his that are obediant and belong to him.
913,5119367,5,I love it
914,5119367,5,The movie is well made and does the Bible story justice.  A true historical and inspiring story.
915,5119367,5,I really liked this version of Joseph in the Bible Collection. I bought the one in Bible Stories and it was ok but the movie is more down to earth to the events and follows scripture better.
916,5119367,5,Best version
917,5119367,5,"One of my most favorite movies of all time.  Extremely well done.  Some scenes not suitable for younger children.  Otherwise, good Biblical adherence overall.  Tremendous character development."
918,5119367,5,"Amazing movie that perfectly tells the Bible story of Joseph, the actors couldn't be more perfect, it tells the story exactly the way I pictured it!"
919,5119367,2,"I love this DVD, I think it's very much like the way the Bible presents the story  of Jodeph..  Thank you. I wish Hollywood wood make more accurate Bible stories like the story of Joseph."
920,5119367,5,Very well done and accurate for the most partl
921,5119367,5,Good quality. Micheal
922,5119367,5,A great Biblical Movie. A MUST SEE!
923,5119367,5,"A very excellent portrayal of Joseph and his family. Very Biblical and leaves nothing out in this gripping story. I plan to show it to my older great-grandchildren. It's the best story of ""forgiveness"" that can be found."
924,5119367,5,Perfect
925,5119367,5,"Thi is one of my favorite biblical movies I've seen. The message is very close to the bible and the actors do an
 incredible job. I'm glad I purchased this one. I really enjoyed it from the beginning to the end."
926,5119367,5,Excellent format and an engaging adaptation of the life of Joseph. I thoroughly enjoyed it the first time and have played it for my own entertainment many times since then.
927,5119367,5,Very cool
928,5119367,5,"Perfect,Thanks !"
929,5119367,5,"very good movie , you will love it to ."
930,5119367,5,Great movie
931,5119367,5,Awesome movie!
932,5119367,5,Extremely happy.  Thank you very much.
933,5119367,4,"The movie is one of my favorites out of the collection. Not cinematic equalvalence to perfection, but a timeless story that I am more than willing to watch over and over again. I had trouble with the DVD playing and returning to its previous main menu. And I wish the movie had bonus material. However, I am satisfied with the product, i just wish I knew exactly what I was buying to make a richer experience."
934,5119367,5,"A good family movie, very enjoyable, and story was interesting and followed Bible Verses as close as modern day acting would allow."
935,5119367,4,"The lengthy erotic scenes should be  done in better taste..too much!!  Though I realize Scriptures are full of real life encounters more explicit than this to see them in technicolor acted out is too much! In spite of this its an excellent movie Ben Kingsley is always exceptional!  Awesome movie!!! Can't watch this with the children though, of couse you could fast-forward past it."
936,5119367,5,I LOVE this movie...Love everything about it....
937,5119367,5,Package & DVD were in excellent condition.  The movie was awesome!!  Thank you so much.
938,5119367,5,Great Bibically based movie.
939,5119367,5,True to biblical narrative.
940,5119367,5,good movie
941,5119367,5,Very much
942,5119367,3,it's okay
943,5119367,1,For being a Christian movie I felt they went to far with the scenes between Joseph and  Potiphar's wife. I gave it one star because you have to but I would not give it any or recommend it to Christians. I actually took mine out and burnt it.
944,5119367,5,Thank you!!!
945,5119367,2,"If you gave this a high rating. It was for being a great HOLLYWOOD Production.. If you read the BIBLE you will find out Joseph was quite the opposite. It's in a small part a Christian movie. I can't see God pleased with exploiting sex scenes. If the Hollywood director when by the bible it would have raved reviews. It goes to show you how many BIBLE read the bible and how many never have opened one, going by all this Five star ratings."
946,5119367,5,THE BEST GREAT
947,5119367,5,Love this movie
948,5119367,5,I love it! I have been searching for years for this movie. Ever since I was I little child it has been and will always be my favorite movie and now regular TV or any of the satellite or cable doesn't show it. Years of trying to buy or even purchase it on iTunes was exhausting but I never gave up looking. Then a family member asked if I had tried Amazon and with tears of JOY I found it. THANK YOU!
949,5119367,5,Very good movie
950,5119367,5,Love this DVD.  I can't seem to get it back from people I've loaned it to as they love it too!
951,5119367,5,Love this movie like to watch it and learn from it.
952,5119367,5,This is the best portrayal of biblical events that I've run across.  The cast is excellent and they stick to the story as told in the Bible.  This should be required viewing for those wishing to understand the story of Joseph.
953,5119367,5,Loved it.
954,5119367,5,EXCELLENT!
955,5119367,5,Great story well told.
956,5119367,5,"I believe this to be the best depiction of this, my absolutely favorite Biblical character!  The story moves forward accurately, in accordance with Scriptures.  Each role is superbly cast.  Staging is incredible.  I am not a pushover when it comes to reviews, so these glowing words are quite rare for me.  I have watched this movie probably five times (both on TV and DVD), and each time, I find something new."
957,5119367,1,"I'm not particularly religious and have nothing against X-rated movies.  This is an okay movie.  I just think that you should never watch this movie with young kids.

I watched it with my two daughters, 11 and 8, and it was an embarrassment.

There are 2 rapes, in which the women yell in pain.

There are about 35 murders with knives.  The scenes are not very bloody, but it is still terrible to see a bunch of lunatics killing dozens of people.  My 11 year old was so sickened that she left the room.

There's is a fairly explicit sex scene with a prostitute, which ends up being an incest.

There's frequent reference to prostitutes and to man going to bed with women.

Potiphar's wife behaves in a few scenes as in an x rated movie, her face shows extreme sexual desire, she touches Joseph in very explicit way, including touching his penis.  The scene does not show sexual parts of course, but her hand goes down pretty deep.  She invites him to sleep with her a few times.

There are several extremely offensive references to women, like ""they talk to much"" or ""they gossip.""

Again, the movie is okay and the sex scenes did not offend me.  My problem is that the movie is not rated and it should be at least PG13.  I wish I had not watched that movie with my two daughters.  I am upset."

959,5119367,5,"I first saw this movie on TBN.  I loved the movie and had been unable to find it anywhere.  Went looking on Amazon, and surprise. I found it.  I purchased it, and I have never looked back.  Very Good!"
960,5119367,5,"All I can say it's great, especially if you own this Bible collection. Have a blessed year, God Bless"
961,5119367,5,Great
962,5119367,2,My fault I didn't realize it was VHS so it's nice to have but what I was looking
963,5119367,5,Just what i was locking for!
964,5119367,5,This is a very favorite movie.  I truly enjoy watching this movie over and over and over again.
965,5119367,5,"Who would have thought Turning Broadcasting would put out an interesting, uplifting, and entertaining classic on the Bible story of Joseph?  And yet this movie hits all these points.  The primary characters all submit strong performances, and Joseph's character comes off as both humble and Godly, while keeping the essential truths of the Biblical narrative intact.  We have seen it about 4 times and enjoyed it every time.  Get it, you'll like it."
966,5119367,5,Great movie
967,5119367,5,"This was a made for TV movie, that I watched when it was aired.  I love this story from the Bible.  It is so interesting and has such a good message for all of us.  This is the best production of this story that I've ever seen.  It is very thorough and emotional. A must see for everyone."
968,5119367,5,I just watched this movie and follows the Torah very closely.  the acting and sets were really great to look at.
969,5119367,4,"The price tripled from two weeks ago. It is a good movie, good actors, and acting,  and pretty true to the bible story of Joseph and his brothers. But  it is not right that they increase the price so much. So I will wait until it goes back down to get another one."
970,5119367,5,Excellent Movie!
971,5119367,5,Great acting and even better story of betrayal family and redemption.
972,5119367,5,"Like Joseph, many lives are lived from one tragedy to the next as learning, reshaping, the and the molding process of God takes place. But when it's time for these servants to come forth into the lives they have been trained for, they do shine with God's favor and glory on them, indeed!"
973,5119367,5,"One of the best bible movies, that stayed close to the authenticity of the bible."
974,5119367,5,"FABULOUS!!! The story of Joseph is one our absolute favorites. We love to be able to watch on DVD and see his story unfold. How he started in such dire circumstances and how God brought him up and out of them to save all of Egypt and his entire family as well fulfilling prophecy by the Power of God. I would highly recommend buying this DVD and sharing it with other friends, believers, and non-believers. Praise God and His Son Jesus."
975,5119367,5,Love this movie. Fast delivery.
976,5119367,5,Great Bible story I had to see agaig.

982,5119367,5,It's great!!! :)
983,5119367,5,Good movie
984,5119367,5,Happy that it was the best version of this story...
985,5119367,5,"Very close to the story of Genesis.  If you ever wondered how the Israelites ended up in bondage, this gives you the history."
986,5119367,5,Tv version edits so much! This exceeded my expectations :)
987,5119367,2,"I Didn't like this movie. I will keep and add it to my collection..This movie hit a soft spot with me it's about jealousy something a lot of people have had against me my whole life even family members. This movie was really sad I cried at the end because I couldn't hold myself any longer, and I'm a very strong woman..Joseph brothers sold him into slavery because their father favored him. Joseph had several brothers who sinned in the eyes of GOD, so their father favored Joseph because he was the youngest and most righteous. That enraged his brothers they trapped young Joseph and was going to leave him for dead then Egyptians came along the brothers decided to sell him into slavery instead....I didn't see any nudity in the movie. I decided to write that because I read some reviews that talked about nudity I didn't see no nudity in Joseph.......I purchased 3 movies.......David..........Abraham & Joseph....I rate #1David.....#2 Abraham..#3 Joseph..I liked David the most..."
988,5119367,5,Enjoyed very much.
989,5119367,1,"Even tho it states bible collection it might as well have been sold in the back of a xxx video shop, the women wear see through clothes, and they might have worn these in period but they could have worn under ware under them, I would not recommend this video to anyone....."
990,5119367,5,Love this movie and so does my husband. It never gets old!
991,5119367,5,I enjoyed this version of Joseph because it seamlessly weaves the depiction related in the Bible.  It is very entertaining too!
992,5119367,5,love it
993,5119367,5,"I have watched this film so many times that I cannot count.  Joseph provides a thoughtful look at a man of God who goes through betrayal, slavery, slander, imprisonment.  In the end, his faithfulness to God and his forgiving spirit are rewarded when I becomes the second most powerful man in ancient Egypt."
994,5119367,5,Excellent
995,5119367,5,One of my favorite movies and one of the best depictions of the life of Joseph!
996,5119367,5,So good!
997,5119367,5,Love this movie. Have watched it several times.
998,5119367,5,"We really like this version on Joseph. We do have other versions also, but this is our favorite."
999,5119367,5,I simply LOVE this story. Is so beautifully done. They must of spent a fortune with the sets and costumes. In my opinion even better than the settings used in Cleopatra (with Elizabeth Taylor) Very good acting as well. Worth buying and the message is tremendous.
1000,5119367,5,Great acting good seller
1001,5119367,5,One of the best Bible production movies out there.
1002,5119367,5,Received as promised.
1003,5119367,5,"Beautifully reenacted account of Jacob, Joseph and the rest of his sons and family. This DVD powerfully captures the heart and sole of a true, Godly man. Including the victories and trials and tribulations that even good men must face in life."
1004,5119367,5,"Loved the film, will enjoy it over and over!"
1005,5119367,4,Really good movie
1006,5119367,5,Great movie!
1007,5119367,5,"First watched this as a teenager in youth group at church.  Was happy to find the 2-cassette VHS version a few years ago.  Am now happy to have it on DVD for continued enjoyment.

This tells the story of the Biblical character Joseph, from his days as a young shepherd, to being sold by his brothers into slavery in Egypt, to becoming the second-most-powerful man in Egypt and an eventual reunion with his family.  It's a well done production that brings the story to life."
1008,5119367,5,One of my favorite biblical stories ever. I love this movie. The quality of the package was beyond safe and arrived right on time
1009,5119367,5,I purchased this as a Christmas gift.

1020,5119367,5,Best ever.
1021,5119367,5,"The story of Joseph was my grandfathers favorite story and his grandchildren heard him recount the details weekly. This ""Joseph"" DVD is quite long, 3+ hours but worth every minute. My favorite by far of this series on Old Testament characters. You will not be disappointed."
1022,5119367,5,Awesome
1023,5119367,5,I have loved this movie from the first time I saw it.  I am so glad that I was able to get it.

1027,5119367,5,"This movie is so totally, wonderfully, Biblically accurate!  It puts the emotion into the story of Joseph and allows you to literally FEEL what he must have experienced.  Wonderfully done and so very moving."
1028,5119367,5,Great movie!!!
1029,5119367,5,"How can you not love the story of Joseph! I ordered 2 copies, one for me, another for my best friend. We enjoyed the DVD"

1031,5119367,5,A must watch Bible Collection DVD
1032,5119367,5,"Stunning. Obviously you should read the Bible first and after, to know what happened and compare, but this is close enough and done very well. Love the music!!!!"
1033,5119367,4,Seen it previously on TBN had it recorded to my DVR but I want it for my DVD and Blue Ray collection. Very biblical accurate and an excellaant production for Christians who want The Promise ( Old Testament) preview of the life of Christ Jesus.
1034,5119367,5,all good ty
1035,5119367,5,"excellent, I learned a lot"
1036,5119367,5,Hands down my favorite Bible movie

1042,5119367,5,Excellent movie. Highly recommend.
1043,5119367,3,Good Video
1044,5119367,5,One of the best Christian movies I have ever seen.  Long but very impressionable.  It builds faith.
1045,5119367,5,satisfied
1046,5119367,4,Watched at least a dozen times and never lacked a good version of the bible story line of the true Joseph and his love for God.
1047,5119367,5,"One of my favorite movies. They did an excellent job of staying true to the story. As you watch this movie you are reminded of the faith AND patience of Joseph. If anyone in history had a reason to throw his hands up and declare that God had forgotten him it was Joseph, yet he remained faithful. The full story is told, even the account of Judah and Tamar which ended up in the birth of the root of the kingly line of Israel. Virtually everything was portrayed and accurately so. To me, the main point they really nailed was how Joseph woke up one day, still a prisoner, and by sunset he was the second most powerful man on the face of the Earth. This led to another fantastic lesson, Joseph all of a sudden had all the power anyone could want and while today we see people desire power so they can lord it over those beneath them and settle old scores, Joseph instead showed compassion. He could have easily destroyed his brothers or a least made them suffer as he had suffered but instead he displayed true character.... a lesson many in positions of power today could learn from. The story of Joseph is one of the most remarkable in Biblical history and rightly so.
You can spend your hard earned dollars with confidence when you buy this movie and you will want to either loan it to others or buy it for them as a gift. It's too bad that more movies of this quality are made, especially when you consider all the technology that is available."
1048,5119367,5,Great
1049,5119367,5,great
1050,5119367,5,i love this movie exellent service

1054,5119367,5,I love this movie.
1055,5119367,5,My favorite Joseph movie ever....
1056,5119367,5,"A wonderful story that is just very well done. Good acting, Ben Kingsley and the cast are just perfect in each of their roles. Beautiful footage of what the Holy Land must have looked like, no matter Where it was taken. The richness of the period costumes, customs, attitudes and the connection of the people to the land itself and to kin. All the details appeared to be nicely taken care of"
1057,5119367,5,good movie
1058,5119367,5,great movie
1059,5119367,5,GREAT

1069,5119367,5,This is a beautiful story of faith in God.  I have been wanting to purchase this for some time.  I 'm  glad you had it.
1070,5119367,5,Received

1072,5119367,5,"This was a very good movie. It didn't have a lot of exaggeration in it, and was very much like the story recorded in the Bible."
1073,5119367,5,"whats not to love, Ben Kingsley!!!!!!"
1074,5119367,5,Fast delivery. Awesome movie!
1075,5119367,5,MY Favorite bible story.
1076,5119367,5,Thanks for everything.
1077,5119367,5,Loved the movie!!!
1078,5119367,5,"You'll love every minute of this three hour movie. Filmed in Morocco, this treatment of the rags to riches biblical story explores the political intrigue of Joseph's polygamous family and subsequently the Egyptian court. Joseph has long been regarded as a forerunner of Jesus, and the movie alludes to this similarity several times. In fact, Joseph's story is an Old Testament illustration of Jesus' observation that ""no prophet is accepted in his own country,"" (Luke 4:24). Joseph's talent for interpreting dreams provokes his brothers to sell him into slavery, but the same talent proves enormously profitable for him in Egypt.

Perhaps the most relevant connection between the 1995 movie and the present time is the debate over prosperity theology, which proposes that one can enjoy God's blessings --particularly health and wealth-- on earth. Joseph, as portrayed by the athletic Paul Mercurio, is certainly capable of fighting back against his oppressors, but instead of physical aggression, he chooses to assert himself through faith, talent, honesty, and impressive political courage --attributes which eventually earn him riches in Egypt.

Followers of prosperity theology are seen by some Christians as heretics who love money, but the Joseph movie is an epic struggle for the good life, and it raises larger questions. Don't most Christians work for a better life? Don't they repeat refrains, such as ""God helps those who help themselves"" and ""When opportunity knocks, answer the door""? Is the ascetic life advocated by the Bible practical or even responsible in the postmodern world? Was Joseph as a long suffering slave morally superior to Joseph as a rich governor who saved Egypt and its neighbors from death by famine? Several biblical characters have inspired many an inspirational film, but the Joseph movie strikes at the heart of money's problematic role in Christian life."
1079,5119367,5,"This is my favorite Paul Mercurio movie.  As Joseph he is a truly unharnessed character whose angst is so deep, visually apparent and so complete that we are free to empathize with him. The multi dimensional emotional conflict from within the character is so palpable that it
develops its own spiritual presence in the hot tub seduction scene.  And, the gentle, sweet, forgiving demeanor of Joseph when he reveals
himself to his brothers at the end just ties the story together and brings it to a close with an all encompassing forceful power that is just so
refreshing.  No violence, no revenge, just powerful forgiveness mixed with a dash of gratitude for the end resulting exalted / elevated status
that resulted from his brothers' betrayal.  I love using this movie to learn languages.  The layered emotion and richness makes it, for me, a movie classic.  I think Paul Mercurio movies in general are great language learning tools.  They are so interesting that I don't mind watching them many times.  And, watching anything more than once is a rare occurrence for me.  I initially saw this movie on a religious channel so
the hot tub scene was edited out due to its sexy content.  It is a very crucial part of the movie, however."
1080,5119367,5,Thank You
1081,5119367,5,I love this movie!  Very true to the biblical account of Joseph.  I'm moved every time I watch it  Especially where Joseph forgives his brothers!
1082,5119367,5,Great Movie.
1083,5119367,5,"Great movie, I have watched it probably 8 times"
1084,5119367,5,Excellent video
1085,5119367,1,Very good movie
1086,5119367,5,I have the VCR so its nice to have the DVD now. Exellent movie and well written.
1087,5119367,5,Very Good movie  is in good condition  thanks

1089,5119367,5,"I absolutely enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to all and especially to ""believers"" in Christ!!!"
1090,5119367,5,"I bought this for a friend who asked me to get it for her. She adores this movie and we have watched it together many times.  Scripturally accurate, which is rare."
1091,5119367,5,"Great product, Fair pricing."
1092,5119367,5,Wonderful account of the Biblical/historical account of Joseph.  We have watched it several times.
1093,5119367,5,Good biblical interpretation and good acting!! Loved it! The story of Joseph is one of my favorite stories in the Bible.
1094,5119367,5,I like this move. I watched about 15 times or more
1095,5119367,2,"Way tooooo much Potiphar.  You'd think he was a primary mover and shaker in this story.  He was a literary device.  Ben must have needed an ego boost or something.  As to the story of Dinah, well much license has been taken to tell a story which has no chronological placement in the Jacob/Joseph story."
1096,5119367,5,"We have watched this series over and over.  We had to get a second disc, as we lent our previous one out - never to return. But no matter.  It is such a well done, a follows the Scriptures well, that it was one we want to always have on our shelf ... even if we have to buy a third."
1097,5119367,5,gift
1098,5119367,2,"This ""Not Rated"" version is NOT family-friendly! Don't watch it with the kids!"
1099,5119367,5,This item is what I ordered and I am a very satisfied customer
1100,5119367,5,Second best biblical movie I ever saw.
1101,5119367,4,Enjoyed the movie and very close to his story. The ending was weak and kind of left us hanging.
1102,5119367,5,Great video!
1103,5119367,5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!
1104,5119367,5,Love the the story it's good for anyone to watch how forgiving brothers and sisters should be in the name of The Lord all those tapes I brought it's for the people at the Church to watch together .
1105,5119367,5,This is one of the greatest Bible stories ever shot on film. Ben Kingsley is an outstanding actor and does a wonderful job. He should win a Lifetime Achievement Award.
1106,5119367,4,love biblical moves.
1107,5119367,4,Good movie!
1108,5119367,5,good movie
1109,5119367,5,one of the best movies of bible stories ever made
1110,5119367,5,Great production and great acting.  All time classic.  Must have for your library
1111,5119367,5,Bought for my mom as a gift because she really likes this production and actors in this .
1112,5119367,5,Best movie of Joseph I've ever seen! Sticks to the Bible so closely! The actors play their parts to the letter. Brought tears to my eyes many times!!
1113,5119367,5,Wow!  Fast and perfect packaging.  I'm always amazed when folks do what they promise and more.  I'd rate this one as A+.  Thanks!
1114,5119367,5,"EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!!  It is very well done, and I watch this movie over and over again.  Price was good and speedy shipping.  thumbs up to the seller"
1115,5119367,5,"Excellent casting, acting.  Very true to scripture."
1116,5119367,5,Well done.
1117,5119367,5,great story line
1118,5119367,5,"I did not purchase this video but rented it. This is absolutely the best movie rendition of a Bible story I have ever watched. It faithfully sticks to the Biblical account of Joseph and his brethren and father. A few scenes were added that are not in the Bible, but these did not detract from the narrative; they added continuity and were plausible scenarios. This film respected both God and the Bible. I have nothing negative to say about it. I highly recommend this film to the believer and the unbeliever. It is both entertaining and factual."
1119,5119367,5,"I love a good Bible story. Joseph is one of the greatest Old Testament character. Good quality,great price and excellent service. THANK YOU!!"
1120,5119367,5,"Excellent retelling of the Bible story of Joseph. His faith in the Lord God Jehovah is front and center, unlike so many so-called Biblical movies. Ben Kingsley as Potiphar -- Paul Mercurio as Joseph -- and Martin Landau as Jacob -- all just superb.  The actors have British accents and many of them have blue eyes -- but that's ok.  The scene where the brothers have thrown Joseph into the pit rings very true - surely it really was very similar to that. This will be a movie I will watch again and again."
1121,5119367,5,love it
1122,5119367,5,I love this movie.  Just watch it!
1123,5119367,5,A very good telling of the story of Joseph. Good cinematography and acting. The Pharoh and family seemed too young. Ben Kingsley's acting was excellent in this film.
1124,5119367,5,Great movie! Exactly what I wanted!! A+++++++++
1125,5119367,5,GREAT  PARALLED TO THE  BIBLES  ACCOUNT.
1126,5119367,5,This accurate representation of Joseph from the book of Genesis is the best biblical film I have ever seen. I have watched it since my childhood and still cry from the compelling story of beautiful faithfulness. This is a well done film. Ben Kingsley is the perfect Potiphar and every other cast member was perfect as well. Watch this movie! It is soooooo GOOD!
1127,5119367,5,This Movie is absolutely awesome
1128,5119367,5,I love this story!!
1129,5119367,5,GREAT Teaching Movie very accurate with the BIBLE
1130,5119367,5,Best Christian Movie
1131,5119367,5,Wonderful to watch. I love this particular movie.
1132,5119367,5,"Great movie and good adaptation of the biblical account of the life of Joseph. There are times when Hollywood takes EXTREME licenses with biblical stories, transforming them into something unrecognizable (i.e. Noah).  However, that is not the case with Joseph.  The movie stays very close to the biblical account with some minor addition added to enhance the story and to drive home a point.  It effectively demonstrated how God can take a circumstance that to us can seem evil and use to bring about good.  As for those people who were offended by the ""bath scene"", I say read story from Genesis again.  Potiphar's  wife pressured Joseph DAY AFTER DAY for sex. In order for the movie to drive this home effectively without being pornographic, it showed her attempting to seduce him while he was bathing.  Now the although this can be inappropriate for younger viewers, the reality is that it does not deviate drastically from the biblical account and it does not warrant the movie a bad review.  I'll tell anyone with very small children not to watch this with them until they are of an age where you are ready to talk to them about sexual issues.  The Bible is fill with stories of suffering, lost, pain, and redemption and sometimes these topics are hard to see on film.  But it would be an injustice to the Word of God if they were completely omitted."
1133,5119367,5,"Joseph is a TV movie that tells the story of Joseph from the Old Testament. It stars Paul Mercurio in the title role.
This is Biblical, well-acted, and the filmmakers are to be praised for the sound Biblical research. Although some of the sexually explicit scenes,it should be screened from the very young. It is an ideal platform from which teens can search out characteristics of moral uprightness in Joseph. The performances were great. Mercurio does an admirable job. The only flaw I could find in it is that it isn't powerful as other Biblical films and TV movies. But nevertheless, it still tells a good story of a man who never lost faith in the Lord amidst all the trials and sufferings that he experienced before achieving success in life."
1134,5119367,5,"great, a must see."
1135,5119367,5,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE

5 STARS"
1136,5119367,5,Awesome!!!!
1137,5119367,5,This is an AWESOME movie!  Highly recommend.  Great for the entire family.
1138,5119367,5,Inspirational and uplifting.
1139,5119367,5,"Good re-enactment of Bible history. This is not a cheesy movie. Good acting by well-known performers. Maybe not 2015 technology but still excellent cinematography, etc. Entertaining and educational."
1140,5119367,5,The program was as described.  It arrived promptly.
1141,5119367,5,great
1142,5119367,5,great movie
1143,5119367,5,"This is a must have for any biblical tape collection.  It was well written and directed.  For the performers, I give them an A+."
1144,5119367,4,"Not many mini-series today about the Old Testament that can capture and interest a large audience base. Worth checking out. As always, Ben Kingsley does a wonderful job, even as a supporting actor."
1145,5119367,5,This series of biblical films are really quite good.  Not totally accurate to scripture but the presentations are good.
1146,5119367,5,"Lots of fabrication, but we don't really know the whole story. It helps to envision beyond the written page."
1147,5119367,5,A true classic in every word.  This is a must for biblical video collections.  But with an all star cast how could you go wrong.  They did a great job staying true to the Word as well.
1148,5119367,5,pleased with purchase
1149,5119367,1,Same as Moses and Abraham
1150,5119367,5,awesome
1151,5119367,5,Outstanding film!
1152,5119367,5,Great bible story worth watching and learning the story/events.
1153,5119367,5,Exvcellent
1154,5119367,5,One of the best presentations of the Joseph story. I use this with my middle school Sunday school class every year. Attendance is always at the max. I show 20 minutes and then we discuss what they saw. Great file.
1155,5119367,5,"This epic, motion picture - JOSEPH, starring Actor: Paul Mercurio in the title role, is an engaging, true life, biblical drama straight from the Old Testament/Book of Genesis within the Holy Bible (See Genesis 30:22-24; 37:1-36 & 39:1-50:26). Written for television by: Lionel Chetwynd, this 1995 film which also features... not one, but two Academy Award winning Actors: Sir Ben Kingsley as 'Potiphar' and Martin Landau as 'Jacob', also won the prestigious Emmy Award for: ""Outstanding Miniseries."" And, although it focuses on the life of JOSEPH, it also chronicles the latter life of his father Jacob, together with his wives, his concubines, his only sister - Dinah, and the lives of his brothers, as well. From the popular ""Bible Collection"" Films of which (at this date), there are 13 available, Turner Pictures presents a Lube Production in association with Lux Beta Films and Rai Uno in presenting this disturbing yet deeply moving and climactic film: JOSEPH, in it's entirety. All, 187-minutes of it. This compelling, motion picture/miniseries, vividly depicts the willful, calculated and brutal betrayal of 17-year old JOSEPH, the 11th son of 12 brothers. Who, was maliciously sold into slavery, to appease their jealousy of him. What are older brothers for, eh?! So why..., were they so cruel and viciously envious of JOSEPH? Because he was their father's obvious favorite (Genesis 37:3-4). Sibling rivalry? Oh yeah! And, then some!! In viewing this captivating drama, one cannot help but wonder..., how it helped JOSEPH's brother's to be so jealous of him? And what did they hope to accomplish with their continued envy, scorn and contempt towards their innocent, younger brother? It certainly wasn't going to change their father's love for him. Neither, would it change the fact, that JOSEPH was the long awaited, first-born son of Jacob's favorite wife, Rachel. Nor would it diminish their feelings of paternal rejection, deep seated inadequacies and personal insecurities from which, acute jealousy, stems. But, aside from his younger brother Benjamin, his only sibling by the same mother (Rachel), the 10 older brothers and their level of jealousy towards him escalated too such a fever pitch, that initially they literally plotted to murder JOSEPH. But, due to the sanity and shrewdness of the one brother, they opted to throw him into a cold, dry, well, complete with snakes. The following morning, they literally sold him..., to Ishmaelite Slave Traders for 20 pieces of silver. Talk about betrayal, treachery, deviousness, jealousy and abject hatred! Again, was there any brotherly love, here? No way! And, they all made a profit from literally..., selling out his person. So how, did their acute jealousy help anything? It didn't. From the on-set, jealousy of another breeds resentment and hostility. Unbridled, it only suffices to kill and destroy. In this particular case, blatant deceit combined with needless treachery together with their murderous envy, sheer hatred and concealment of their vile crime, manifested itself in a heinous betrayal against their own brother. And, as if that weren't enough, they further added insult to injury by deliberately lying too their father, Jacob. How? By corporately telling him the tale, that JOSEPH was dead and gone. Because he supposedly, was killed by a wild animal. And, they 'offered' his blood stained coat which Jacob had made for him, as ""proof."" Meanwhile, JOSEPH... who was very much alive, was re-sold in Egypt by the Ishmaelite Slave Traders, to Potiphar - the Captain of the Pharaoh's Guard. So, as far as the envious brother's were concerned, JOSEPH was seemingly out of the picture and doomed to the wretched existence of a slave. And for years, such was the case. And Jacob, having lost his favorite son, along with his pride and joy upon whom all of his hopes of leading the family clan were founded, continued to grieve for his thought to be dead, son. Because when you truly love someone, their absence only makes the heart grow fonder. The years wore on..., and JOSEPH grew to become very handsome. He was a man of excellence and integrity, who knew how to read and write (most slaves didn't), and one who carried himself in a humble manner. As was pleasing to his master, Potiphar. However, for as much as Potiphar trusted JOSEPH... to the point that he elevated him to be his personal assistant and household accountant, so too, did Potiphar's' promiscuous wife (as portrayed by Actress: Lesley Ann Warren) decide, that she would take advantage of the situation and use JOSEPH's strong, attractive, physique for her own sexual pleasure. But, there was only one problem. JOSEPH refused to sleep with her. And she, incensed at having her advances rejected by a mere slave, spitefully and vindictively accused him of a most heinous crime. Rape. (Yup! All of this..., sex and all, is really within the Holy Bible. And, at the beginning of this review, you were provided with: Chapter, scripture and verse(s), so you can read it for yourself). So, what happened to JOSEPH? Well, having heard that his wife was supposedly raped, Potiphar stripped JOSEPH of his position and status, and further placed him into Pharaoh's prison. Where common thieves, cut throat's and all sorts of criminals are kept. Hardly the place, for an innocent and educated man, like JOSEPH. A man of breeding and integrity. However, just as Potiphar was impressed with the way JOSEPH carried himself and handled his assigned duties, so too, was the prison warden into whose prison care, JOSEPH was placed. To the point, that he elevated JOSEPH to the position of prison overseer, who was in charge of all the other prisoners. Years went by, and then came the fateful day when two of Pharaoh's employee's - a wine bearer and a baker, were placed into prison under JOSEPH's care. Utilizing his gift that the Lord had given to him (that of interpreting dreams), JOSEPH correctly foretold the dreams of both, the baker and the wine bearer. Specifically, that the wine bearer would be reinstated into Pharaoh's employ and that the baker would die in prison. It came to pass just as JOSEPH had stated, and having been restored, the wine bearer remembered and told Pharaoh about JOSEPH, when Pharaoh's' court see's could not interpret Pharaoh's dreams. JOSEPH was summoned to Pharaoh's Court and after hearing and accurately predicting the dreams of the Pharaoh, he was rewarded and promoted to the position of Governor of all, Egypt. Second only, to Pharaoh himself. Believe it! And what, became of JOSEPH's brother's? Well, suffice it to say, that the rest of this powerful drama is a story of forgiveness, healing, reconciliation and restoration. And yes, JOSEPH's brother's got a lesson that they wouldn't soon forget! This is a deeply moving, epic, biblical drama that comes to it's audience in color, on a single-disc, DVD in spoken English in 4.0 Dolby Digital Surround Sound and also, in 2.0 Dolby Digital Spanish. With subtitles in English, Spanish and French. And shows in full screen format for approximately 187-minutes. To say the least, it is a very interesting motion picture that does much more, than just entertain. It deals with human drama in relation too the God, that created..., mankind (See Genesis 1:2-28 & 2:21-25). Nina Kish"
1156,5119367,5,"This is amazing, a true count from the bible.  Joseph was perfect and Ben Kingsley as  Potifar was great."
1157,5119367,5,"Regarding Biblical movies, this one and the Ten Commandments with Charles Heston are really the closet scripture related movies that I have seen.  This movie is 3 hours long and I have already watched it 2 times and could watch it over and over again.  It it an excellent movie and I would not hesitate to recommend this movie to be seen by anyonr and everyone.  It really shows how God will provide for his people if only they would put him first and worhip no other Gods.  A God can be anything that you put first and foremost before the only One and True Living God who created this earth and everything in it.  If we just follow Him, he will provide and actually go beyond just meeting our needs, but will give us the desires of our hearts.  Our first desire must be to serve, and love our God of Abraham, Jacob and Issac with all our minds, hearts and souls.  No other Gods are allowed to be worshipped as the God I serve is a jealous God.  You cannot serve two masters and expect to spend eternity in Heaven with the Lord our Risen Saviour.  Please get this and watch it and I am sure you will see what I am talking about and agree. An Excellent Movie. I have seen a few other Bible Related movies and they were very good also, but this one is one of my favorites."
1158,5119367,5,forgiveness..that says it all.
1159,5119367,5,Good
1160,5119367,3,"Walking you through the wonderful story of Joseph, this movie makes it personal and connects the Biblical truths to your own life and purpose."
1161,5119367,5,I would recommend this collection. Good stories
1162,5119367,5,enjoyed a lot
1163,5119367,5,This is an excellent production concerning Joseph who was sold into Egypt. The acting is excellent and the sets are as well. I bought 9 of these DVDs to give to my children and to add to our collection. I would completely recommend this DVD.
1164,5119367,5,no comment
1165,5119367,5,It brought the Bible Story to life.
1166,5119367,5,"Genesis actually comes to life again in this adaption of the life of ""Joseph"". Being well versed in scripture, I'm usually a tad weary of most anything that Hollywood has to offer when adapting from ""The Holy Book"". What a relief and pleasure it's been to see this film. The story of Joseph is one of my personal favorite accounts told from the Old Testament. What a delight it was to see this wonderful tale done so faithfully and true. And yes, the ending of this film shall bring tears to one's eyes. For any who are not familiar with scripture, then see this film. Any who does read scripture, as I do, then see this film as well. God Bless always."
1167,5119367,5,"Great mini-series. Really like the story, characters and quality of the acting."
1168,5119367,4,"The whole story of Joseph is not well known, but this video tells it well.  The suspense of the family dynamics are very intense.  It would be nice if families today could be so forgiving."
1169,5119367,4,"Well should easily be a 5 star, but knowing Hollywood they had to make it just a touch resque when Potiphar's wife is temping Joseph.  If they had left that out, it wouldn't have hurt the movie a bit and would have been a clear 5 star and probably gotten the Dove seal. Still very good and accurate as well as detailed and entertaining."
1170,5119367,5,"This movie has a 5 star rating for a reason!  There are already enough thoughtful, detailed reviews here so I don't feel the need to add another one, but I wanted to throw my hat in the ring with a rating because the movie deserves it.  I own it and have probably watched it a dozen times; I am moved with every viewing and am encouraged in my faith.  It does a magnificent job of bringing the story to life.

Regarding the title of my review... yes, the bath scene went too far for me to condone (no nudity, but extremely suggestive) and it is admittedly a cringe-worthy few minutes for a bible based movie; I won't try to justify it, but since I've overlooked (and fast-forwarded through) plenty of more explicit scenes in secular movies, I'd be a hypocrite to denounce this film because of it.  If you have a very strict, zero tolerance policy for anything sexually suggestive in a movie, then my recommendation would be that you pass on this one."
1171,5119367,5,"Love this entire series. Joseph is very accurate to the Bible. Easy to watch and follow. Great way to teach the biblical section on Joseph, as it brings the words to life."
1172,5119367,5,"Despite its long running time, this is one of my favorite movies.  The cast, the scenery, the acting and the story are all first rate.  The irony of the ending is delicious.  I have watched it many times and will watch it many more.  highly recommended."
1173,5119367,4,A nice alternative to the classic. Can be used to get the point across but it is different that the Bible in some points
1174,5119367,5,This version I liked. Went behind the scenes. Not totally accurate but great version of this story.
1175,5119367,5,One of my all time favorite movies!
1176,5119367,5,"One of the best depictions of the Biblical account of Joseph.  The acting is convincing and well done, and keeps you focused to the end."
1177,5119367,5,"Beautifully conceived and executed.  Coherently re-cast in flash-backs.  Realistic sets and costumes but ultimately emotionally satisfactory and believable.  Well-acted, well imagined, faithful to the Biblical recounting.  A worthwhile endeavor."
1178,5119367,5,"I read the Bible quite often and teach Bible classes from time to time. This is a very accurate account of the ""Joseph"" story."
1179,5119367,5,This film is one of the better films made about stories of the Bible.  Very little poetic license was taken with it - they stuck to the scripture very closely and Sir Ben Kingsley is brilliant at Potipher.
1180,5119367,5,I have seen this movie several times and bought it because I liked it so much.  This version has good acting and goes into more detail about Joseph's brothers and their thoughts and actions than similar movies I've seen.  My favorite part is when Joseph reveals to his brothers who he really is.  I cry every time.  Movie arrived quickly and as promised.
1181,5119367,5,"I must admit this bibical movie has it all. Passion,Suspense and Temptation. I think this is more for a mature audience. Due to some scenes in this film I wouldnt advise children to view it. But the cast and movie is wonderful. It's truly a movie worth watching!"
1182,5119367,5,"This is one of my most favorite stories in the Bible, recommend this one to anyone who loves a good Bible story."
1183,5119367,5,Had a great experience! Will possibly consider buying from again. Great work great work great work great work great work.
1184,5119367,5,I own a lot of Bible stories from this series on CD. This one is particularly good. You can't beat the Holy Bible for great story lines!
1185,5119367,5,The movie was very informative and accurate to the Bible. I was part of a study about Joseph with a small group from church and we ended our study with this movie. Very good movie!!
1186,5119367,3,The disc is defective three fourths to the movie.  I love the story of Joseph except for the defective segments.
1187,5119367,5,"A well done ""Joseph"". Great acting and production values. I recommend it whole heartedly. I always loved this bible story and this was well done."
1188,5119367,5,This one was really interesting!  Loved it completely.  Acting was exceptional.  It flowed so well.  I liked the temple of it.  Everything fell into place.  No fillers to eat up time.  This Movie is a Winner!
1189,5119367,5,This is one of the best if not the best interpretation of the story of Joseph I have seen.  It follows the Bible exactly with little differentiation from the story.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.
1190,5119367,5,"The service was fast and it was what I ordered. I said what I had to say why in the world do I need to waste your time and mine?
Your request for more words is BAD"
1191,5119367,5,"Love the story of Joseph!  Excellent example of a Christian, strong in faith, choosing to do right in every situation!  Forgiveness of the wrong doing by the brothers tugs at the heart strings!"
1192,5119367,5,"I absolutely love learning the Bible and what God has done, is doing and will do in my life.  Movies like this one help me understand the different books of the Bible and when I read each book in the Old Testament or the New Testament and see the movies that pertain to those books, I have a clearer understanding of what I am reading.  I am very careful to buy the movies that give the true meaning of what the Bible says and not some superficial storyline that goes is not accurate with the Bible.  This movie is great and a must have if you enjoy biblical movies, true to the Bible."
1193,5119367,4,"Very well done.  Overall it's faithful to the Book of Genesis, which it portrays.  Only in a few details it contradicts Genesis, such as:  When Joseph first appears before Pharaoh, the book of Genesis says that he ""shaved,"" implying that he had had a beard before this.  The movie, however, has him clean-shaven throughout.  A serious flaw is that the movie has Joseph's brothers threaten to attack him with spears just before he reveals his identity to them.  Also, Joseph's servant cuts the brothers' grain sacks open, spilling the grain on the ground.  Rather, Genesis leads me to believe that he simply opened the sacks and looked inside.  Also, Genesis says that the brothers took chariots laden with provisions to tell Jacob of Joseph's position in Egypt.  The movie has them walking all the way, with no chariots.

The scene where Potiphar's wife tries to seduce Joseph is a little to racy.  He's clearly naked in a bath, and she touches him.  This could have been done better.

In spite of these and certain other flaws, I give the movie four stars, since it's well done and inspirational."
1194,5119367,5,It came exactly when promised. It is my favorite movie about the Bible. It is very accurate. I recommend it to all I know who are interested in Bible stories.
1195,5119367,5,This was by far a phenomenal version of Joseph! I pay attention to various details as it pertains to reading any bible different from the KJV and or watching movies depicting stories from the bible and this was a great version
1196,5119367,5,"No matter how many times I watch it, it is still very moving. Excellent acting, excellent adherence to the true story, and something I will soon not forget and enjoy watching again. I bought several copies to give as gifts."
1197,5119367,5,I loved this movie and had seen it many times years ago and had to have the dvd. The glorious depiction of Joseph and his devout faith and obedience in God despite his tumultuous family life and the false accusation that led to his imprisonment. We have been studying Joseph in our Sunday school class and the movie in addition to the Bible readings just brought it to life. Beautifully done.....I can watch it over and over and over again....
1198,5119367,5,"This is a great movie if you want to understand the story of Joseph (son of Jacob) in the Bible.
Ben Kingsley in the movie is just an added bonus..... :)"
1199,5119367,5,"I cannot help but notice that ALL of those who serve God have to suffer for him. Though the churches today teach you don't have to suffer, the Bible says different. I wish I were as strong as Joseph. He sure isn't a ""why me"" type."
1200,5119367,5,"Probably the most accurate account of the life of Joseph out there along with excellent acting.  The humility of Joseph is portrayed so well and it does not stray from the true account of Joseph's life at all.  The movie spans many years even including the incident about Dinah, Leah's daughter.  Excellent, excellent movie.  I can't imagine anyone not liking this.  *****THIS IS NOTHING LIKE  PAUL, THE APOSTLE--(I believe also put out as part of the bible collection)*** which I literally threw out in the trash!  I hope this helps you."
1201,5119367,5,"This item goes with the rest of my bible collection. It is a must have and it is close to the bible, and again you do have Hollywood theatrics"
1202,5119367,5,This is a movie that was made close to the King James Version of the Bible.  It is a good movie
1203,5119367,5,"This is one of my favorite movies from my absolute most favorite bible stories.
I watch it 3-4 times a year."
1204,5119367,4,I enjoyed this much better than the movies Abraham or Jacob - this was pretty accurate although still some unnecessary additions but totally enjoyable as Joseph pictures Christ in over 60 references!!
1205,5119367,5,Movie is one of my very favorites.  I have bought it several times as either it keeps getting stolen or I just forget to pack it up and bring it home.  Characters and storyline are both well done.
1206,5119367,5,"Every time I watch this program, I learn something new. It does not get old. I smile when I watch the bad, but very human behavior of his brothers. To think that they became leaders of the tribes of Israel!

Excellent movie. Of course, Ben Kingsley is fabulous."
1207,5119367,5,"You will enjoy the story of Joseph , it's very entertaining , it will keep you watching, what's going to happen to Joseph next . The good think about the story of Joseph is where he ends up at the end . Good story excellent film."
1208,5119367,5,"I'm always on the look out for quality films but especially for the holidays. I had seen this movie many years ago on television. I believe they made it into a mini series. The acting was wonderful. The story line uplifting. Great example of faith, hard work and being true to your beliefs no matter the circumstances and hardships."
1209,5119367,5,"In my humble opinion, this is one of the most well acted BIBLE stories and clearly tells the story of Joseph. Give ideas of how he might have felt and how he overcame throughout his life. Well worth buying to add to you video collection."
1210,5119367,5,"i am a big fan of this item was so glad to get it, and it was everything i hoped it would be"
1211,5119367,5,"Love this dvd brings tears to my wife,G-DS faithfulness is amazing HIS promises always on time you will love this"
1212,5119367,5,"this was a Christmas present for my father and we both watch and enjoyed it. although 3 hours long, and the producer and director took some creative license  to keep the story going it mostly was in keeping with the bible. I gave it 5 stars cos I thoroughly enjoyed it."
1213,5119367,5,"This is my go to movie for when I need to be humble. This telling of Joseph is very, very close to the Bible, and that is what I was looking for. Sometimes when you purchase this movies it is strictly Hollywood version. This time they got it right."
1214,5119367,5,"All time favorite movie!!!! Based on the Biblical account of Joseph & how his brothers sold him into slavery and how God turned the situation all around!!  Excellent movie.  If you've never read the story or saw the movie - this is a must.  Its' stellar performances by the actors makes it even more enjoyable.  One word of caution, the scene where Potifar's wife tries to seduce Joseph while bathing is extremely steamy & sexual. That's unfortunate because other than that scene and one other scene that's sexual in nature, this would have been an excellent movie to watch with a church group.  But in my opinion, it's too steamy for mixed company and/or church viewing.  Other than that, it's an A+++++ movie!!!  The ending will bring you to tears!"
1215,5119367,5,"As a Born Again Christian <3 ALL BY FATHER GODS GRACE <3 I Love this version Of Joseph. Very Accurate <3 I 'WAS"" An Alcoholic <3 PRAISE THE LORD <3 Started to drink at 8 years old. I ""WAS"" An alcoholic that Did keep all in Control Until I was 47.

1216,5119367,5,I used to watch this all the time on TBN and I just had to have it in my collection.  Great story.  Really shows you the heart Joseph has.
1217,5119367,5,"Acting was very good, the story line was well done and included all the important parts of the tale  without adding too much conjecture in."
1218,5119367,5,"I love the story of Joseph, it reminds me of my life. I was betrayed and mistreated by all of my family members because they don't like me for different reasons. Joseph remains honest and faithful to Potifer. He was in prison for a false accusation Potifers wife made about him..(Just how I felt imprisoned by the people around me)In the end of all the opression people up in his face with false accusations the Pharaoh gives him authority over his Kingdom because god given him the gift to interpret dreams. Joseph also made a comment in the movie that made me laugh. Clothes are meaningless~ Im still a slave."
1219,5119367,5,"Very well done.  Great acting for most of it.  towards the end the main character loses me a little bit, but for the most part I like it a lot."
1220,5119367,4,"Though it's been a while, I recall this as being a rather excellent film.  Peter Chattaway tells us that ""disparate elements are woven into Joseph's story without sacrificing the film's dramatic unity; the result is unexpectedly coherent, even poignant....[It]is about as rich a three-hour epic as one could want from television: complex, challenging and convincing, it has enough emotional power to draw you into its world and enough realism to make you want to stay there (Review: The Bible Collection, Patheos(dot)com, 1996)"
1221,5119367,5,This is an excellent movie which I have used in Sunday School.  The youth were able to envision the Bible's narrative in Genesis much more clearly because of the fine acting and appreciative telling of the Joseph story.
1222,5119367,5,"I love the story of Joseph and his brothers.  As the world might say, a tale of Joseph,  Nothing in the Bible is a tale or fabricated as the world might say.  Love the actor also love Ben Kingsley."
1223,5119367,5,"Great Bible movie, I personally believe after watching quite a few Bible movies like Abraham, David, Samson and Delilah, Jeremiah, the Ten Commandments, and Solomon, that this is the most accurate live-action Bible created. I watched this when I was 5 and I still watch it 15 years later. There is a bit of violence, by that's just how the story is. This isn't bloody, and the Joseph-Potiphar's Wife scenes aren't for kids, but besides that, this is great."
1224,5119367,5,"Joseph clearly tells how God can use anyone.  Despite his background of brothers who hated him and sold him into slavery, he held on through prison years in Egypt and became the second highest, most powerful leader in Egypt.  When his brothers finally came to the realization that this leader under Pharoah was indeed their very own brother, it was then that Joseph forgave them for what transpired in his youth.  It's a lesson we can all take to heart."
1225,5119367,5,I have watched this film over and over loaned to all of my friends we all give it a 5 star. This movie is so well done if you like Biblical movies you must see this one.
1226,5119367,5,"Excellent Choice - A good story line and well communicated. Its a simple, but inspiring interpretation. Recommeded to watch and share"
1227,5119367,5,this movie brought tears of jOY AND HAPPINESS to my eyes I can watch this movie over and over awesome movies
1228,5119367,5,I used this to help teach a third and fourth grade Bible class.  Very interesting and  help keep their attention.
1229,5119367,5,"This movie is a hidden gem- part of the TNT movies ""The Bible Collection.""  Ben Kingsley, Paul Mercurio and Lelsey Ann Warren star in this account of the story of Joseph, a young Hebrew man who is sold into slavery by his jealous brothers and ends up in Egypt. Due to his faith, hard work and God-given talent for interpreting dreams, he goes from being a slave to the second in command of Egypt. His brothers eventually come to Egypt when a great famine hits and they initially don't recognize him; their reunion scenes are pretty moving in this account. While there is some minor artistic license taken, this movie is very accurate to the actual Biblical account of the story in Genesis 37-45.  Even if one has no Biblical or religious knowledge or leanings, it is a very entertaining story by itself and worth watching! Very good price on Amazon, too!"
1230,5119367,5,"An excellent movie.  One that I highly recommend for anyone looking at biblical history, or just a very fine story."
1231,5119367,5,This was a great DVD. It tells the story of Joseph and his family. Good for the whole family and great for reinforcing your knowledge of the Bible.
1232,5119367,5,Great movie. Excellent acting and definitely not boring. Thank God like most Bible based movies these days this movie is exceeding with talent
1233,5119367,5,"This is the best version of Joseph out there.  Very well written, produced, and directed.  They did a great job of filling in the gaps in the story line and making it a powerful tale of forgiveness and deliverance."
1234,5119367,5,"joseph is one of my favorite movies. I can watch it over and over and
not get tired of watching it."
1235,5119367,5,I saw this movie many years ago on T.V. and have been searching for it ever since.  I am so glad I found it.  I want all of my family members to see it.  Follows the Bible closely and the acting is great.
1236,5119367,5,A+ now I have on dvd we love it!  this is a family favorite and we had on an old VHS but now on dvd
1237,5119367,5,I showed this movie at a Bible study after we had read the story of Joseph in Genesis and man did it bring a whole new perspective and depth to the Bible study. People were inspired.  At times they wanted to cry. It definitely touched them. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone that wants to experience the Joseph story in a whole new and powerful way.
1238,5119367,5,The actors and actresses in this film are wonderful at their portrayal of the biblical characters involved in Joseph's life.  A definite most have.
1239,5119367,4,A believable re-telling of the story while respecting it. Exceptional performances by stellar cast. And all of it at a great price!
1240,5119367,5,I knew this particular movie would be great. Iv'e seen it when it came out. This movie came out in 1995. A modern classic.
1241,5119367,5,to see how they take a name from bible (JOSEPH)  and turn it in to a dvd movie to show how it was in the bible days
1242,5119367,5,I thought both actors did a beautiful job of acting out the roles and it was so closey written according to the account in the bible.  I love it.
1243,5119367,5,"One of the best-done Bible movies ever, if not the very best.  I'm a pastor.  Great acting; great story telling.  Pretty good regarding Biblical faithfulness.  The theology in this has nothing objectionable, and I'm a stickler on getting theology right, since that's my job.  Even the extra-Biblical stuff that's in the movie is not Biblically-off.  Great theological themes pervade the movie.  Like someone else said, I could've done without the bath scene.  There's no nudity in it, and something like this might have happened, sure; but it makes me unable to hand the DVD over to my younger daughters.  I always have to watch this with them and flip by that scene when it comes up.  Don't let that deter you from buying this, though.  This is in the series done by Ted Turner.  I wish Christians, in making Biblical movies, would be as theologically and Biblically accurate and excellent as this film.  Bravo!  I love this movie."
1244,5119367,5,"I thought the movie was sufficiently close to the Bible story. The sets were often lacking, but I enjoyed the movie anyway. I had a copy that I bought with the Bible Collection 7 or 8 years ago that I loaned out and never got back. I was happy to get this at around $7.
I recommend the Bible Collection highly."
1245,5119367,5,Its so hard to find movies that the whole family can watch. This movie projects positive values with an engaging story. The acting was very believeable and top notch.
1246,5119367,5,This was the most realistic and believable presentation of this beloved story that I've ever seen. Absolutely wonderful and I can't recommend it highly enough!
1247,5119367,5,"The best movie ever seen and own. Its actually my favorite movie of all time. its worth to have, its so accurate from the bible. very inspiring and educational. Buy It"
1248,5119367,5,"I have watched this version of ""Joseph"" numerous times also on TV and am once again glad to add this one to my collection of Bible DVD's. It's entertainment but for me it's much than that I'm able to receive a better understanding of my Bible it's like a learning process to test me on my Bible knowledge and see how well I know the scriptures, for instance when I'm able to pick something out of the movie that may not be quite true to scripture I go check my Bible and I'm able to learn my scriptures better and my Bible. I believe by watching the DVD over and over and even having different versions you absorb more into your memory and it can be your own individual Bible study. I was really amazed and excited when I saw that you offered many of these DVD's of (The Bible Collection) which are some of my favorites. Hoping to collect them all and other versions plus other Christian DVD's to learn from them for a better understanding of God's true Word."
1249,5119367,5,This is a fantastic movie or the retelling of the Story of Joseph.  The scenery in the movie is fantastic too.  The actors are great in each of their roles.  I'm glad I ordered this movie.  Saw it many years ago.
1250,5119367,5,"I have watched this movie several times.  I really enjoy it.  It is an accurate account from the Bible.
  Thanks candpfoote"
1251,5119367,5,"This is an astonishing movie. Faith in GOD which is something people have lost.
Why Because the movie can move the soul of a Believer.
Recommend anyone that has lost trust in GOD"
1252,5119367,5,This movie captured my heart the first time  that I saw it several years ago. It doesn't stray from the way the bible presents it.
1253,5119367,5,"As with Abraham, starring Richard Harris, I saw this on TV and was  very impressed with how it followed the Bible and the customs of the time. I would feel ""safe' about  doing a Sunday school study showing either one of them. Both movies were correct as to costuming and locations. Again than you for offering these movies, and also to the film makers for these quality films."
1254,5119367,5,I have periodically viewed this film ever since it first was aired.  Got the DVD to have a more permanent copy. Always will love it !!!
1255,5119367,5,Just what I ordered. No surprises. I am a pastor and we just  finished studying the book of Genesis and w finished that book by watching this movie.
1256,5119367,4,Love this movie! It came later than it said it would but worth the wait. Would recommend it to anyone.
1257,5119367,5,"This is my favorite movie of all times. It is so realistic that I cry every time I watch. The characters are extremely good in their acting, and I especially enjoyed the Joseph character, Paul Mercurio. I would definatly  recommend this movie!!"
1258,5119367,5,"Joseph as a faithful servant of God, in spite of circumstances reasonates throughout this move. Great acting, good portrayal of the time period

I originally had the film on VHS and shared it with friends. In fact, one of them still has the VHS version. So, I purchased two copies of the video -- one for me and one for my son.

Definitely a required stable in your video library."
1259,5119367,5,"So when I misplaced the videos, they were a gift I looked for them everywhere.  I gave up and forgot about this movie for the longest and then I found on Amazon I was so excited.  On VHS it was two tapes because its over 3 hours long but now I only have to worry about one single DVD."
1260,5119367,4,"I liked this movie, except one scene where Potipher's wife is seducing Joseph, and he has a hard time resisting at first, whereas, Biblically, I think he was stronger than that.  I REALLY like the actor playing Potipher.  Because of the scene mentioned, I am hesitant to allow my younger children to view it. But, other than that, it was done excellently."
1261,5119367,5,"As most movies, this story takes a little liberty with Bible history; the way the story is laid out, it brings reality to the likely interaction between Joseph, his family and those he met in Egypt.  A warning to parents - the DVD has scenes you may not have seen in the tv version (a couple of them gratuitous-a scene showing nudity in the pool of his wife and children and the hanging of the baker); the scene with Joseph and Potiphar's wife does a great job of showing just how difficult it must have been for Joseph to stand firm in his principles (would be a little mature for young audiences)."
1262,5119367,1,"Bought this from dvdbargainbuy and the audio is the worst I've ever heard from any DVD.  This is an older DVD - 1995 - so there is a chance that you might not be getting a real copy.  (We rented this years ago and the rental was fine, so we know it isn't part of the movie)"
1263,5119367,5,I bought this for my grandmother for  a birthday gift. She loves this movie and is very happy to own it.
1264,5119367,5,Paul Mercurio is absolutely great in this movie!  Really well made and it puts words into action and make the Bible come to life.
1265,5119367,5,"gave it as a gift to my sister she love it.  a good telling of the life of Joseph, son of jacob."
1266,5119367,5,I used this movie in my prison ministry bible study. It was very well done and followed the bible very closely. Joseph as revealed in the book of Genesis of the scripture is a type of Jesus and the movie brought this out which shows an obvious insight and knowledge do God's word. I would highly recommend this DVD for all family viewing.
1267,5119367,5,"I loved the movie.  It was exactly what I had hoped for.  I had been wanting DVD that would bring the words of the Bible to life, like the Ten Commandments.  It was great.  Loved the movie."
1268,5119367,5,"This tape is a ""must see"" whether it is Christmas or Easter, or any time throughout the year.  The quality of the tape was perfect and was a great buy."
1269,5119367,5,"I had these three DVD, this one Joseph and David and Abraham for a long time. I believe it was in the late 1990,s and I got them on VHS and then I donated them to a nursing home because I knew they would really enjoy them. And then I  brought them on DVD. So I have enjoyed this movies for a long time. I also got Abraham on VHS and I gave it away and brought it on DVD. All were excellent."
1270,5119367,5,I Love Sir Ben Kingsley in this role! It follows the Biblical account well. The BEST Joseph I have ever seen!
1271,5119367,5,"Since the story of Joseph is one of my favorite mentioned in the bible, this version hit the spot.  I feel the actors/actresses did a good job in this movie."
1272,5119367,5,"i have been collecting biblicle movies Moses,Ben hur, for the Sunday school class,these movies make even the stubborn teen put down his phone and pay attenion.  you here that Hollywood!!! no more cops and robber movies!!!!!!!!! make great movies again."
1273,5119367,5,Always a favorite story from the scriptures brought to life in this excellent film adaptation. Lots of messages and lessons.
1274,5119367,5,"Good Good movie,  at least to me.  I have given several coppies away in hopes of people gathering the lessons offered within the biblical story line.  but even without that, it's a good movie.  Blessed be the Lord our God, the God of Abraham, Isac and Jacob.  and blessed be HIs only begotten son, our Lord Jesus Christ."
1275,5119367,5,I really enjoyed this movie.  I thought the relationship between Potifer and his wife and his wife and Joseph really striking.  Several things that I had not thought of before.  Such as: why didn't Potifer have Joseph killed when his wife accused him of rape? and How did his brothers react to him after he became Pharaoh's advisor.
1276,5119367,5,"I am an avid Bible reader and even though there was a bit of Hollywood in it, the overall theme and content was very close to the written word.  Thumbs up for it."
1277,5119367,5,Really entertaining.  It keeps you drawn into one of the greatest stories of the bible and does  a good job of following the story as told in scripture.
1278,5119367,5,My small group bible class was able to follow the bible with this movie. It was very informative and the sound track was great.
1279,5119367,5,"This movie is very inspirational to me, it helped me through my trails and tribulations during the time I needed it most, this movie relates to me."
1280,5119367,5,One of the greatest movies ever made; and is the favorite of my 6 year old grandson.  It is worth watching in every possible way.
1281,5119367,5,This portrayal of Joseph's story is very good.  It is biblically pretty accurate and features good performances by the actors.  I recommend it to individual and family audiences!  It's one of the great stories of the Bible.
1282,5119367,5,"really great acting in this DVD. Ben Kingsley is one of the best. For those  of you who know the story, it is worth a look at thos version on DVD."
1283,5119367,3,"If it weren't for the seduction scene with Potiphar's wife, this movie would have been excellent.  That scene was so sensual that it was borderline ""R"" rated in our book.  I almost shut it off at that scene.  Before the actual Biblical account of Jospeh running off, leaving his garment behind him, there is a scene in which Potiphar's wife joins him in a bathing room and (while he is in a pool) clearly and very erotically reaches her hands under the water and strokes his private parts.  He doesn't flee that time!  This scene ruined the movie for us, and though we've enjoyed other movies from this series, we couldn't keep this movie because of that one scene.  Too bad!"
1284,5119367,5,"This is the best movie of all time. I have probably watched it 20+ times! The acting is superb and the story is pretty close to the Bible story of Joseph. There are some fillers added but, if there weren't, the movie would be too short. It's beautiful and will keep your attention from beginning to end. Parents please be aware that, even though this is a family story, there are a couple of surprisingly sensual scenes where Potaphar's wife is seducing (molesting, really) Joseph. These scenes may not be appropriate for children. When the scene comes up where Joseph is bathing, you may want to send the kids to the kitchen to grab the popcorn!"
1285,5119367,5,"This is a brilliant epic movie, a tour de force, the best Biblical movie I have seen with the exception of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Night-with-the-King/dp/B000JJSJO6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Night with the King</a>&nbsp;Starring Paul Mercurio in the title role, he gives an intelligent and passionate performance of a man who was prepared to die, to keep to the word of his G-D.
Ben Kingsley is his usual magnificent self in his role of Potiphar which he plays with panache. Warren Clark played a sterling role as Potiphar's thuggish overseer Domo Ednan, later to be Joseph's aid de camp. A deliciously evil Potiphar's Wife is captured in brilliant detail by Lesley Ann Warren and the actors playing the ten brothers also acquit themselves well staying true to the form of Israelite tribesman

The movie begins with the purchase of Joseph by Potiphar, and his rise from that of a lowly slave to Potiphar's major domo where he captures the attention of Potiphar's evil wife, when he resists her attention and she accuses him of assaulting her, Potiphar soon knows he is innocent, and he embarks on the telling of his story of his boyhood, including the narrative of the rape of his half-sister  Dinah (played with shyness and prettiness by Mexican actress Paloma Baeza), and the destruction of the Canaanite town of Schechem  in revenge by her brothers Simeon (Vincenzo Nicoli) and Levi (Colin Bruce) Then we move to the central story whose tale baring and father's favour lead to his brother's brutal attack of him, where he is thrown into a pit and sold to Ishmaelite traders.

His rise in prison, his interpretation of the dreams of Pharaoh (Stefano Dionisi) at the same time as we are taken back to Canaan and see the story of Tamar( a pert and beautiful Kelly Miller ) and Judah (Michael Attwell). The final sequence where Joseph's brothers go down to Egypt until the moving scene where he reveals himself to his brothers is the finest.
The sex scenes are tasteful and not at all gratuitous in any way , and yes this is an adult movie, but they simply cover what is told in the Bible without going further and it is extremely narrow minded to find them offensive"
1286,5119367,5,"FAST, FRIENDLY AND GREAT SERVICE! I RECEIVED MY MONEY'S WORTH AND NOTHING WAS BROKEN OR TORN. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS BUYER AND THEIR SERVICES!"
1287,5119367,5,The Joseph DVD arrived in a reasonable amount of time and was exactly as I had pictured it from it's image and decscription on the web site.
1288,5119367,5,"This is the closest to the Bible.  I've seen it on TV and really enjoyed it.  I am trying to collect several of the best, and this is one."
1289,5119367,5,"I recommend this movie, Joseph. It is a great reprentation of  of a truly kind, just, and merciful God and the people He loves. We all need positive and true to life movies that are not only good for the heart, but for the soul."
1290,5119367,5,"Ah, my favorite Bible story. After watching this and seeing how well produced it was, I can only say that I watch it ast lease twice a month."
1291,5119367,5,This movie is very thoughtful and insightful in the portrayal of Joseph of Egypt. I would highly recommend this movie to all.
1292,5119367,5,"I have used this movie several times (VCR version) in prison ministry.  The women respond well to the visuals of the Biblical story of Joseph.  I do warn them & you that certain liberties have been taken in the movie.  I object to the portrayal of Potiphar's wife with Joseph.  If you plan to use this with children, teens, or those unfamiliar with the Biblical record, you should preview and provide advance instruction.  Also the encounter between Tamar & Judah needs Biblical background.  However, I do recommend the video."
1293,5119367,5,"A movie never presents a story exactly as you envisioned it, but nevertheless, every movie version you see gives you new insights into the story.  This is a very Biblically accurate version of the Joseph story, not changing the Biblical story but rather developing it.  (For example, in this version, Potiphar believes Joseph is innocent of immorality with his wife, and Joseph tells him about his past as a flashback, not found in the Bible.)  The massacre at Shechem in Genesis 34 is included and shows what rotten people some of Joseph's brothers were.  The actors for the brothers do very well demonstrating individuality but also a group mentality, and they show powerful character change by the end.  It's interesting that the movie shows the brothers have really changed just by showing their eager attitude in blessing the name of God with their father Jacob (""Blessed be His name"")!  The actor for Jacob does very well, too.  (The actor for Joseph is fine, too, but the character couldn't have too much personality, because every viewer has a preconceived expectation of what he should be like.)  The movie introduced me to an interesting idea, which is that Jacob may have been involved in preserving genealogies and stories from Abraham.  The Book of Genesis does have a much more continuous account of Jacob's life, whereas stories of Abraham's life are like disconnected snapshots.  So what I got most out of this movie was the interesting idea that the Book of Genesis was recorded before Moses' time."
1294,5119367,5,The DVD came in a timely fashion and was excellent.  As a matter of fact I am still watching this from time to time. This movie is still in excellent condition. I will be using this seller many days to come. Thank you so very much.
1295,5119367,5,Awesome movie and great story.  Highly recommend this movie and follows closely to biblical accounts.  The message is strong about forgiveness and faithfulness.
1296,5119367,5,"How wonderful that a story about precognitive dreams has become such a famous and beautiful story.  We are all wise to pay attention to our dreams, but not all of us have a talented and high-minded interpreter like Joseph.  Even Freud in ""The Interpretation of Dreams"" admits that precognitive dreams are not unusual."
1297,5119367,5,I started watching this movie on TV with my grandson and we did not get to see the last part.  I knew it was an older movie and knew my best chances of finding it would be on Amazon.com.  I was not disappointed!  There it was and I ordered it that night!  The movie came in the mail within the next week and we sat down and watched it right away.  An excellent movie that we will watch again and again.
1298,5119367,5,This is a wonderful story of the beginning rise of the nation of Israel.  I would almost rate this movie as good as the Ten Commandments.  I found myself in tears at the end of this movie so new watchers beware!
1299,5119367,5,"This movie is extremely well made. It is so touching when Joseph's brothers throw him into a pit. His crying and pleading with them to be merciful is so moving as is the part when Joseph finally meets his brothers again and tells them who he really is.
Exceptionally well made, I recommend this movie as high as possible.  A true hero in a world of doubt and sorrows it helps to know that human issues of understanding, forgiveness and love are always with us and always have been."
1300,5119367,5,One of the better bible stories out there.
1301,5119367,1,"The acting was good, the story was correct, but naked backsides was not necessary.  Also the Potiphers wife did not need to be so very seductive of a naked Joseph. Not a Christian movie.  I felt that even though it was probably portrayed truthfully, Christans do not need to see so explicit a scene.  This should be rated PG 13 at least."
1302,5119367,5,This video was wonderful.  It was a very touching movie and kept within the story written in the Bible.  I watched it several times and shared with a friend.
1303,5119367,5,"This DVD is excellent.  I saw it a few times on TCT and enjoyed it very much.  Realizing I could have my own copy was great news.  It offers hope for those going through unjust persecution.  It helps my faith to realize God will never abandon us, no matter what!  God can make good even out of evil intentions.  Recommended for family viewing."
1304,5119367,5,"that movie is amazing, i watch all the time. many of my co-workers have ordered this movie. You will love it, having faith in our Lord moves many mountains.
May God Bless you all!"
1305,5119367,5,This film was expertly directed and brought out many good points of the history of Joseph. I would highly recommend this disk to anyone.
1306,5119367,5,Very good movie.  Another great Bible character truly comes to life and is a good message for the family.
1307,5119367,5,My son has been collecting the different books of the bible for a while now.  He is so excited that I am able to order these from Amazon.  He has a few more DVD'S that we need to order to complete his collection.  I'm am very pleased with the DVD and quick shipment.
1308,5119367,5,"The movie Joseph from The Bible Collection is an extremely worthwhile movie to watch. As a Bible-believing Christian and follower of Christ, the main criteria for me is always the question--Is it true to the biblical text? This movie, combined with the King James language is extremely close to the biblical text and I can almost follow along in scripture with many scenes. It is very enjoyable and portrays the biblical account in a fresh, relevant way.

I highly recommend Joseph to any family and encourage any parent to watch it with their children, teenagers and even young adults that may be out of the home and on their own. Recently, I watched David from this Collection with my 23-year-old son when he came to visit and am awaiting his return to watch Joseph.

The movie is poignant and lively as it retells the story of the brothers' betrayl and sin against Joseph as they sell him into slavery. During these scenes, my heart was gripped, feeling many emotions as the story unfolded.

I believe this movie does an excellent job portraying the story of faith as Joseph rises to prominence within Pharoah's court, suffers in prison because of false accusations, and especially as he forgives his brothers. Joseph's revelation of his identity to his brothers and his reunion with his family is outstanding and emotionally moving.

The acting of Ben Kingsley as Pharoah and the rest of the cast is superb and it is best to watch it when you have 3 hours to set aside or take an intermission in the middle of it. This movie will enhance your biblical knowledge of Joseph while adding a visual dimension to your Bible knowledge.

The movie also provides a wonderful introduction with moral lessons to any child, teenager or young adult. Another movie that I highly recommended from The Bible Collection is David starring Nathaniel Parker and Leonard Nimoy. It is one of my favorites and like Joseph, is very close to the original King James text. Thanks for listening."
1309,5119367,5,"I found this depiction of Joseph's plight to more accurate than most efforts I have seen. It was full of adventure; ups and down, yet a reflection of unwavering faith. I find myself learning more and more each time I watch this movie; and I have watched it a bunch of times. Great message in a great movie."
1310,5119367,4,"I had originally bought the VHS version of the movie and I was delighted that I found it on DVD. There was a scene in the movie that was edited somewhat on the VHS version. That scene I wasn't happy with, and it detracted away from the wholesomeness of the movie, but overall I think it is a good movie and it depicts the biblical account of Joseph's life. It is a good movie, and worth buying and watching. Not likely to allow younger children under 10 to see it though (with out editing that graphic scene)."
1311,5119367,4,"This telling of the story of Joseph in the TNT Bible Collection is very good.  Although certain liberties were taken with the account as fleshed out in the Bible, these did not impact the overall telling of the story in keeping with what the Bible reveals.  The use of Joseph telling of his early history with his brothers and how he came to be a slave in Egypt was done as a flashback, which actually enhanced the dramatic telling of the story.  Very nicely done and mostly true to the Bible account."
1312,5119367,5,One terrific movie.  I had it years ago in a VHS and saw it multiple times to the point that the VHS was damaged.  Me and my son just love this movie.  Now I have it in DVD.
1313,5119367,1,"Utterly grievous... My wife and I didn't make it past the stomach sickening, unbiblical, immoral scene where she's grabbing Joseph's jewels in the bath. We were both very disturbed. I thought I was watching a family film, not a porno-promo. Twenty minutes later and I still feel sickened. Judging by the reviews I read by others, the film continues to inaccurately portray many other critically important facts about the life of Joseph. It's not worth watching the truth of God's Holy Word twisted and profaned for the sake of enjoying ourselves with unholy entertainment. Please do not grieve the Holy Spirit by subjecting yourself to this.

""Your eye is a lamp that provides light for your body. When your eye is good, your whole body is filled with light. But when your eye is bad, your whole body is filled with darkness. And if the light you think you have is actually darkness, how deep that darkness is!"" - Jesus (Matthew 6:22, 23)

""... the light you think you have..."" Selah."
1314,5119367,5,"This is one of the very best renditions of the story of Joseph. This is a high quality ""Hollywood"" production. Big names, big set. The thing that impressed me the most about this movie (as well as it's companions, Abraham, and Jacob) was the accuracy. You can almost turn page by page through your Bible and follow along. Highly recommended."
1315,5119367,2,"This film is, without a doubt, a Christian perspective on the Joseph story. Or as one of your reviewers commented, there are messianic threads cleverly interwoven throughout. For example, nowhere in the old testament does Jacob EVER say that he gives his inheritance to Joseph. This is an obvious suggestion that Jesus, descended from the tribe of Joseph (and whose nominal ""father"" is Joseph)is to inherit Gods blessings, with Christians inheriting the covenant of the Israelites. And the scene of Joseph imprisoned in the Pharaoh's prison saying to God ""why have you forsaken me"" is NOWHERE mentioned in the old testament; it is strictly put in to provide a Christian slant. Toward the end of the movie, when Joseph goes to see his father, there is a scene in which a large number of crosses appear (briefly). And incidentally, when Joseph and his father meet, the former is shown bowing down to the latter. However, as is clearly stated in the old testament, when Joseph has his dream in which the sun, moon and the stars bow before him, for this dream to be fulfilled (as are all the others in the Joseph story), Jacob (the sun) must bow down to Joseph, not the reverse. I don't have a problem with Christian Messianic films, and I in fact saw this on the Trinity Broadcasting Network, but before everyone falls all over themselves saying what a saintly film this is, please, recognise that it has been made with a specific point of view in mind, namely Christianity, and that there are other perspectives on the Joseph story that are quite different.  I think that some honesty on this subject would raise this film above the level of Christian propaganda."
1316,5119367,5,"There are no words accurate enough to praise this enthralling television miniseries.  ""Joseph"" is one of the most fascinating of biblical accounts, and I will not rehash the plot since it is done superbly by other reviewers here.  I will simply say that this timeless true account of a faithful and courageous young man is a wonderful tool to use with teenagers.  Satan has planted so much filth in the movie industry, and I praise God that there are filmmakers who still desire to present the truth.  ""Joseph"" presents a magnificent story of forgiveness and integrity that all teenagers can learn from.

This miniseries is one of the best biblical retellings in film fashion I've ever come across.  The story grabs you from the very beginning and is never dull.  Paul Mercurio is excellent in his portrayal of Joseph, presenting a teenager and young man with exceptional character.  Mercurio brings a vulnerability to this man that endeared him to me at once.  The scene where he cries for mercy after his brothers' betrayal moved me to tears.  Joseph struggles with temptations and is flawed like us all.  Ben Kingsley is excellent as Potipher, portraying a man of integrity and care.  The actors portraying Joseph's brothers are equally excellent.

Several reviewers have complained about the scene with Joseph and Potipher's wife, a femme fatale portrayed with unabashed glee by Leslie Ann Warren.  This scene is sexually charged, but I believe it is accurate with Scripture.  The Bible doesn't sugarcoat things, nor should we think the Bible hereos were not susceptible to temptation.  Although God never reveals if Potipher's wife was a temptation to Joseph, I logically don't see how she could not have ben.  He was, after all, seventeen when the attempted seduction took place.  Wouldn't any of us struggle in this area at this age? Besides, seeing Joseph struggle makes the viewer empathize with his predicament.  Anyway, I say this only to encourage you not to let this one scene put you off.  Please give this wonderful film a chance.  Happy viewing, and God bless you."
1317,5119367,5,Joseph is amazing story to read and watch.  A person with the lord's help goes through trail. goes from a lowely shepard boy to the second highest person in Egypt.
1318,5119367,5,"I really loved this movie ,it describes the biblical account pretty accurate. it starts w/ Joseph being sold to Egypt and backtracks after Joseph is accused from Potiphars wife, when Joseph defends himself in front of Potiphar through telling him his life story. I was clued to the screen the whole time. Also the actor for Joseph is very likable and also Jacob(Martin Landau) did a great performance."
1319,5119367,5,This is an incredible telling of the story of Joseph and the roller coaster ride on which he rode.  One of many Biblical Old Testament stories made by Turner Films and this is of very high quality.  Not the wooden-like acting which is not uncommon in Biblical story telling in some past films.  This is first-class and definitely worth 5 stars.
1320,5119367,2,"This film is closer to the Biblical text of this account, than any we've yet seen....it's very emotional and very encouraging as well.  Long film, but not too long!  The only real problem (meaning unacceptable) is the bath-tub scene with Joseph.  He's seen from waist up, in a pool relazing/bathing, and in comes his boss's wife who's been after him sexually.  Potiphar's wife seductively rubs up and down his chest, until (WITH MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS GOING ALONG WITH THE SEDUCTIVITY) she goes down into the water below his waist and connects with his genitals (yes, for real).  Both Joseph and her are shown to react to the moment ever so....""slightly"" and then she leaves him alone until the next time she confronts him.  We had this film for YEARS and thought how awesomely Biblical (compared to any other film) this movie was, but never noticed this part until this year.  Why?  because we had younger children at the time, and so the inferred sexual tension of her rubbing his shoulders over the bath-tub/pool was something we'd simply pass by w/ the fast-fwd button a mere several seconds.  We didn't do that this year, and WHOOOAH!!  We were SHOCKED at what transpired in those few moments.  They don't show below the water, but they PLAY UP the moment big time to let you know what is happening.  For this reason, i say DON'T BUY THE MOVIE unless you can edit it.  If i had this film on VCR, i'd simply tab the ""edit"" tab on the VCR tape and i'd record a whole minute or two over that one moment (which wouldn't hurt a 3-plus hour long film!).

It's truly a shame that the film makers snuck in a scene of this degree, they simply could have ended with the woman rubbing Joseph's shoulders in flirtation (showing her constant pursuit of him) and played up the moment that way, at that time.  However, they stuck a little leaven in to satisfy Hollywood and to ""leaven the whole loaf"" with making it clear that she was touching his genitals for a bit and he was helpless to deal with the tempation for a few moments.  This cheap move by the film makers reminds me of the ""Sampson"" film put out by the Bible Collection film makers....which is TOTALLY TRASHY...taking the sexuality way OVERBOARD for the Sampson screen (don't buy it! My family was apalled!).  Again, i say if you cannot edit the movie, DON'T BUY IT."
1321,5119367,5,i buy films mainly for my family memebers as gifts. this is a great depiction of this story from the bible. very well done for the period it was taken from.
1322,5119367,5,This movie kept as true to the actual bible as any movie I have ever seen. A good example of how God's miracles sometimes take a whole life time.
1323,5119367,5,This movie brought the Story of Joseph according to the Bible alive.  The bedrooom scene with Potiphar's wife could have been less graphic yet other than that the movie was enjoyable.
1324,5119367,5,"To say this movie is very good would not do it justice. Ignore the criticism of the, ""Bath scene."" Potipher's wife makes moves on Joseph- that's the way it was. The movie doesn't show nudity, but shows what an evil woman she was. Ben Kingsley, as always, was excellent in this movie. After the movie, you feel like you've had a feast!"
1325,5119367,5,"Joseph is an interesting and thought provoking movie.  I began watching it late one evening with the intent of recording it because it is a three hour movie.  I didn't think I could stay up long enough to see the entire movie.  It was so good, I couldn't turn it off!"
1326,5119367,5,"In my opinion this is one of the best movies ever. Good writting, acting, very good. Not perfect, but close. Probably no one could or will ever do better."
1327,5119367,5,Really good movie that's entertaining and comes with a good message. I think Hollywood followed the story pretty well of course they have to fill in some things for it to make sense. Definitely would recommend watching if you're in the mood for a biblical movie. Five star all the way!
1328,5119367,5,"Thank  you for delivering the exact item I ordered, in a Very Timely manner!"
1329,5119367,4,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie, espescially its ending. The casting was great (Okay fine, Josephs former master was a white woman, so what? She played her part well I thought). Sexually explicit scenes? Give me a break. There were no sexually explicit scenes. There was a scene of Joseph in the bath being tempted by Potiphar's wife. This is no different from a man/woman dealing with sexual thoughts/temptations daily, and that powerful scene would give any Christian in the spirit a visual illustration of the pressure Joseph felt. I especially liked his line when he said to her ""please, you push the limits of my body to more than it can bear."" The other added scenes did not take anything away from the movie, but gave it dimension. I will take 1 star away only because I do not think that scene where the brother slept with the ""prostitute"" who turned out to be his other brothers wife or whatever was necessary. Besides one or two minor things, overall I thought it was a great film, and the reunion at the end was well acted.

To the critics harping on sexually explicit, blah blah, gimme a break. There were no sexually explicit scenes in the film. Everything was very ""PG-13"" if not lower. If you call that sexually explicit then you should be censoring Songs of Solomon in the Bible which gives some steamy accounts from Solomon to his ""lover,"" or better yet, you should censor Jesus Christs crucifixion, which was very R-rated (being beaten, flogged, and nailed to a cross seems R-rated to me). Christianity focuses on the heart before appearances so lets all appreciate this great adaptation of Joseph's life. Great film!"
1330,5119367,5,"This movie was great.
Joseph's story is one of great humility and love for God.
The actor in this movie did an incredible job.
It's a long movie, worth every minute. You will cry!"
1331,5119367,5,"Great movie, very inspirational. Excellent cast and story. Wonderful story of abuse and ultimately forgiveness and redemption. Great move for all ages."
1332,5119367,5,"I'm very glad to have found this movie on dvd. I have seen it in stores; but it was more affordable through Amazon. I look forward to viewing the movie ""Joseph"" , perhaps with some friends, becauce I am currently studying the life of Joseph. I recommend the film to anyone who has yet to see it. Many thanks. SHAWN"
1333,5119367,5,"I love the story of Joseph.. it always inspires and humbles.. but I had never seen a movie that did it justice.. and even one that still left you (like the bible) asking questions or wondering.. (like.. what happened re Potiphar's wife after Joseph became the Governor of all Egypt.. and how did Joseph's brother's explain to Jacob that he wasn't dead after all but that they were lyings cowards who now had to come clean?) I loved that they included the story of how Tamar got pregnant by Joshua even if they misrepresented the tale of how the first 2 sons had died because of their wickedness before the Lord.
This movie is not perfect.. not totally accurate scripturally.. ie "" the rains never came but the Nile flooded"" when it only required the Nile to flood.. and the miniscule effort shown re the silos to hold 7 years grain etc etc.. but the story telling was marvellous and the starting from the middle of the tale to tell the story and adding the beginning as an insert.. all marvellous telling of an amazing tale.. the tale of the brothers, and the growth of Joseph and his relation to Jacob was excellent and well played. I have seen Martin Landau in many a movie or programme but he moves me to tears by his portrayal of Jacob and his love for Joseph. I love finding nitpicks in movies and this one has many too.. (ie the Tamar who receives the seal & staff is a different woman  than the beauty who plays her in most of the part) but overall it is an amazing truthful retelling of a biblical classic and if fairly accurate.. even the 'explicit' parts only show the realiry of the situation and any man can be moved to realise how easy it would have been to give in to temptation.. yet Joseph overcame.. Lesley Ann Warren was fabulous as the seductress looking amazing and then quickly becoming the horrid scorned woman.. tremendous.. Ben Kingsley as Potiphar opened my eyes to certain realities of scripture that I hadn't realised before.. and Paul Mercurio as Joseph with his real Joseph and emotive performance.. I found (and still find) the watching a wonderfully emotive and enlightening experience everytime I watch it.. and I watch it regularly.. it is the best of the bunch.. and a classic in it's own right. There are few movies I enjoy as much as this despite some of it's failings.. they did good in this one.. I would heartily recommend it."
1334,5119367,5,"E-X-C-E-L-L-E-N-T!!!!!  I love this movie.  The quality of the picture was great!  I recommend this movie highly. Everyone should own a copy.  Everytime I see it, it's like I'm seeing it for the first time.  It makes me cry every time.  Joseph is an ordinary man who loved God.  Joseph was loyal to God.  God rewarded Joseph for his faithfulness later on in his life.  We can all learn from this that if we are faithful to God, God will reward us as well.  Joseph learned that in forgiveness there is great joy and peace.  We can also learn this lesson from Joseph.  What I also learn from this story is that even when it looks like it's darkest in our lives, God can turn it around for our good if we only trust God and are faithful to Him.  This is a great character building movie.  It's a great family movie.  I just absolutely love it.  You will enjoy it too."
1335,5119367,5,"this movie is about the biblical joseph. it is a movie of sacrifice, courage ,serving , forgiveness,love and the strength of the Lord."
1336,5119367,5,"This movie is almost like the story of Joseph, thats written in the Bible. Joseph was a remarkable man! If only the leaders of the world today was like Joseph was, a wise man, who listened to God, and kept the Ten Commandments!

 Please read God's story of Joseph, thats in the book of Geneis, in the Holy Bible first, so that you can know Gods true account of Joseph firsthand! This is a awesome, and remarkable true story, of so long ago!

 My favorite part of the movie, is when Joseph meets the Pharoah of Egypt face to face! WOW! This movie was very well done, this movie is one of my favorite versions of Joseph! God blessed Joseph greatly, and had big plans for him all along, for living his life as a godly man! I loved the way Joseph, and his Egyption master(Ben Kingsley), became friends, and earned each others trust and respect, eventhough Joseph was still a slave.

 It always amazed me, how Joseph was able to forgive his brothers, especially after what they did to him! Joseph was a very wise, and brillant man! I highly recommend this movie, it is based on a very true, and awesome story, thats in the HOLY BIBLE! This movie is very good, and I loved it very much! You will end up watching it more than once!"
1337,5119367,5,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good, the costumes inhanced the film, and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
1338,5119367,5,This is an excellent portrayal of the Joseph's story.  Joseph has been a powerful inspiration for Bible Wealth Transfer.
1339,5119367,1,"The film is probably historically accurate, for the most part, except in some very key points.  I have not done extensive study on history and ancient civilizations, but I can read the Bible.  At first I was quite pleased with their faithfulness to the Biblical account, but then I believe the filmmakers departed from the written account on some of the most crucial details of the story.

At certain key points, Joseph was portrayed as incapable of standing on his own, apparently needing women to help him understand what was going on, to help him forgive his brothers, etc.  That's not the Joseph I read about.  Then Pharaoh needed women to convince him that Joseph knew what he was talking about.  That is not at all the case.  (And I am not against women.)  Pharaoh was the one who immediately recognized what was in Joseph.  Genesis 41:38  ""Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?""  He recognized that on the first encounter.  There was no second conversation with Joseph about the dreams.  Pharaoh did not dismiss him on the first encounter.

What was the point of rushing down to get Joseph when he was brought back to Pharaoh, stripping his clothes off, and having two young ladies wash him from behind?  I don't read that anyone tried to scare Joseph when they told him Pharaoh wanted to see him.  Genesis 41:14 says that ""they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and he shaved, changed his clothing, and came to Pharaoh.""

Another reviewer writes, ""Although some of the sexually explicit (though historically accurate) scenes should be screened from the very young...""  What about single or married, young or old guys, watching practically R rated scenes?  I don't think people other than children are immune from being provoked.  Does an interest in history and Bible stories have to subject us to sexually explicit material?

And what is the point of showing Joseph's wife in the bath?  I bet they had to shoot that scene repeatedly to keep from showing her breasts in the angles from the front, and it required split second timing in editing to keep from showing her behind as she was getting out of the pool.  Is that required to tell the story of Joseph?

Some of the rest of the material might make sense if it were called the story of Genesis.  But what does the story of Joseph have to do with Judah's escapade with Tamar?  Is that really an integral part of the story of Joseph?  I think the director was glad to have a little more material, having the opportunity to show a situation with someone preparing to make out with a harlot, showing all the way up to the point where she begins to lift her dress and bare her leg, leaving the rest to your imagination.

I will not dispute that two of Joseph's brothers wiped out all the males in a city as revenge for their sister being raped (Genesis 34).  Of course many details are up to the film maker, but it struck me as being unnecessary to show those same men saying, ""Praise be to God"" (or some such similar phrase) in one breath, and then plotting to kill all the males in the next breath.  Again, I'm not sure how critical that whole incident is to the story of Joseph.  Maybe it is--I won't argue too much on that point.

And the Jacob (Joseph's father) we see in the film is not the Jacob I imagine.  He looked pretty weak, lacking in self-confidence, and lacking in confidence in God.  I don't think Jacob was quite so timid.  That's my personal reading of the scriptures.

The story of Joseph is one of my favorite stories in the Bible, but I would like to forget most of what I saw.  For me, the scene where Joseph was reunited with his brothers was weak.  What about Joseph weeping aloud, and ""the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard it.""  (Genesis 45:2)  Couldn't the actor muster up that kind of emotion?

Seeing the film did help me to imagine a little better what it was like when certain things happened.  Joseph crying out from the pit was particularly poignant.  But I would not recommend this film to anyone.  To me, it's not an accurate representation of what happened, and it does not portray Joseph as the strong man of God that he was.

If you are watching this film to get a better understanding of the Bible, I think you should be careful. I don't think this movie was written by a Christian or directed by a Christian.  I think it could possibly just be a ploy to dupe gullible Christians into watching a sexually explicit movie (with historically accurate stuff mixed in), and slightly distorting their understanding of what actually happened.  I think we should be careful about who we rely on to interpret the Bible for us."
1340,5119367,5,As described and fast shipping.
1341,5119367,5,As described and fast shipping.
1342,5119367,5,"This is an accurate and realistic depiction of Scripture. It is nice to watch a Bible story that is not a cartoon and not an overacted, way too serious presentation. Bible heroes on film are often treated as if they walked on earth with a halo constantly hovering over them. This is a story about a man who follows God's heart through thick and thin (mostly thin), but you can relate to him because he is portrayed as an ordinary, albeit tremendously faithful, man."
1343,5119367,5,"THE MOVIE, JOSEPH, FROM THE BIBLE COLLECTION WAS SIMPLY A GREAT MOVIE, ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE TEN COMMANDMENTS."
1344,5119367,5,An amazing true story that always touches my heart. This young man was truly someone to imitate. The movie sticks to the bible's account very well.
1345,5119367,5,"Magnificent acting, writing, directing, set design--the story is extremely compelling and the ending uplifting. It teaches many principles of virtue without in the least being preachy. There is much conflict, suspense, surprise, and believable twists in this absorbing drama. I watched it many times and learned many useful lessons from it. Buy it and enjoy it."
1346,5119367,5,"I had been looking for this video for a long time to copy from TV.

I am gald I thought to order it from Amazon. Its just what I was looking for."
1347,5119367,5,"THIS MOVIE WAS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE SEEN DEPICTING THE LIFE OF JOSEPH.
I AM ADDING IT TO MY COLLECTION OF MOVIES TO WATCH FREQUENTLY."
1348,5119367,5,"I just love this DVD, and the actors do a wonderful job of re-telling the beloved bible story of Joseph...  Well worth your time and money!"
1349,5119367,5,This is the best and most accurate rendition of Joseph's life.  This is great for the family.
1350,5119367,5,"Simply one of the best biblical stories as one of the best DVD ever done.  Praise God for this wonderful treasure.  After seeing it once on television, I fell in love with this movie.  The actors are excellent in interpreting the story of Joseph."
1351,5119367,5,"I am always skeptical of hollywood productions of anything true but this is about as good as it could get.  A few variations from the true story, but they were minor.  Their take on the issues surrounding this family demonstrates they listenend to the advice they got from Old Testament experts who actually believe the Bible.  It was not only well written, but the acting was superb!  We have read the biblical story many times, but found ourselves mesmerized by this movie version.  HIGHLY Recommend!"
1352,5119367,3,"Had it not been for the unnecessary(sexually charge scene of ""Joseph's bath time"" this movie would have remain a perfectly beautiful, classic family movie for christians.
Why should we be forced to view something that is not needed for the plot to be engrossing and tolerate the overabundant abuse of moral ethics even in christian movie making? I believe we deserve better, and it would be more beneficial for the industry if we could trust them to leave the ""garbage"" out!
There are still people like me that prefer clean entertaiment, and would have purchase several copies of this movie for gifts had it not been for this totally unnecessary scene."
1353,5119367,5,"I love this movie!!  I found that it is an excellent adaptation of the Biblical story.  It stays true to the Biblical story and provides additional insights on other aspects that weren't mentioned in the Bible.  The acting is terrific, and the sets give a good feel for the area and the times the story takes place in."
1354,5119367,5,The Series is awesome. We use it in our missionary work with indigenous peoples in Colombia. Very happy to be able to buy this type of material.
1355,5119367,5,"This is a great retelling of the traditional bible story without the usual religious preaching.  A good tale of triumph over adversity, in a big way.  Well known actors."
1356,5119367,5,This is one of my favorite Bible stories and this production is absolutely wonderful.
1357,5119367,5,"It's hard to believe Ted Turner had anything to do with this production. Certainly a credit to him. It's the best ""Joseph"" to date. A must see for the many Christians whose portrayal of God's man has not given credit to the true gospel. God's man was not ""full of himself,"" nor did he ever think himself better than his brothers, although his character was much better than theirs. The Lord God had chosen the right man for the job..."
1358,5119367,5,"This is by far my most favorite of the ""Bible Collection"" movies. It is done very well, and yes there are a few scenes that get a little steamy, the movie should be reviewed by parents before deciding to let the kids view it without being ready to hit the fast forward button.

As far as I can tell it is biblically accurate and really brings to life this great old story.

You will see and understand this story in a whole new light after viewing this masterpiece.

I have seen this film many many times and the ending still gets me wiping away the tears from my eyes.

This is truly a great movie and you will not be disappointed!"
1359,5119367,4,"This was an excellent video.  It was a bit too steamy in the scenes with Potiphar's wife trying to seduce Joseph (too much for kids). However that did not negate it scriptural accuracy of the story line.

The sets were a bit sparse feeling, however it did not take away from the fact that this was a well-directed and produced movie.

Enjoy!"
1360,5119367,5,"This is another excellent addition to TNT's Bible collection. It tells the story of Joseph, the son who rose from a slave to the Viceroy of Egypt.

Joseph is the favored son of his father, a fact which causes no small amount of jealousy from his other brothers. It eventually causes so much resentment that they sell him as a slave to a passing caravan and tell his father that he was killed. In slavery, he is taken to Egypt. His intelligence and honest are both a curse to him and a blessing. Through God's favor, and Joseph's steadfastness, he rises to a position of immense power. When his brothers come to him, seeking help, they do not recognize him and the stage is set for either reconciliation or terrible retribution.

The story is well done and is in keeping with the scriptures. At first, it can be a bit confusing because it relies on flashbacks that are not always immediately apparent but this is soon gotten over. The result is a good story done well."
1361,5119367,5,"I was extremely skeptical when this movie came out.  I mean, what kind of movie can Bible-basher Ted Turner produce on one of the great heroes of the Bible - Joseph?  Boy was I wrong.  This is one of my all-time favorite movies and the best part is it faithfully tells the story directly out of the Bible with very few Hollywood additions.  The acting is great.  The actors are well known and correctly cast.  Even the unknown lead of Joseph (Paul Mercurio) does a wonderful job.  Even the scenes and settings are wonderful.  Two thumbs way up!!

For fans of this movie, look for other TNT offerings in this series - Moses, Abraham, David, Jacob, and others.  Most of them are equally good - with I think David being my next favorite followed by Abraham."
1362,5119367,5,"I would have to say that this is one of the best ""made-for-TV"" (on TNT) biblical films I've seen. The acting was phenominal, the scenery..EVERYTHING. This movie is dead-on when it comes to accuracy from the Bible, which is pretty rare..almost unheard of in this day in age. It's a refreshing movie that has an honest, uplifting theme that will inspire you and your family. It could have easily been released in the theaters and it probably could have been bigger in popularity with a wider-span of audience around the world. Even so, I'm just glad that I can now buy the DVD! :)"
1363,5119367,5,"As the title says, unbelievably good!  They included all the information that the Bible has about this period of time that is usually excluded from a traditional telling of the story of Joseph in Egypt.  This information helps explain why Jacob took the birthright away from the older boys and gave it to Joseph.  Ben Kingsley was magnificent as Potiphar and he had a great script to work from.  I felt that the attitudes and relationships between the characters was very real.  Paul Mercurio was very good as Joseph and Joseph's manner was always respectful and submissive to those over him, which always worked to his benefit in the end.  Joseph's family scenes showed a very wonderful relationship with his wife, Asenath.  The movie is three hours long because I believe originally it was a made-for-cable mini-series.  Well worth sitting through."
1364,5119367,5,"This film is a recounting of the Genesis tale of Joseph.  Joseph is the most loved son of his father, and has a gift for prophecy.  His older brothers hate him because of it and sell him into slavery.  Joseph winds up in Egypt where he eventually becomes the second most powerful man in the kingdom after the Pharoah.  During a famine, Joseph's brothers come to Egypt begging for grain, not knowing that the man who will decide their fate is their brother (whom they believe to be dead).  This is one of a series of made for TV movies about important figures in the Old Testament.  I've previously reviewed several other stories in this series, but this is the best of a strong series in my view.  The acting is top notch, and I found the final confrontation between Joseph and his brothers to be particularly moving and well done.  Like many of the films in this series, it is a story about faith and perserverance.  The writer and producer did a particularly good job of fleshing out the story of Joseph from Genesis without adding lots of non-Biblical threads.  One thing that I like about this movie (and about the series as a whole) is that they are not overdone.  These aren't special effects-laden films with casts of thousands, but rely on writing and good acting to convey the tale.  The sets and the costumes are realistic and give the film a Biblical feel without being ostentatious.  The bottom line is that this is, in my opinion, the way that the Bible should be brought to film."
1365,5119367,5,"This entire series of Bible stories by this Italian production group is simply splendid.  These are relatively low cost films but they are very skillfully produced to maximize the quality of the story being told.  Of course we Christians and Jews will sit around and pontificate about every little error or short cut the movie script incurs, never the less, it is ultimately left to the actors and directors and their considerable skill to pull off what I consider to be, for the most part, some of the most successfully done Bible story dramatizations that have ever been produced on film, with or without a big budget.  My favorite is the story of Abram, the movie Joseph coming in a close second, and this movie, Moses, coming in a close third or even equalling Joseph.  Bravo bravo - Please make more!  My five stars applies to this complete series of movies - Obviously some are done a little better than others, but the effort is exemplary."
1366,5119367,5,I think it is safe to say that I have seen every movie or TV presentation of the story of Joseph.  It is one of my favorites.  This particular story with Ben Kingsley is by far the best I have have ever seen.  The first time I watched the story I borrowed it from a friend.  I was so impressed that I bought my own copy. To date I have watched the movie a minimum of 10 times.  I never tire of watching this movie.  Thank you for allowing me to share my story.
1367,5119367,5,"This Bible story blesses me everytime I see it, and I've seen it a lot.

Great cast and they all do a fantastic job. If you like movies about overcomming obsticles and having faith, THIS IS THE ONE!!!!"
1368,5119367,5,"Amazing!

None better than Timur Yusef. An outstanding young actor. I wonder what he's doing now....."
1369,5119367,4,"This was one of the best movie from a Old Testament Biblical story.  The only problem with this is the nude scene when ""Joseph"" was nude in the water.  I think  this could have been left out and the story would had been perfect."
1370,5119367,5,"This is probably THE best religious film I have ever seen. Normally I complain about them, and they are usually done very low budget with completely unknown actors who cannot act. Joseph, however was done very well. The sets were historically accurate, and the filmmakers made sure to put detail into everything they did. They also left nothing out. Every little detail from the Joseph story is here, in their greusome details. Ben Kingsley does an excellent job as Potiphar and Potiphars wife is equally good and vile. Joseph himself is everything you would expect Joseph to be, humble, handsome, smart, and spiritual. Wonderfully Done."
1371,5119367,5,I LOVED this movie. It was very well made and held my interest from beginning to end.
1372,5119367,5,"This is rather a question.

I love this movie since I bought the original VHS version (2 tapes) that is 185 minutes long total (a little over 90 minutes each tape).  I am reading that this DVD version is only 145 minutes.  40 minutes have been cut off?

Today, August 5, many days after I wrote the above question, I can give an answer myself.  I got the DVD.  The run time specified by the manufacturer or distributor is incorrect.  The length of the DVD is 185 minutes exactly, just like the original VHS version."
1373,5119367,4,"A truly wonderfully made film, mostly accurate to scripture and brilliantly acted. Joseph's brothers are the stars here in their own right but Paul Mecurio is in fine form as well."
1374,5119367,5,"This movie was very well done- one of the best by this company.  Just remember the story and don't watch it with your kids because they were very accurate about what happened with Potiphar's wife and Joseph's garment being left behind as well as the fact that she had been continually tempting him prior to this encounter.  Also, they kept to the historical feautures in that the women wore fine linen that is fairly see-through.  The only scene I remember being unhappy with was the baker beating Joseph in the prison (Not Biblical) and it isn't 3 days till they are brought out, though it may be that long till the events are otherwise fulfilled.  There were a few other minor changes like that but none damaged the historical perspective. Also, I wish they had included Judah's offer of protection to Benjamin and his, therefore, being the one to offer himself in Benjamin's place.  They show one offer but I assumed that was the other brother who made the initial offer and was refused since it was right when they got back to their father, just as the Bible portrays it."
1375,5119367,5,"""Joseph"" is an epic motion picture; another excellent and inspiring Bible story which was creatively and sensitively produced. It traces the story of Joseph in Genesis and brings it to life in a powerful and compelling way.

This film did a good job of interpretation the Biblical story on the life of Joseph. The production is superb and settings are excellent. Everyone of the cast was perfect for their parts. Paul Mercurio plays Joseph exceptionally well. Equally impressive is Lesley Ann Warren who plays as Potiphar's lewd wife who unsuccessfully attempts to ensnare Joseph. Also marvellous to watch is Martin Landau (Jacob) and Joseph's eleven brothers. The supporting cast was fantastic.

Although I have read the story of Joseph, this film brings it to life and reinforces my understanding of it. I thoroughly enjoyed the film which was very well done.

The only area that one may criticize is the very white actors when in fact the people at the time were much darker in complexion. However, this shortcoming is compensated by the accuracy of the actual biblical account of the story which is rare in many biblical productions.

Overall impression: a pleasant and well acted movie that was a joy to watch that I highly recommend for those who need to reinforce their knowledge of the Bible and appreciate a well-done movie based on it."
1376,5119367,4,"A well known story, pleasantly done -- and serves as a good reminder of some important parts of my heritage. Glad I purchased a copy. The acting was decent."
1377,5119367,5,"Perhaps the most Biblically acurate presentation of scripture I've ever seen.  An outstanding cast, well directed and even a brilliantly composed musical score.  One of my absolute favorite stories in the Bible really came to life in this presentation.  I would recommend this film for families, Bible studies and Sabbath/Sunday school classes."
1378,5119367,5,"In my opinion I think Joseph is a great movie, its very well acted, casted, it tells the story very well keeps you very interested till the very end. if fact your almost sorry to see it end! I kinda wanted to hear more! it also teaches you about a story in the bible, it was fab!! loved it as you can tell! my kids love it too!!"
1379,5119367,5,"This movie is a must see.  Oh my gosh, I'm still breathless.  The characters and the depictions were so close to the scripture until it was unbelievable.  I grabbed my bible just to follow along with the movie.  I particularly love the way that the story regarding Judah and his daughter-in-law is placed smack dab in the middle of the entire Joseph story.  Initially from just reading the bible I couldn't quite understand how a portion of the scripture would focus on Joseph, then the focus is taken immediately off him and it's placed upon Judah and Tamar.  Then it goes immediately back to focusing on Joseph.  God's written word is obviously trying to make a point and show a comparison.  The movie grabbed even the smallest details from the scriptures; for example the stranger in the desert that suddenly asks Joseph who he's looking.

I purchased a used movie that was in SUPER, Good, like NEW shape and to boot, the movie was inspiring, educational and so real.

It's a must see ........."
1380,5119367,5,"The series are amazing! Thank God such biblical figures are protrayed with the  Lord God as foundation.

I was expecting those usual blurry versions, but this is entirely different. Its a way to invite friends and know the characters in the bible and how they can relate that man in his nature is sinful and only through the Lord's grace can we only be part of the family.  The story shows the fallen nature of man---jealousy, anger etc and it also shows that God knows the heart of men and gives according to His own glory.

Watch it!"
1381,5119367,5,Joseph is my favorite movie out of the Bible Collection. I am going to get one movie at a time as I can afford it until I have the whole collection.
1382,5119367,5,"Great great great! As with many of the other titles in the Bible Collection,  I've watched this film several times and the emotions I am left with after watching it never diminish. Another production that remains true to the historic account, this movie was casted brilliantly and told superbly. Before I ever read the story of Joseph in the Old Testament, I had watched this film. This movie did an excellent job of re-telling the story. Highly recommended."
1383,5119367,5,"I still break down in tears when Joseph reveals himself to his brothers no matter how many times I watch this. Of all the Bible movies made, this in my opinion is simply the best one out there. Great cast of actors. Awesome story. God is great!"
1384,5119367,5,"Although I had enjoyed the Bible movies that were broadcast by Turner on TNT, ""Joseph"" turned out to be a cut above the rest in regard to the scope of the production, the writing, and the performances of the actors. It really seemed to capture the essence of the story in the book of Genesis."
1385,5119367,5,"I very highly recommend this movie.  The role of Joseph is beautifully portrayed by Paul Mercurio.  It's one of the best Biblical stories that I've ever seen on TV.  I'm so happy that I now own the DVD.  And it doesn't hurt that Paul Mercurio is a very handsome young man.  If you're at all interested in what is written in the Bible and appreciate a well-done movie based on it, get this movie!  My further wish is that more like it will be made in the future."
1386,5119367,5,Great movie.  Quick transaction.  Item arrived promptly and in excellent condition.
1387,5119367,5,"This is the finest Biblical epoch we have ever seen, including Ben Hur and 10 Commandments.  A low budget testament to the power of imagination and good acting.  Remarkably faithful to both to historical and scriptural sources, the script brings life to an  already marvelous tale of alienation, faith and redemption.  The tragic family of Isaac is beautifully portrayed with every character (including all 12 brothers) skillfully defined."
1388,5119367,5,"This is an incredible mini-series...but it might not be so great if the run time stated (145 minutes) is accurate for the DVD release.  The length of this production (at least on the VHS version) was 185 minutes.  I plan to verify that this was not severely edited before I purchase it.  There is some hope insofar as Warners Home Video has a history of understating (or miscalculating) run times...The miniseries ""North And South"" had a run time misprint that amounted to 183 minutes--over 3 hours!!  The material was not missing or edited...just the info on the box was in error.  Hopefully, that's what's happened here.  Besides, ""Abraham"" is being released the same day fully intact...why not ""Joseph?""

UPDATE:  The run time as stated on the actual packaging IS 187 minutes.  Actually, the film runs 3 hours and 5 minutes as per the DVD player itself.  So, it seems, NOTHING has been edited for the DVD release.  The box also says ""Special Features not rated or closed captioned""...but there are NO special features.  Just some language and subtitle selections.  Now, I can't wait to watch it again.  Thanks, Warners..for not butchering this fantastic production."
1389,5119367,5,"Joseph is the ideal role model for EVERY Christian/Jew. He is an example of what we should strive for. Waiting for a spouse to have sex. Sticking to your God no matter the outcome. This movie reflects all of that perfectly. The actors did a great job. When I first saw this years ago I was blown away by the quality!! That was back in the VHS days...cant wait to see it on DVD. So I cant speak for the transfer quality yet, sorry."
1390,5119367,5,"Although I have enjoyed most of the movies in the Bible Collection Joseph has been my all time favorite.  It is biblically accurate, events that are not recounted in the Bible are kept beleivalbe for the time period.  The guy who plays Joseph does a wonderful job.  In fact it was this movie that ruined the movie Moses, Ben Kingsley does a wonderful job as Potiphar in Joseph, but is just to old and not right for the part of Moses.

I am so glad that this movie will finally be out on DVD.  They have been available overseas for a long time in DVD format.  I am glad they are begining to release these on DVD, hopefully David will come out soon."
1391,5119367,5,"This WONDERFUL film is a total treat on every level! I admit my reason for the first viewing was strictly as an enthusiast of films set in ancient Egypt. On this level, the film is probably the best I've seen to recreate what that era must have really been like. The sets and costumes have a complete feel of reality, unlike the many  ""Hollywoodized"" Egyptian ventures. But, that's not the reward I got by the end of the film. It's as much a tear-jerker as the old Ross Hunter/Lana Turner films! And, the performances, especially that of Paul Mercurio in the title role, (WHY don't we see more work from him?), Martin Landau as his father Jacob, Ben Kingsly as the Egyptian over-seer Pontiphur, and Lesly Ann Warren as his wife, are exceptional! There is even a most erotically charged scene or two between Pontiphur's adulteress wife and a scantily clad Joseph. Most everyone already knows the story. Joseph is the favored son of his father, inspiring lethal jealousy from his other sons, Joseph's brothers. They conspire to get rid of Joseph, but can't bring themselves to actually kill him, so they sell him into slavery. He ends up in Egpyt and, over the years, thanks to his talent for explaining the meanings of dreams, rises to a position of power second only to Pharaoh. Circumstances reunite Joseph with his brothers, although they don't know who he is. The revelation of his identity to them and his reunion with his father will touch the heart of anyone who has one! Originally shown as a 2-part TV mini-series by TNT a few years ago, I'm eagerly awaiting the DVD release - uninterrupted by commercials, and including a making-of featurette. Don't let this jewel get by you!"
1392,5119367,5,"When this film debuted in 1994 as a miniseries on television, at a time when biblical stories were being made into miniseries, I was skeptical because I had been disappointed in the stories of Abraham and Jacob.

This film, though, is the best filmed biblical interpretation of the life of Joseph.  It is truly astounding with a stellar cast!  Paul Mercurio is incomparable as Joseph and deserved an emmy for his performance.  He tears the heart right out of you!  No less superb is Lesley Ann Warren as Potiphar's lascivious wife who tries to snare him into her web but fails.

This film is incredible and not to be missed!  I always cry buckets of tears at the end!  A true masterpiece in every way!"
1393,5119367,4,"I truly enjoyed this film.  I think it was superbly done, however, I did not agree with the scene between Joseph and Potipher's wife. I think it was a bit too sexy and it was not necessary.  This scene does not make it suitable for younger audiences and I think that is a shame because it is such a great movie.  However, that was the only scene where I saw Hollywood getting carried away."
1394,5119367,5,"Though this interpretation of Joseph's life has been substantially embellished, the heart and soul of the story remain intact, and is ultimately quite faithful to the Biblical account covered in Genesis Ch. 33:18 through Ch. 46:30.
Much of the acting is marvelous, especially Ben Kingsley as Potiphar, whose part has thankfully been enlarged, because he is riveting in every scene he is in.
Martin Landau is also excellent as the patriarch Jacob, who mourns the apparent loss of his favorite son, Joseph.
Australian actor/dancer Paul Mercurio (""Strictly Ballroom"") is good in the lead, and others in the cast include Leslie Ann Warren as Potiphar's lying wife, the always beautiful Dominique Sanda as Leah, and some fine character actors playing Joseph's brothers, notably Michael Attwell (Judah), and Vincenzo Nicoli (Simeon).
Included in this film, and intrinsic to Joseph's life are the stories of Tamar and Judah, and the horrific tale his sister Dinah, both done effectively. The only parts that are less than first-rate are the scenes in Pharoah's court; almost campy in costuming and acting, they can provide some amusement in the midst of all the drama. Stefano Dionisi is a most unlikely and modern looking Pharoah, and has the ultimate babe for a wife, the pulchritudinous Monica Bellucci. The entire film though, is always mentally and visually entertaining, and has much spiritual content. As with so much of the Old Testament, there are allegories that run through its narrative that point to the New Testament, and the story of Joseph has much of this symbolism.
Filmed in Quarzazate, Morocco, with its exotic ancient structures and landscapes, the cinematography by Rafaele Mertes is wonderful; this is a way above average production for television, and a film about a man who ""does nothing against his conscience even on pain of death"" is worth watching again and again."
1395,5119367,5,I bought this film after seeing most of it on A&E. This film is by far the best way to see Joseph. The settings are beautiful and the entire look of the production are perfect in presenting the story. The casting choices could not have been better! Paul Mercurio is a perfect Joseph. Everyone of the cast was perfect for their parts. This film is the best Joseph movie to date.
1396,5119367,5,"This is absolutely one of the best produced and acted Bible stories around. It's accuracy, acting and pacing set a new standard for Bible-based productions. Bible scholars will not be offended, and movie buffs will not be disappointed. It tightens my throat at the end every time. I strongly recommend this for your Bible movie collection."
1397,5119367,5,"Having just seen this movie for the first time last night, I have to say that in spite of the very white actors in a culture that would clearly be darker in appearance, this movie in writing, production, and acting overcame that one glaring inconsistency with accuracy and with beauty.
Bible in hand, we marveled to see that this story followed the actual biblical account with astounding accuracy almost never seen in biblical productions.  Entirely enjoyable and a marvelously acted piece, my entire family loved this movie.  We had been expecting another biblical mish mash eliciting merely yawns, but were startled to see such a wonderful movie.
Martin Landau (Jacob) gave a fantastic performance, as did Ben Kingsley(Potiphar), Paul Mercurio(Joseph) (which bumps STRICTLY BALLROOM out of #1 on my Paul Mercurio list of favorite performances), Leslie-Anne Down was good as Potiphar's wife, and the 11 brothers of Joseph were fabulous.  The supporting cast was excellent.
The sensitive and well rounded way in which this story was handled was fresh, creative, yet took no liberties in veering from the original story.  Although it is not as spectacular in production as THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and other such movies, this movie was more like it ""really"" would have happened complete with humanity in all of its misery and magnificence.
I can not speak highly enough of this movie.  What a pleasant surprise.  We even got a chuckle out of it now and then!"
1398,5119367,5,"My God, i have never seen the story of Joseph in this light. I had no idea how commited, humble and faithful Joseph was in the bible. What watching this movie did for me is to reevalute my life and it caused me togo higher in intergrity at work, school and everywhere in my life and in addition, it made me realise how much everything i did was mediocre and how much i needed to live a life of excellence in everything that i did. It showed me that God is always faithful and that he is a rewarder of those who deligently seek him. Joseph suffered for like 13 years, but he spent the rest of his 70 something years in complete abundance in God. This movie has really been a blessing and i encourage everyone to get a copy of it. Believe me your life will never be the same."
1399,5119367,4,"This four hour video looks a the familiar ""Joseph"" story from the Bible but with a few wonderful twists.  First, it just jumps into the Egyptian setting.  Second most of the actors do a great job on their roles -- I want to say ""brava"" to Leslie Ann Warren for making Potiphar's wife engaging and even more scary than the original tale suggests.  Finally, the customs and backgrounds are the best yet that I've seen in a film version of the tale.  However, my ""four star"" rating refers to the ""flashback"" section of the film.  Yes, why it happens makes sense internally but did they need to spend so much time on it?  It very sad that Paul Mercurio's careers seems to have turned off onto the ""B"" grade track -- I think he is excellent in this movie and also in Exit to Eden."
1400,5119367,5,"""Joseph"" masterfully brings the pages of Genesis alive with the same grit, power, and passion of the Biblical narrative. The acting is of the highest quality, being highlighted by Ben Kingsley's brilliant portrayal of Potiphar. Despite some Hollywood license, ""Joseph"" remains true to the Biblical narrative, even including the sorted accounts involving Tamar and Dinah (which should mark the movie with a PG rating). It is an epic motion picture, lasting over 3 hours, but there is nothing I would have been left on the editing room floor. ""Joseph"" does have its weaknesses, yet the movie receives my very highest recommendation. In fact, it is so good, I consider it one of my all-time cinematic favorites. It left me inspired, encouraged, and in awe of God's faithfulness. You will not be disappointed!"
1401,5119367,5,"A very moving, realistic portrayal of the story of Joseph. With Ben Kingsley as Potiphar, great casting and dialog, it makes a part of Bible History come alive. The scene that discloses the seducing of Joseph is realistic without overdo. We watched this movie with our 16 and 17 year old children and discussed it afterward."
1402,5119367,5,"I have always enjoyed the story of Joseph and it is so good to actually see a excellent movie version that is accurate according to scriptures. The acting was excellent also and each individual played their part very well, even Potiphar's wife.
As for Potiphar himself? the bible never said anything against him and the actor lived up to that. It is a brilliant story with so much purpose and meaning and i'm sorry to say it but, have those tissues ready when Joesph reveals himself to his brothers and when Jacob finally comes to egypt to meet him after twenty years.  PS: Better have that box of tissues nearby"
1403,5119367,5,"One of the most oft recounted stories of betrayal and redemption of all time, that of patriarch Joseph at the hands of his envious and spiteful brothers, is retold once again in this film.  The film's greatest contribution to the story is the deep emotion that it conveys.  Viewers will actually feel the loss, the betrayal, the hopelessness, the anger, the love and the joy that these characters experience and convey.  Less overt but still present are the supernatural interventions by Joseph's God, a pivitol element of the story and certainly not lost in this picture.  The production is simple yet effective; neither flashy nor flaunting, it simply tells the story of how God acted in the life of one family whose descendant would one day change the world forever.  Highly recommended and deeply moving."
1404,5119367,5,"(I am actually Rich's son, Micah) I was first introduced to this video by my Greek/Hebrew professor and have been amazed by its Biblical accuracy. In uncommon fashion, it stays very close to the actual Biblical texts, without adding any sort of propoganda! At the same time, it is filmed very well and is presented in a very appealing fashion. For once, I have found a movie based on Scripture that is accurate! I would recommend it to any viewer, especially a Christian one."
1405,5119367,4,"Of all the TNT movies, this one is actually the weakest. But it is still a good movie. The movie covers the period before Esau sold his birthright and blessing to Jacob through his time with Laban and finally his confrontation with Laban and later Esau.
The disappointment with this movie was its over-focus on him and Rachel. The lessons God was teaching him were kind of talked about, but not focused on. The non-Scriptural parts, though, were pretty consistent with early Near Eastern customs and not contrary to Scriptural understanding. In that way, it was very good.
If you choose to watch this movie, you won't find yourself wishing you hadn't. It is a good movie and well produced. Just be sure you don't base much theology on it. ;-)
The movie is a solid PG movie."
1406,5119367,5,"This account of the Joseph story is as good as it gets! I teach ancient history and civilizations, and have an earned doctorate in theology. I say this only to lend perspective to this review.
This film is Biblically accurate, well-acted, and the producer and director are to be praised for the sound Biblical reasearch!
Although some of the sexually explicit (though historically accurate) scenes should be screened from the very young, this film is an ideal platform from which teens can search out characteristics of moral uprightness in a character of whom the Bible has not one negative thing to say!
Kingsley (as he did in 'Moses') steals the show, and Mercurio does an admirable job as Joseph. Only Leslie Ann Warren (Potipher's wife) seems to strain as an actor, nevertheless, her performance detracts little from the drama. Especially capable are the actors portraying Joseph's wicked brothers, with Vincenzo Nicoli sterling is his performance as the wicked Simeon.
Having watched the film dozens of times with adults--as well as with my middle-schoolers in the classroom, I can say that the greatest of Bible stories is captured in all its power, pathos, and glory. Although creating a few anachronistic vignettes (such as Joseph's 'foreshadowing' Christ's ""My God, my God..."" speech from the Egyptian prison), the film also captures all of the great ironies of the Joseph story.
When Mercurio tenderly reveals himself as the second most powerful man in the ancient world--to the brothers who hated him as a youth, the words 'I am Joseph' will not fail to bring even the most calloused heart to tears.
As my students synthesized the thirty or so characteristics of moral goodness extant in Joseph into an essay, one asked why no such heroes existed today. The question revealed both the effectiveness of this presentation, and the dearth of role models in our society.
'Joseph' is both gripping in narration, and brilliant its direction. It is faithful to Scripture and well-acted. It is THE finest of the TNT productions to date, of which only one ('Jacob') was a failure.
Everyone will appreciate this wonderful story of forgiveness, but those those who are looking for the 'hidden things of Christ' cannot miss the poignant messianic threads which are so skillfully woven through the life of Joseph. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
1407,5119367,5,"This excellent production is without doubt the  best version of the Joseph story that I've ever seen, treating fully and thoughtfully every aspect of this greatest ever ""rags to riches"" tale. It shows very clearly  why Joseph is a truly great hero figure : Firstly, he distinguished himself  by service and respect, to God, to his human master, and to his people (in  that fixed order), putting himself a poor fourth; this contrasts sharply to  many other so-called great men of history who
distinguished themselves  through conquest. Secondly, he overcame all of the serious setbacks in his  troubled life, as opposed to most of us, who are overcome by our  disasters.
The production is basically very faithful to the Biblical  account, and even tries to explain the more puzzling aspects of the story,  such as Potiphar's ambivalent judgement after the ""rape"", or why  Joseph never sought out his father after he achieved greatness. It also  tries to show the Egyptian/Hebrew language barrier at times. The  final  parts are somewhat paraphrased, to save running time, but are still  faithful to the essence of the story.
The performances of Ben Kingsley  (Potiphar) and Martin Landau (Jacob) are superb, and Paul Mercurio  (Joseph), despite his necessary youth and therefore less experience, does a  good job,  although his ""body language"" often outdoes his spoken  one.
There are however a few negatives, such as the below-par sets and  costumes, indicating perhaps a somewhat spartan budget. Also, Joseph's  meteoric rise to governor not only features a poorly type- cast actor for  Pharoh, but would have been far  more plausible if his achievements in  organizing  Potiphar's house and Pharoh's prison were cited. Also, the  distinction between slave and servant / commoner is blurred throughout; and  the chronology of the story, with all those periods of ""7 years"",  is not always the most probable one.
But overall this is an excellent,  well recommended telling of the story of Joseph the Patriach."
1408,5119367,4,"I thought that this film was really good, i just wish they had made it sutible for children by cutting out a few things and putting some clothes on the egyptian women.  I really liked the  end, it was so good, best part  in the entire movie and worth buying just for that. This movie made the  story so real especialy when Joseph's brothers throught him in the pit, it  makes you realize just how hard it was for him, that his own family would  betray him.  And to the person that said that Joseph's brothers didn't like  him because he was a proud arrogant tattle tale that is so un-true.  His  brother's hated him because he obeyed their father and because Jacob loved  Joseph more than them.  Joseph was ALWAYS faithful and obeyed God. He was  sold into Egypt not because he needed to be straightened out, but because  God had a plan to save all the land from famine including Joseph's family."
1409,5119367,5,"Considering that I am not an expert on the Old Testiment, I will spare you any in depth analysis of the accuracy of this film. Suffice it to say, I found nothing contradictory to what I learned in Sunday School.
That out  of the way... This is a wonderfully entertaining film. Although I knew  exactly what was going to happen next, I discovered that I was very anxious  to actually see how the events would be played out in the film. I was  especially impressed with the character development of the brothers. Rather  than as a group being presented as a single antagonist, they were presented  as 10 distinct individuals. It was interesting to me to view their  interaction with each other. The actors who portrayed Simeon and Judah  delivered exceptionally strong performances.
Paul Mercurio was perfect as  Joseph, and I must admit, he's rather easy on the eyes (thankfully since he  spent so much of the film dressed in just that teenie tiny little towel)
Ben Kingsley and Martin Landau are both convincnig in their rolls as  Potiphar and Jacob respectively.
With its compelling story, top notch  performances, and  bits seduction, mayhem, and adventure, Joseph is sure to  entertain, if not inspire, even the most skeptical viewers."
1410,5119367,5,"This movie was one of the most touching movies I have ever seen in my life. I am 39 years old and have seen alot of movies in my life. Joseph really help me understand God's love and forgiveness. Joseph was rejected  by his own family, as Jesus was rejected by his own people and mankind. As  cruel as Joseph's brother's were, Joseph still forgave them and took them  back, and saved them from dying. This kind of love is the love of Jesus has  for us, and how he still forgives us, even after we may of once rejected  him in our lives. Its a must see awesome lesson on love and forgiveness,  which we all need. If we need be saved by his precious love."
1411,5119367,5,"I thought this movie was incredible. I am a fourteen-year-old who has read the Joseph story many times in my life. I was so breath taken by this movie and watched it over and over again. It gave me a new understanding of this  story. I couldn't believe this movie. I was in awe every time I watched it  and I would rewind it and watch it again. I would watch it and just sob and  sob at the faithfulness of this man. It helped me raise a better  understanding in faith in our Heavenly Father at all times. It gripped me  in a way that I became addicted to it. I will never get enough of this  movie. If I had to suggest one movie to anyone, this would be it. It is the  #1 recommended movie on my list."
1412,5119367,5,"Even my husband enjoyed this movie. We stayed glued to the screen until the end. Wonderful cast, and the script stayed very close to the Word. Awesome film"
1413,5119367,5,"As soon as the film was finished, I rewound it and watched it again.  The filming was masterful in catching the essence of this well loved story...and successful in bringing out the ""punch line"": 'God is  soverign over all things,' and ""He works all things for good to those  who love Him and are called according to His purpose."" Wonderful  costuming, tremendous acting, and realistic settings.... I cried and cried."
1414,5123968,4,"My 18 month old loves this video. She dances, marches, and ""sings"" along.  She wants to watch it every day, and I don't even mind because the songs are catchy, classic and its fun to see her having fun. She'll literally turn the TV off during Barney, Wiggles and other music videos for kids...she doesn't really care for TV at all but the ""Cedarmont Kids"" is the one thing she will watch! (We like ""Toddler Tunes"" and ""Silly Songs"" though, by the same singing, dancing kids just a tad better but I had to buy this for some variety on the tube!)"
1415,5123968,5,We bought this dvd for viewing on a road trip but it has become a staple in our 2 year old's life.  Not all of the songs have actual motions but there are children laughing and singing and moving around and she is enthralled.  She sings along with the show but also sings them on her own throughout the day.  We have more of the Cedarmont videos and I love the fact that they do not repeat songs on different videos.
1416,5123968,1,"I was very disappointed, they all were the same songs. Big waste of money."
1417,5123968,4,I wish it had more actions the kids just march around mostly
1418,5123968,5,My boys love it!
1419,5123968,5,My toddler sings and dances with the songs.
1420,5123968,5,Classic
1421,5123968,4,"Kids like these, but they are so dated and over the top cheesy it's a little hard for mommy to watch."
1422,5123968,5,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my one year old niece, so I have not actually seen the cd yet. (I will watch it with her and probably enjoy it as much as she will however.) My niece loves music and likes to watch little children on tv or videos, so I am sure this will be a big hit."
1423,5123968,5,Perfect for my 6 month old grandchild.  HE LOVES IT.
1424,5123968,5,Kids want us to play this over and over on car trips! They also asked our nanny to play it when they get picked up from school.
1425,5123968,5,Great video
1426,5123968,5,Super good DVD for little ones!
1427,5123968,5,Love it!!
1428,5123968,5,All these Cedarmont Kids DVDs are awesome and loved at our house!
1429,5123968,5,"Exactly as advertised, thank you!"
1430,5123968,3,"Actually, the CD has great actions and songs.  Unfortunately, cannot alter the order in which they play on a play list, or incorporate it with other songs, so it is of limited value to us in our Sunday School ministry."
1431,5123968,3,Songs are good but need a bit more diversity.  I would like my kids to see other kids that look like them in more than just a random passing image.
1432,5123968,1,This Video is really dated. It's also not user friendly.
1433,5123968,5,Great for Sunday School classes with young kids!
1434,5123968,5,Loved it.
1435,5123968,3,Not really action songs.
1436,5123968,5,Received product ordered as advertised.
1437,5123968,5,Very good.
1438,5123968,5,My 20 month old granddaughter is mesmerised by this DVD. She loves dancing and doing the hand motions with the kids. Love it!
1439,5123968,5,great tool for teaching kids at church
1440,5123968,5,"Granddaughter loved them, thanks."
1441,5123968,5,Great songs
1442,5123968,5,kids love it.
1443,5123968,5,Nice
1444,5123968,5,The songs I grew up singing and now my grandson loves them!!!
1445,5123968,5,"My two year old grandson loves to watch the children and sing along.  Even my 10 month old granddaughter is enthralled by the cheerful colors and activity.  I definitely recommend any of the
Cedarmont Kids DVDs."
1446,5123968,4,"Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas.  The content is great, however for the money it needs a few more songs.  Some just repeated themselves too much.  Should have added a couple more.  Still, it is worth the four stars if you want good Christian content for your kids."
1447,5123968,5,My granddaughter wore one of these out already. It's fun to watch and sing along to. Much better than some of the junk for children.
1448,5123968,1,This is not a sing along dvd and it was difficult to understand some of the words being sung. I would not recommend it.
1449,5123968,5,"I had seen the advertisement and wanted to purchase it through amazon.com and received the item on time and my daughter enjoyed it very much, It was a surprise gift for her :)."
1450,5123968,5,My one year old grandson watches this over and over and over and over. It always brings a smile to his face when I put it on for him. It was well worth the money just to see that smile and watch him dance to his favorite songs.
1451,5123968,5,"I bought this for my two year old little boy.  He loves it.  In fact, sometimes I find him singing the songs on his own."
1452,5123968,5,"yes we are very happy with are Action Bible Songs, thank you, my Grand daughters love all three DVD's thank-you Cedarmont Kids"
1453,5123968,5,"I bought this to use in my Sunday School class and the kids love it.  I was hoping for my hand movements to go with the songs and that's not what this DVD is, but the kids were still mesmerized by it!"
1454,5123968,4,Bought it for my grandchildren.  I had it for my daughter when she was young but gave it away after she out grew it.  Now I had to have it for my grandchildren to enjoy.  My daughter and I still sing the songs from it and she is 17 yrs old now.
1455,5123968,5,"My daughter (2 years) absolutely loves this dvd!  She asks to watch almost daily.  She loves her ""Bible Songs"" as she calls them.  Highly recommended!"
1456,5123968,5,"My 4 year old loves this video. He knew 3 or 4 of the 17 songs on the video, and I was unsure how he'd take to the whole 17 song video...  Many times these videos are not produced well... But my fears were washed away after my son sat through the first viewing happily, and then wanted to watch the video AGAIN right away.  He watched it a second time (30 mins is the perfect legnth) and was content. Good choice on my part, this is a GREAT video.

It's interesting to see the kids in the video, who are all great performers, by the way... while the clothes are clearly from 1995 (i guessed 1994), the production, song choices and approach are 100% timeless. This video does not show its age. It's that good.

I recommend it for older toddlers and preschoolers...Kindergartners would also enjoy it.. ages 2 to 6 would be a perfect target audience. They are all Christian songs that Christian kids will love. Even my wife and I enjoyed the joy in the songs.

Highly recommended!"
1457,5123968,5,My 2-yr old daughter loves these videos and excitedly sings along.  Well done!  It's real kids doing what kids like to do.
1458,5123968,5,My two 17 month old babies LOVE this DVD and recently they are starting to immitate the moves and sing a long a few words in the song. One of them now likes to start our nighttime prayer with a song (Jesus love the little one like me)The only thing they can say from it til now is me me me and you you you you:-)
1459,5123968,3,The singing and actions are ok. Was a little disappointed that the singing and the lip movement does not always match.
1460,5123968,4,"I needed something Christian to keep my 1 year old daughter occupied while I worked, and this DVD has worked like a charm. She sits through the whole thing. She loves it when we sing the songs back to her when on a long drive or even when she's just generally cranky. Basically, the DVD has served the purpose for which it was chosen. We are very happy with the purchase. We recently bought another collection in the Cedarmont series that has 100 songs in it. Waiting to try it out."
1461,5123968,5,"The song selections are pretty good - they seem to stick in your head for better or worse.  Truth be told, I remember most of the songs from Sunday School and bible camp when I was a kid (e.g., This Little Light of Mine, Father Abraham, I'm in the Lord's Army, etc.) In all, it's good ""wholesome"" Christian music sung by colorful, busy kids doing busy kid stuff which captures any toddler/pre-schooler's attention.  And I'd much rather my kids be memorizing the lyrics on this dvd than the stuff they might hear on the radio. We've already worn out one dvd, and we're on our second.  This is definitely a favorite in our house."
1462,5123968,5,I love it and so does my son! It came very quick in the mail too!
1463,5123968,5,This is my second cd.  My grandkids wore out the first.  They love it.  It has all the favorites.
1464,5123968,5,"My 2 year old granddaughter and I have watched this DVD for a while now and she simply loves it! The purchase was for a relative who just turned 1 year old. He loves it, too! Lots of fun and we enjoy singing along with the kids in the video. (action packed)"
1465,5123968,4,"Our 20-month-old and 4.5-year-old love this video that contains many of the favorite Bible songs I remember from my childhood.  The music and singing is good quality, and the scenes behind the music are interesting -- children playing, acting out some of the words, like rock climbing during ""Climb up Sunshine Mountain"" -- even a farm full of animals during the Noah song.

Unfortunately, only a few of the songs feature all of the actions (hand motions and body movement) that make these songs favorites for children.  It's such a shame, because the primary reason I bought this DVD was to encourage full-body participation and movement instead of passive viewing.

Still, the production is good-quality (not overproduced and grating like the DVD of the same name by Golden Books).  When our kids leave it on and walk away, it actually makes decent background music, as children's music goes.

To be sure, this is the best children's music DVD we own (yes, even more popular with our kids than the Wiggles) -- that is, until we find a DVD of action Bible songs that actually features the actions."
1466,6486576,4,"This film is taken right from the book of Luke which many believe to be the book of the Bible that gives the most complete and accurate picture of Jesus' life.  If you watch the movie with a Bible open to Luke you'll be able to follow right along.  Brian Deacon plays the most believable Jesus (other than Robert Powell in the 1977 mini-series ""Jesus of Nazareth) in any film, especially those done recently.  The only drawback to this film is that it is quite wordy and at times moves slowly.  The crucifiction scenes, however, are very, very powerful.  ""Jesus"" has been shown worldwide to over 1 billion people and it has been translated into over 400 different languages.  Until recently, this film has not been widely available and I'm thrilled that Amazon.com has made it more readily available.  I highly recommend ""Jesus"" to anyone who wants an accurate visual telling of the story of Jesus' life without the use of ""dramatic license"" as has been the trend recently."
1467,6486576,5,"This movie is so great! This film shows a different side of Jesus, a wonderful side. It was a whole lot better than the other ""Jesus"" films...."
1468,6486576,5,This is an excellent movie portraying Jesus in His humanity.  We see how He laughed and danced and was tempted in every way and yet remained sinless.  It brings the viewer into the reality of His total human side.  We see Him in such a way that one can relate their human-ness with His.
1469,6486576,5,"YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN, GET BAPTIZED AND HAVE HOLY SPIRIT ABIDING IN YUR HEART."
1470,6486576,5,a great movie for the kids!
1471,6486576,5,"So true to the Bible.
JESUS IS LORD! <3"
1472,6486576,5,One of the best films ever produced.
1473,6486576,5,"I had a copy of he video for decades which eventually wore out!  It is the best video or DVD I have ever seen on the life and ministry of Jesus and I use it not only for personal delight, but also as an educational tool for my grand kids and now, great grand kid.  The story of Jesus never changes..
Wish there was a DVD as well.  Thanks"
1474,6486576,5,touching; A++++++++
1475,6486576,5,Met all expectations and more!
1476,6486576,5,:)
1477,6486576,5,Nice to buy good and cheap movies.
1478,6486576,5,Jesus follows the Bible quite close I should say the Book Of Luke.
1479,6486576,5,"Classic, true-to-the Bible.  It's been translated into many languages and has caused many to believe that God truly did die for our sins in a human body on a cross, then rose up from the dead.

What I especially like is the crowds' reactions to his teachings.  He was a bit of a ""stand-up,"" seasoning his picturesque messages with humor!

Bravo!  Well-done!  Encore!"
1480,6486576,5,Epic production and pure fact from scripture!
1481,6486576,5,I have the original VHS tape from the '80s.  The Story speaks for itself.  The Presentation remains the Best Evangelical Tool available.
1482,6486576,5,thank you
1483,6486576,5,Great movie about the Lord Jesus Christ. I think we will see the real thing here real soon. Time is short.
1484,6486576,5,"This is an excellent, Biblically accurate video.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase.  I don't know how long I'll be hanging on to this one, because passing it along is what it was made for -- but I'll enjoy it while I have it!"
1485,6486576,5,HERMOSA HISTORIA DE JESUS !!
1486,6486576,5,we saw very good movie thank alot
1487,6486576,5,wonderful
1488,6486576,5,"I love this movie, it's a timeless classic for the entire family to enjoy. This is a very descriptive account of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."
1489,6486576,5,"they did a very good job taking the book of Luke, studying it.  and doing tons of research how the lived in the time of Jesus.  A very good cast for the movie."
1490,6486576,5,Recoomen
1491,6486576,5,"This a very good movie, so I ordered for a friend of mine. I definitely recommend it"
1492,6486576,5,"This is one of my favorite movies about Jesus. The script comes straight from the Bible without any manipulation from so called artistic license so prevalent in Biblical movies these days. Jesus' message is pure and perfect as it is. The Bible does not need a script revision!

The actor who plays Jesus is wonderfully believeable. He manages to portray Jesus as a real individual, a combination  of divine love and purpose but filled with joy and sorrow and compassion. I highly recommend this account of Jesus' time on earth."
1493,6486576,5,My favorite Movie
1494,6486576,5,"Great, I love this movie, me and my family!"
1495,6486576,5,"In most of the Jesus movies . . . Jesus seems almost untouchable or too sacred to be approached. This was so refreshing as Jesus was portrayed as the most approachable I've ever seen. Someone who was ""real"" who ""laughed"" ""cried"", got ""angry"", set an example without making others feel inferior. Doing unto others as He would have them do unto Him. I recommend this highly for family, groups, sleep overs for kids, and home groups for adults. And for those times when you need to eat ice cream/chocolate and be encouraged. (that's a ""she"" thing) LOL."
1496,6486576,5,Useful for children ministries.
1497,6486576,4,"This film is a classic true story about the Son of God taken entirely from the Gospel of Luke. I also recommend a video called the Gospel of John, get the 3 hour version it is totally worth it! The Gospel of John is a 5 star film."
1498,6486576,3,"I was initially moved by this film when I saw it on its theatrical release. It is a simplistic, realistic retelling of the Gospel of Luke. Now more than thirty years later, it doesn't resonate as well. More recent productions of the same storyline are more emotional, awestruck and have better photography and musical scores, but this version of Jesus is a pure bread and butter version especially suited for those not yet familiar with the teachings of Jesus and need an initiation presented in a plain and simple way. A few years ago, this same evangelical production company created a wrap-around version of the film centered on the conversion of Mary Magdaline which, oddly enough, seemed more affecting than the original."
1499,6486576,5,"This is an excellent Jesus film for showing in sunday school, for introduction to Christianity for anyone interested, evengelism, etc because this is based exactly on Book of Luke."
1500,6486576,5,I watched this movie years ago. I was not aware I could find it on amazon. I am very happy I did!. gave my son a copy as well
1501,6486576,4,Seemed to be the film that followed most closely the biblical story of Jesus.  The film is a bit dated.
1502,6486576,5,This dvd on Jesus is wonderful and true to the Bible. No wonder it has been translated into so many languages. It presents the viewer with the love of Jesus and our need to follow Him.
1503,6486576,5,"I  love  everything that have to be about God and his holy, holy, holy son Jesus Christ, this movie makes me reflect and make me a renovated person,  God blessed us all!"
1504,6486576,5,This is a pretty good version of the story. I have not heard of it before although it is advertised to be well known.
1505,6486576,5,"There are many films about our Lord and Savior out there, and they usually offer something different.

The 1977 ""Jesus of Nazareth"" offers a harmonious composition of the 4 Gospels as well as educated speculation. You need 6 1/2 hours to watch it. But it is well worth the time.

Mr. Gibson's ""The Passion"" (2004) was interesting if you want to see just to what extent Jesus suffered.  I also give Mel Gibson credit for underlining that the mass is not only a reenactment of the Last Supper, but it also embodies the sorrowful events of Good Friday and the glorious events of Easter Sunday.  (Though it's far from what I would call a child friendly version.)

This is a great version if you don't have 6 1/2 hours to watch the phenomenal ""Jesus of Nazareth,"" or if you don't feel up to the brutal and intense ""The Passion.""

This film is kept at a 2 hour length.  But the tradeoff is that the events in the film are ONLY from the ""Gospel According to Luke.""  That probably won't bother everyone, but I felt obligated to point out that you can't expect the best scenes of all 4 Gospels.

Alright. Onto the subject at hand. The film begins with Mary being visited by the Holy Spirit. Another thing I should point out is that to help keep the film under 2 hours, narration is used to explain the shift from event to event.

I'd rather not go too much into a plot synopsis. If you have read ""Luke,"" you probably already have an idea of what is to follow. I can however say that the film is done with a beautiful style that has dignity and is not overdone. Brian Deacon (Jesus) doesn't play the role with the same intensity that Robert Powell did in ""Jesus of Nazareth."" But Deacon gives the role a gentle dignity. He gives a real feeling of beauty to the lessons. And while he doesn't have the same fierceness during Jesus' frustrations as Robert Powell did, we can feel his frustration when he gets annoyed.

The sorrowful Good Friday scenes are certainly nowhere near as brutal as the ones in ""The Passion."" But we still get the idea of how much Jesus is suffering. And the glorious events of Easter Sunday are beautifully done.

Like I said, if you don't have 6 1/2 hours to watch the phenomenal ""Jesus of Nazareth,"" and you don't feel quite up to the brutality of 'The Passion,"" this 1979 Brian Deacon film is a perfect alternative.

Another thing I should point out is that ""The Passion"" is NOT child friendly. ""Jesus of Nazareth"" is in the middle. It's certainly nowhere near the brutality of ""The Passion."" But 6 1/2 hours may be too much to show some children. One great thing about this film with Brian Deacon is that it is really child friendly. The lessons are there and drawn accurately from ""Luke."" And the suffering of Good Friday is there, but not overdone  as in ""The Passion.""

Another thing that makes this film good for children is that most of the footage is taken from the simply (but also beautifully) written ""Good News Bible.""

I like ""Jesus of Nazareth"" and ""The Passion."" And I can suggest this film as well without reservation."
1506,6486576,5,"It was a moving movie about Jesus. We had this picture on VHS and it had a wrinkle in the tape, so this is a replacement tape."
1507,6486576,5,"I can play the movie to everybody and don't have to worry about explaining everything, just press the button and relax and watch, how wanderful, marvelous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1508,6486576,5,I finally found this on DVD. I had this on VHS then my old VCR broke. I am glad they had this on here.
1509,6486576,5,"Classic, based on the Gospel of Luke. This version depicting the life of Jesus, I believe, is the most spread world wide and has touched the lives of millions."
1510,6486576,5,I owned the VHS version of this movie so I knew what to expect as far as the production being somewhat dated. If you're looking for a word-for-word rendition of the Gospel of Luke look no further.
1511,6486576,5,love this movie and I highly recommend this movie.  I had this on VCR and have been looking for it on DVD.
1512,6486576,2,"It is a good film for someone who has never heard of or studied Jesus, but a tad simple in its presentation of all the material."
1513,6486576,5,"Taken from the book of St Luke, like very much as Jesus is God and all powerful. Watch movie a lot, a peaceful movie in a world of turmoil, strife and sin, must see for Christians and non Christians.  Great movie,  Rob Schwab"
1514,6486576,5,One of the best Christian movies out there. Portrays the gospel of Luke very accurately. Nothing but Jesus and the gospel. The script comes straight out of the Bible.
1515,6486576,5,Saw this as a kid in Hindi and I've never forgotten it.  Having the multiple languages is great.  I've also used it in my church for the kids.
1516,6486576,5,"The depiction of Jesus as a man and as the son of God is the most realistic I have ever seen.  Very wonderful story, directed well, and characters chosen for the parts well thought through. Very enjoyable to watch and heart felt to realize as truth."
1517,6486576,5,"Was awesome I really enjoyed it, would encourage every one to get it, I love the new additions to the movie, the intro and the reviews, just awesome"
1518,6486576,5,"So often, we view Jesus as just that, a product. Rather than let his law define us and how we should live, we take our own limited and broken experience and apply it to Jesus from which we derive expectations of Him. We rail against Him when these expectations are not met, and applaud smugly when they are. What we forget is that Jesus is God, and that He has surpassed anything that we could ever expect. He is greater than our expectations. When I look at my own life, I realize that all the sadness and misery I've experienced has resulted from putting my hopes and expecations in things that are not of God. The Bible tells us that whatever does not come from God is not good, and yet I place my trust in it anyway. In my sin, I desire a quick, selfish satisfaction, and I expect that coming from things I can measure. This much money, or these many relationships, or this much time spent on mindless entertainment. Whatever entertains me for a duration of time, however superficial it may be, I'll devote myself to because it's what I arbitrarily want. But I'm never satisfied completely or without guilt after I seek to please myself and not God. What I forget is that I have a Savior who came to give life and life abundantly. What Jesus has given us goes beyond measure. All we have to do is surrender to Him. Give up our life in idolatry and sin, which only leads to death, and turn to Jesus, the light of the world and source of life abundant. I know why Jesus is Saviour, and in recognition of that, desire him to be Lord of my life. I cannot 'rate' him, because I'm not worthy but hope that he will rate me as one of His own, so that I may one day hear God say to me, ""Well done, my good and faithful servant"".
In Christ,
 Brad Robinson"
1519,6486576,5,"We had an original VCR which we watched over and over.  Finally the tape gave out and we were so happy we could now get ""Jesus"" on DVD.  I ordered 3 DVD's one for our personal use and one for my daughter's classroom and one for her school's library.  God Bless You and keep up your good work.

1520,6486576,5,I found this movie on YouTube and wanted it to use in Sunday School.  I try to collect all of the movies about Jesus and this one was good.
1521,6486576,5,I love anything about the Life Of Jesus ! I would HIGHLY recommend this film to ANYONE and EVERYONE - so they can learn more about The Saviour of our souls !  The Story of Jesus is the BEST IN THE WORLD - because HE made a way that we can come to The Father - be forgiven of our sins (by His Death on The Cross) - be set Free - walk in HIS Power and Grace and Victory - live with HIS Holy Spirit DWELLING in us to do HIS works - bring others into the Kingdom Of God - thereby bringing GLORY to GOD - and in the end spend ETERNAL LIFE one day with HIM and THE FATHER !  Hallelujah and GLORY TO JESUS - GLORY TO GOD !
1522,6486576,5,"The movie was great it's the whole book of Mathew, it's the whole life of Jesus dvd has more episodes than the vhs tape so it was a great buy!"
1523,6486576,5,"It's about Jesus, what is not to like, done well.......still works over time with any person or persons or age groups"
1524,6486576,5,I have seen this film in 5 languages and it is still perfect for our friends who are seeking the Savior.
1525,6486576,3,If you want to learn(jesus' life) across the gospel luke is good recommendation.  The gospel according to Matthew is better production.
1526,6486576,3,"I bought this movie on advice that many Jewish traditions are shown in the depiction of Christ.  This movie is a faithful but not very high tech.  The miracles are usually explained or the viewer is expected to know what happened.  This is a good telling but not in the league of ""The Greatest Story Ever Told""."
1527,6486576,5,Thank you for sending the Jesus film. I saw it on a mission trip in Masaii and Swahili so I wanted to have a copy to watch in English. I am reading through the New Testament this year and hope to watch it soon.
1528,6486576,4,excellent movie that has changed millions of lives all over the world.  I highly recommend this movie if you want to know Jesus.
1529,6486576,4,"The Visual Bible Matthew word for word was excellent as compared, but this complete message is great too.  This film invites a decision concerning Christ."
1530,6486576,5,"Watching this movie will bring the Bible alife to you. There has never been a true Jesus movie that will stick entirely to the scripture (LUke) as this one. If you are looking for true Jesus movie that will not back slide from the Bible I strongly recommends this one. You won't be disapointed. The performances are great! The entire movie was shot in Isreal. Wekipedia says, It's the most watch Jesus movie in the history of Mankind all over the world translated in many languages."
1531,6486576,4,"Didn't know Brian  Deacon. Now I am a fan. My siblings and I grew up agreeing with Jesus of Nazareth as our favorite Jesus movie, esp because Robert Powell was the closest to how we think Jesus could've been like. His scrawny body would be how Jesus might've looked like from the physical mental spiritual exercises he had to go through. Robert Powell's soulful eyes and his acting was good. This movie on the other hand came off as a retro-ish 70's 80's kinda because of the hairstyle and the sound, and the accent was distinctly something else, but this surprisingly turned out to be REALLY good. The Jesus here is more spontaneous in his actions. He laughs. When he speaks, he teaches, it's like effortless. Yet the words are powerful. You could imagine Jesus. There are so many scenes and scripts in this movie that impressed on me. I have heard them before but hearing it the way the apostle had written (forgot which apostle, and I had lent this dvd to a new friend and hadn't gotten in back in a while so I had forgotten. AT the beginning of this movie it will tell you which apostle and now I too am a fan of his, too bad I had forgotten which one he was. :-)  made the story and the words have power again. Those who haven't seen this movie, I recommend it and you would know what I cannot describe. There is even a version for children which I didn't buy so I can't write my opinion about it. I love the scene with the children, and the one wherein the pharisees tried to trick him. And that before entering Jerusalem, many more. You have seen and heard them before but it's just different, powerful in its simple delivery. The scene where he was teaching in the forest and one follower asked something; oh, and that of the woman who had put coins for tithes, moving, many others in this movie. I have so many favorite scenes and verses from this film.

Oh, and btw, this can be played in different languages. That new friend i had mentioned is  married to a Japanese who is not Christian and the couple was able to watch this together and the friend said he liked it and his wife did, too.

Seller pay me for my endorsement! :-))"
1532,6486576,5,"I always loved this movie of Jesus, that way I decided to buy it, and it was what I was expecting because I have seen this movie before."
1533,6486576,4,I did enjoy the movie. It seemed to follow scripture very well. I shared the movie with my parents as I had it already under a different jacket. I am sure anyone will like the movie and it is good for all family members.
1534,6486576,5,"The dvd was in perfect condition.  Played great, no skips, slow downs or stopages.  It was just what I needed for a lesson in our Mens group Bible study."
1535,6486576,3,"...Maybe it's because technology has come so far in the last decade, (Yes, that must be it) but I was very disappointed in this poor production.
 I had high expectations, based on the reviews I read.

I applaud all those who were involved in this project for their desire and efforts to spread the Truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, for NOTHING is more crucial to our world today than God's True Agape Love.  But, in my opinion, Almighty God deserves a higher effort.

The message itself is highly accurate, and THAT is the most important thing. As a teaching tool, this film can be very useful. But the acting, the tone, the pace & delivery of the dialogue, and the overall production is quite dry and slow. If you're looking to be ""entertained"", this is not the production for you.

PRAISE THE LORD OF GLORY!!!"
1536,6486576,4,"Jesus is a 1979 film starring Brian Deacon in the role of Jesus. This version is based on the Gospel according to Luke. It is very accurate and if one reads the gospel along whilst watching the film one will see that they have done a great job. As with any film there are however problems. For instance, the music sounds on the cheap and sometimes the editing feels less then professionally done. Brian Deacon is very good in the role as Jesus and he plays the role with conviction. The ending is not that great and they could have left it out. Even so it was a quite good film. Recommended. 4/5."
1537,6486576,5,"For this movie being so old, it is very good. Gets right to the point of who Jesus is. Great for young kids."
1538,6486576,5,I highly recommend this movie on dvd for a Christian witnessing tool and a reminder over the holidays particuliarly Easter and Christmas what they are trully about. And to Christians as a refresher now and again of who Christ is and should be in our lives.  Taken from the Gospel of Luke and easy to follow with a bible in hand.
1539,6486576,5,"This set is just awesome. I gave each one of my children their own sets for their families.  I love this set, especially the kids disc and my grandchildren love it as well. Just to see kids portraying back in Jesus Day is a sight to behold.  I recommend and have given this set to some of the people I know.  By giving them this set is my way of spreading God's word.

Be Bless."
1540,6486576,5,"Excellent film, Biblically accurate, taken from the book of Luke, set in Israel. Would recomend this film for all ages and families."
1541,6486576,5,"The best thing about this film is the fact that it adheres to the Bible as it is written.  Hollywood took no liberties or artistic license.  You hear the Scripture exactly as it is written in the book of Luke.  The places where it was filmed are real, and the costumes and actors look authentic.
It is probably the only Bible film that doesn't take from or add to the Word of God.  Other films, like Jesus Of Nazereth; the Ten Commandments; The Nativity; the Passion of the Christ; etc.  have added to or left things out for the purpose of pushing their own agendas.  There is a strict warning in Scripture itself.

Revelation 22:19  New International Version 1984 (NIV1984)
19 And if anyone takes words away from this book of prophecy, God will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book."
1542,6486576,3,"Nice teaching tool. The message is clear even though production values are low. It looks and sounds like an episode of Little House on the Prairie. Definitely not a major motion picture or epic. But it does well at telling the story of Jesus: the son of man who was born to be the son of God, nothing more and nothing less."
1543,6486576,4,It is very difficult to accurately reflect the vastness and moreover the authority of Jesus Christ in a single movie. But it is a start and could surely be used as the beginning of a much more intense study of the son of God and how he wants to relate to us and how he wants us to care for each other.
1544,6486576,5,"I had heard about 'The Jesus Film' for a long time, but for some reason, I had not watched it until now.  I am very glad that I saw it.

This is a superb depiction of the life, words, and deeds of Jesus Christ.  Taken from the book of Luke, it is a beautiful and highly accurate portrait of the most important person in the history of the world, the Savior of the World - Jesus of Nazareth.

This is not one to rent.  This is one that is well worth buying, sharing with others, and watching again."
1545,6486576,3,"I've seen this before, and recently bought it.  I was intrigued because I own ""The gospel of John"" which is by far the best Jesus movie I have ever seen and is word for word, straight from the book of John.  Enjoying how a movie was made from the unadulterated word of God, I got ""Jesus"" which claims to be from the book of Luke. I tried to follow along and realized exactly how much is left out.  Quite a bit is left out and parts that could be narrated are visually shown instead.  That was why I liked ""The Gospel of John""  everything that was written was either spoken by the actors or the narrator in the movie.  Nothing was added and nothing was taken away.  Unfortunately, I was hoping for the same thing in this movie and was slightly disappointed.  It wasn't a raping of scriptures as some movies are and just want to recreate Jesus in their own fictional ideal, but it wasn't perfect either.  You could definitely learn from and enjoy the movie, but I highly recommend ""The Gospel of John"" more."
1546,6486576,5,Archaeological and anthropological efforts successfully get a lot of the life of the first century  right; slight cultural compromises aren't too detracting (what is it about Jesus' styled hair?!) Also faithful to KJV translation of Luke without added commentary or action. Great service -- arrived in 3 days.
1547,6486576,5,I first purchased  this movie on VHS in 1979.  Now I have the DVD.  Thanks  Amazon.  The DVD color  and clarity are both great.  The movie is  true to the Word as it is written in the King James Bible.  Plain and simple Jesus is an inspirational movie.  The title speaks for itself.
1548,6486576,5,I am very happy with my product! I will be buying more from them and will recommend them to my friends!!!!
1549,6486576,5,This is the story of Jesus's life as told from Luke. I love all the languages you can choose from to view this movie in. Wonderful product and story for any age.
1550,6486576,5,"We bought the dvd to replace a vhs that had wore out.  An extremely well done movie on the life of Jesus Christ.  All the words are taken from the book of Luke, a new testament book of the Bible.  We watch it several times a year, especially around Easter and Christmas.  My fifteen year old said it is still as moving as the first time she watched it."
1551,6486576,5,"This is probably the most underrated movie on the Lord Jesus ever made. Anyone who wants an accurate biblical movie on Him, that is also entertaining, should have this edition. The price was great too!"
1552,6486576,5,"This is absolutely one of the very best movies ever made about the life of Christ.  Since it is almost word for word from the Bible, except for a few conversational interactions, such as greetings, etc., you can be sure it is true to God's word.  One thing I love about it is that it shows Him as a strong man (He WAS a carpenter, after all.) rather than a milk toast as He is usually depicted.  The only thing I did not like was that since they wanted to stay true to the book of John, they didn't put a crown of thorns on his head, because although Matthew, Mark, and Luke all do describe the crown, John does not.  Yet, you can't fault their resolve to be absolutely true to that account.  If you saw Mel Gibson's The Passion of Christ movie, and felt the crucifiction scenes were a little too much for younger children, then this is the best choice out of all other movies made."
1553,6486576,5,"Bought this video to use in church. It's an excellent and clear film of the life of Christ. Not all events are shown (ie it's not a composite of the four gospels of the Bible - only Luke). Starting to look a little dated, but it really doesn't matter. Millions have seen this film in dozen's of languages and many have decided to follow Christ because of it. highly recommended."
1554,6486576,3,"This was told from the Gospel of Luke. It is a nice story, Slightly dated. If I saw this used for a few dollars, I might pick it up."
1555,6486576,5,"Beautiful story about Jesus Christ, the best I've watched. All of the actors look so natural, the music is superb and the text is so clear. Very interesting documentary about Jesus' public life but this is a film of about only 1,5 hours. I remember that the whole TV series was about 8 hours. It would be much better to have the whole series in a box set."
1556,6486576,5,"This is my favorite film on the life of Jesus.  It is based on the Gospel of Luke.  Not every event in the film is in Luke's gospel or vice versa.  But I enjoy this film nonetheless.

It is filmed in the Holy land and most of the actors are like those you see in that land.  The acting is excellent.  I appreciate that the director allows children to play roles in the movie, for Jesus loved children.  Not like today, where people claim that ""they are for the children"" but then vote for politicians who saddle the children with an unbearable debt.  At the end of giving the parable about the good Samaritan, Jesus asks ""who acted as this man's neighbor?"" and a small child answers.  In Luke's gospel, a grown man answers, however the slight changing of events do not bother me since the message remains the same.

In the film you will often hear background voices.  For example there is the occasion where a poor old lady deposits two small copper coins into the Temple treasury, since all she had were those two coins.  As she is doing this, you can hear people in the background commenting, in cockneyed accents, ""only a mite?"" ""can't she give more?"" ""it's very little.""  These sayings are not documented in the gospel but again, do not detract from the message; rather they emphasize our own sinful nature and our need to repent."
1557,6486576,5,Please tell 'em that Amazon is going to lose me as a reviewer if they make it complicated!  Five stars means that I got the order promptly and in good condition!  I don't know how to communicate with them.
1558,6486576,5,"This film is not Hollywood's version - it is a historically researched and biblically based film on 3 and a half years of Jesus life and ministry as found in the book of Luke.  This DVD has been updated to include 8 language tracks including Spanish, French, Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, English, Korean, Japanese, and Portugese.  It is also updated to include Digital Dolby Surround Sound!  The DVD also includes the making of the Jesus Film in a ""Behind the Scenes"" documentary.  This is the DVD you want to watch if you want an accurate portrayal of the life of Jesus."
1559,6486576,5,"The Jesus Film is truly a phenomenon and great tool for reaching many people to understand the Jesus that is described in the Gospel of Luke.  The producers of this movie did painstaking research for many years, and they sought to be accurate in the little details, not only of the clothing and village life, but the ways the people talked and recited the prayers.  The filmmakers sought and succeeded in making a very accurate depiction of the life of Christ as taught in the Holy Bible.

The Jesus Film has been seen by over 4.7 billion people in 236 nations and thousands of people have accepted Christ as their personal Savior through this remarkable movie.  More people have watched this movie than any other movie in history. It is based on the Gospel of Luke and sticks very closely to the biblical text. (There is very little outside interpretation or extraneous material.)  This is its most valuable asset.  Watching this movie is like taking a picturesque tour of the Gospel of Luke.

Brian Deacon is a charismatic and believable Jesus. He speaks with authority.  He also displays different emotions -- he smiles and treats children with great affection; he is stern toward the religious leaders and hypocrites.  He also displays sadness and grief.  Brian Deacon also looks like a man in his 30's, which Jesus was when He began His earthly ministry after being a carpenter for so many years.

Many of the familiar scenes are depicted in this movie (The Birth, the Baptism, the Teachings, Healings, Trials, Suffering, Death and Resurrection).  There are certain scenes in the Gospel of Luke which are  depicted in this movie which don't appear in other Jesus films except the Gospel of Matthew - Visual Bible (e.g. The Transfiguration,  The healing of the Gadarene demoniac;  Jesus' praying in Gethsemane and sweating drops of blood, then being strengthened by the angel).

What is so useful about this movie is that it is dubbed very precisely in so many languages.  This particular DVD features the spoken languages of English, Arabic, French, Japanese, Korean, Portugese, Mandarin (Chinese), and Spanish.  The subtitles are done in English, Spanish, French, Portugese, and Arabic.  If you look at the wonderful behind-the-scenes documentary of how the movie was dubbed, you'll see that they selected trained experts to read the text in the native language and they timed it to the milli-second to make it precisely right.  So, when Jesus speaks, it looks and sounds as if He is speaking the native language.

There are wonderful Special Features in this DVD:

Besides Direct Scene Access, there is a documentary of Knowing Jesus Personally, where the gospel message is presented and the teachings of Jesus are explained.  There is the Behind-the-Scenes look at how the film was made.  There is also a Tribute to Jesus from people like George Bush, Larry King, David Copperfield, Billy Graham, Mother Theresa, and others.

There is also a bonus DVD of the story of Jesus for Children.

Even though the acting may not be up to par as Hollywood, they do a good enough job.  The biggest plus of this movie is how faithful it is to the biblical text. An added plus at the end of the film is a complete and clear presentation of the Gospel message.

I bought several copies of this DVD for my friends and church members and they have found it very useful.  I enjoy watching this movie over and over again.  I highly recommend this film, along with ""The Gospel of John."""
1560,6486576,5,"Though not the most current film, it's the closest to the biblical account of what transpired."
1561,6486576,5,"Of course, the story of Christ is as ageless as God Himself.  This film was so well put together and released back in 1979, that it needs no update.  The movie was filmed mostly on-location for authenticity.

This DVD fits appropriately in any Christian's collection, and serves well in ministry projects as well."
1562,6486576,5,"This is a good movie to share with your friends and family.  My favorite is still the Gospel of John.  With that said, this is still a good movie to get."
1563,6486576,5,"If there is any Jesus movie that touches the hearts of men, this one does.  I bought three of these and play them so much, I want to make sure I have it a long time. The fact that the words are taken entirely from the Bible, and portraying the life of Jesus simply and accurately without added ""Hollywood"" glamor, tinsel and big-name movie stars distracting the meaningful intentions of this story: that of our Lord and Savior here in the flesh over 2,000 years ago."
1564,6486576,5,"Awesome movie about our LORD JESUS CHRIST.

I also recommend, The Gospel of John, this too is an awesome movie, a must for your Christian movie collection.

I thank the Almighty GOD for JESUS in our life's."
1565,6486576,5,"This is a great movie, I love it because I was saved about a year after recieving this movie as a gift, it helped open my eyes so that I left the LDS church, leaving the competetive race to earn my way to heaven, to find the loving father that I always wanted, and never want to leave even if I could become a ""god"" I would chose to stay with the king that died for me."
1566,6486576,5,"I like this film because it is a sound scriptural based movie about the Lord Jesus.( I love all Jesus films!)  Once again the story is narrated well and the acting is a good enough to keep the viewer's attention.  This film shown in several languages actually is an outstanding learning tool for better understanding the message and mission of Jesus - and to understand His Truth can surely shape the course of your life!

amen!"
1567,6486576,5,"""Jesus, His Life, Mystery and Message"" is a marvelous film on the life and times of Jesus, and though in its 10 chapters it skips around a bit, and there is an occasional slip in the script, those familiar with Scripture will appreciate this ambitious project, and the content that is biblically based, as well as the visual presentation. An Italian production by the Paulines, with writer/director Alberto Castellani and cinematographer/director Giancarlo Cappellano, it takes us through the significant sites in the Holy Land, and also blends in exquisite works of art, from masters like Duccio and his contemporaries, and iconic treasures of Greek and Russian origin.

It delves into the archeological evidence of the Bible, including the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the many miracles of Jesus, His life as an observant Jew, historical perspectives, and much more. The mixture of music used is also good, and ranges from dramatic melodies to beautiful cantorial singing. This is a 2-sided DVD, with 5 chapters on each side, and is playable in either English or Spanish, and the Spanish narration overall has a better audio quality. It must be noted that the film does not have a Hollywood multi-million $ look, as the color reproduction in the art work is a little off at times, and it is slightly grainy, but not bothersome at all, as the content overrides its flaws. Informative, wonderfully photographed, and occasionally quite moving, this is an excellent addition to anyone's library of Christian films, and will be of interest to those of any faith who wish to learn more about Jesus, and the historical roots of Christianity. I give it 5 stars for making the most of a low budget production. Total running time is 160 minutes."
1568,6486576,5,"I they were selling this movie at my church when a special guest came one Sunday. I bought this movie and I have to agree that this is the best movie I have ever seen on the life, death and resurrection of my Lord Jesus Christ. I haven't seen ""the Passion"" yet, I plan to very soon and I have high hopes for the film, but this one is equally as good.

Very well done film that was done with great care, excellent movie I recommmend everyone see"
1569,6486576,5,"Taking five years to research and produce, this 1979 film is meticulous in its recreation of the time of Jesus. It uses over 200 locations in the Holy Land, many actors from the region, and is based on portions of the Gospel of Luke.
This is the film used by over 1,500 denominations and missions to evangelize, and it has been translated into 877 languages and shown to over five billion people in 228 countries, and is an excellent ""tool"" for this purpose, because it is simple and at the same time very powerful and moving.

British actor Brian Deacon is a wonderful Jesus, with a soft but manly voice and perfect enunciation, making the words of Jesus come to life in a very special way.
Others of note are Niko Nitai as Simon Peter, Rivka Neuman as Mary, Talia Shapira as Mary Magdalene, and the part of John the Baptist (played by Eli Cohen) is short, but physically the closest I have seen on film to what I imagine the real John looked like.
Richard Kiley narrates as Luke, and also listed as narrator is Alexander Scourby.
Directed by John Kirsh and Peter Sykes, it has some terrific passages; one of my favorites is the storm at sea (Luke 8:22-25), which is very effective, and the cinematography by Mike Reed, and the locations, a pleasure to watch.

The film ends with an invitation to salvation, and with it the promise of ""a full, abundant life, filled with purpose and meaning"", and with a quote from Revelation 3:20: ""Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him"".
Total running time is 83 minutes."
1570,6486576,5,"To claim that Jesus Christ did not even exist is mere ignorance. Such preposterous claims belie a desire for some illusion of moral or intellectual superiority. The argument is nothing but a straw man easily knocked down. There is plenty of historical and archaeological evidence to support the FACT that Jesus Christ did in fact exist. The Jesus movie is a good introduction to his life and teachings but by no means comprehensive (for that you need the Bible).
If you're sincere in your search for the Truth, I highly recommend reading Josh McDowell's book, More Than a Carpenter, as an easy first read. Available at Amazon.com, of course.
It's reasonable to question Jesus' deity if you've only heard the name and never seriously investigated His life. Those who have, including the hard-nosed skeptics who set out to debunk this thing called Christianity, often become Christians themselves. Those who don't generally do so out of mere pride -- an unwillingness to sacrifice their old, comfortable beliefs that allow them to live an ungodly lifestyle. But you reject Jesus at your own peril. It's the very height of folly.
As for my opinion of the Jesus the movie? Why not judge for yourself! You can watch the entire movie streamed online at jesusfilm.org in any of 62 languages (of the 858 it's been translated into)! Then you can decide whether or not to purchase the DVD.
I do recommend this film. I also recommend, highly, 2003's The Gospel of John. It is extremely faithful to the New Testament book of John and really brings life and a better understanding to the life, times, and teachings of Jesus Christ, God in the flesh.
I wish you well and pray that God may draw you to Him (that you may be receptive to His call). Perhaps I'll see you in heaven someday. If you have honest seeking questions, you're welcome to e-mail me at robvh at wellness5.com."
1571,6486576,3,All I wanted was a dvd of this movie the way I saw it on cable tv. But NOOOOOOOOO! They had to ruin the movie by tagging a 5 minute preachy ask Jesus into your life message. And omitted some written scripture that scrolled the screen at the end of the film with an astronomy back drop.
1572,6486576,5,"Filmed entirely on location in Israel with a largely Jewish cast, the film achieves authenticity that will be difficult for future filmmakers to duplicate. 25 years from now ""Jesus"" will still be a standard by which other films about the carpenter turned rabbi must be judged.
While films like ""The Passion of the Christ"" present more emotion and Hollywood glitz, ""Jesus"" is painstaking in its accuracy. The complete life story is presented based on the biography compiled 2,000 years ago by a doctor named Luke. The film is a plain and simple docudrama that many families make a tradition of viewing every Christmas and Easter. The fact that the film is available in the local language of over 90% of the earth's population says a lot about the film's lasting appeal and prominent place in cinematic history."
1573,6486576,5,"It is impossible to overestimate the important of this 1979 film, for it has made an impact in even the most primitive regions of the earth, places where men and women are only now hearing about Jesus for the first time.  This definitive, rigorously scriptural movie version of the life of Jesus Christ has been seen by over five billion people around the globe, reaching 236 different nations in over 800 languages.  It has helped win innumerable souls to Christ all over the world, and even now, under the aegis of Campus Crusade For Christ, local churches and individuals are coming together in an effort to send a free copy of the movie to every home in the United States.  The movie was a dream over three decades in the making, with five years of pre-production work preceding the seven-month filming that took place in 1978 at a multitude of sites in Israel.  Intense efforts, involving the collaboration of numerous scholars from the whole gamut of Christian churches, went into making Jesus as accurate as it could possibly be - from vintage pottery to historically accurate costuming to sufficient cinders residing behind burning torches, every effort was made to take the audience back to Jesus' time.  It is a non-denominational Christian film; while some churches might quibble about an omission here or a suggestion there, this movie is the story of Jesus and not the story of any particular kind of Christian religion.
The movie is based solely on the Gospel of Luke, and the dialogue you hear is taken straight out of the Bible.  Jesus says nothing in this film that He does not say in Luke's account of his life.  Naturally, every facet of Jesus' life could not be covered here, but the movie does a superb job of showing us who Jesus was and how He lived, taught, suffered, and died for the sins of all humanity.  Brian Deacon does a superb job playing Jesus, and Niko Nitai truly shines in his portrayal of Simon Peter.  At times, the film does seem to jump from one scene to another rather quickly, but this goes back to the authenticity upon which the film was founded.  In a sense, Jesus' ministry was spent walking toward Jerusalem and His death on the cross, so we see Jesus and his disciples walking almost continuously; furthermore, Jesus' teachings, as recorded in Luke's Gospel, are a collection of parables and religious instruction originating from many different events in the life of the Savior.  Jesus took His message to the people instead of letting the people come to Him.
The suffering of Jesus is handled quite well here, clearly portraying the horrific nature of death by crucifixion without making it disturbing enough to scare young children.  You do see the scourging of Jesus and the driving of the nails into his wrists and feet, but the director seemed to set just the right tone for the scenes.  It all makes for a powerful film that has won innumerable souls across the world; to tell someone of Jesus is one thing, but to show that person in such a captivating format as film exactly who Jesus was and how He suffered and died for the sins of humanity makes for a powerful missionary tool.  Even non-Christians will be impressed by the commitment, scrupulous attention to detail, and cinematic mastery that went into the making of this film."
1574,6486576,5,"This movie has been around since 1979, but still is the best movie made on the life of Christ.  It has been translated to more languages than any other movie in history and has changed thousands of lifes through the powerfull message it delivers. I recommed it to everyone, any age, any background. Three thumbs up!"
1575,6486576,3,"With the huge success of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jesus-of-Nazareth/dp/B0000633QW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jesus of Nazareth</a>&nbsp;(1977), the Inspirational Film Distributors Inc. presented A Genesis Project Production, ""Jesus"" (1979).  From the very beginning they tell you this film is a documentary taken entirely from the Gospel of Luke, Chapters 3-24.  This is the film that has been translated into so many languages and still is.  The film is very fast-paced. So fast that much of the storytelling is not told.  They leave out so many years and do not fully explain or dramatize very important details.  Filmed in Israel.  This film does include Jesus was ""alive"" (arisen) from the tomb, spoke to his diciples and then in 40 days ascended into the clouds (from Earth to Heaven).  I am not condemning this film version because I know this film has helped so many people believe in God and Jesus in many countries.  But for a really in depth, detailed and very emotional account of the life of Jesus, I highly recommend,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jesus-of-Nazareth/dp/B0000633QW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jesus of Nazareth</a>&nbsp;(1977)."
1576,6486576,2,"Slavishly faithful to the Gospel of Luke, this by-the-numbers retelling of Jesus's life never develops dramatic momentum.  As cinema, it's just plain dull; the photography is washed-out (as it was even when the film was new), the zoom lens is overused, and the special effects, minimal as they are, get really cheesy.  Everything is exposition, and it's not terribly competent exposition at that.
Some continuity gaffes create unintentional hilarity.  For example, when Jesus dips his head in the water for a total-immersion baptism, his hair never seems to get wet.  (This is a miracle we haven't read about, folks.)
Extras are fun, including a short documentary about the Jesus Film Project, which carts this particular film all around the world as an evangelical tool.  Especially surreal is an hour-long compendium of pious testimonials from such luminaries as George Bush XLI and David Copperfield (huh?).
The soft but adequate full-frame transfer on this DVD doesn't leave out any significant information -- I suspect the film was shot open matte.  But many of the compositions are so inept that you'll swear they were cropped at the sides anyway.
Catholics beware: This film presents a very Protestant-American Jesus, with its emphasis on a ""personal relationship with God"" and other faith concepts that Mother Church could find potentially heretical.  That's no surprise, though, considering that the film was financed by the leader of Campus Crusade for Christ."
1577,6486576,4,"Before I begin my review, I must state something: Having Been translated into over 700 languages, this film has been seen by more than 4 Billion people since its release in 1979 (over 60 Million who saw it have dedicated their lives to the blessed Savior).
THE REVIEW
This is a really good film. It has the power to truly change lives. Brian Deacon shines as Jesus. The things that detract from the film are mediocre acting by most of the supporting cast and some choppy editing. Other than this, a truly mesmerizing movie experience. But the best film version of the Gospels is the 2000 Miniseries version starring Jeremy Sisto (I also here that Mel Gibson's film ""The Passion"" is really good, but I won't decide until I see it this Easter).
Note: This is the 120 Minute Version. I own (and prefer) the 83 Minute Version of the film. Grade: B+"
1578,6486576,5,"This is an evangilistic movie shown around the world (the DVD has a choice of about 8 languages) of the highlights of the ministry of Jesus, according to the gospel of Luke.  It is a very well produced and acted documentary, bringing dramatic visual imagery to biblical scripture.  Intended to introduce people of all nations to Jesus, is should also appeal to those Christians who appreciate adding another dimension to their biblical experience.  This is a 2 DVD set, with the second DVD geared for children."
1579,6486576,5,I love it!! ...even the portrayal of Jesus who is fully human and fully God!  I'm glad I bought it and I praise God for it!
1580,6486576,5,"This movie is taken directly from the Gospel of Luke. It is the best movie you can buy about Jesus because it is taken directly from the Bible, word for word. Be prepared to be touched by God!"
1581,6486576,3,"Very accurate telling of the Gospel according to Luke.  What concerns me about this movie is the portrayal of Jesus.  Like most movies of the life of Jesus, our Lord and Savior is portrayed in very somber terms, almost inhuman in a way.
In real life, Jesus was one of us.  He was part man, part God.  Without sin, but fully enjoying of his time on this Earth
But the story line was execptionally accurate (unlike most tellings of the Gospel) and if you can deal with a Jesus character who seems removed from his surroundings, then this movie will be a great buy for you."
1582,6486576,5,"This is the best and most true movie of anything Biblical that I have seen. And this too is a great fact that attests to the power of the movie: ""No other film has been seen by more than one billion people, translated into more than 425 languages and shown in more than 225 countries.  It is one of the best movies I have ever seen and wonderfully created and acted. If God wasn't in the center of the making of this movie then I don't know who was!"
1583,6486576,4,"This Jesus film is true to the Gospel of Luke.  That is good and bad.  It sticks very close to the Gospel of Luke and avoids the Hollywood straying which most Jesus films undertake.  However, because it is so closely tied to Luke, there is no crown of thorns on the head of Jesus (which is not mentioned in Luke).  Because I am a stickler for accuracy, I think this is the best Jesus film available, even without the crown of thorns."
1584,6486576,3,"This movie, made by the Genesis Project and was released  in theaters nationwide in the early 80's, is unfornuately, boring.  The directing is of novice caliber and the acting very forgetful.  Based on the Gospel of Luke, it fails to give an emotional impact.  I know they wanted to make a great film, but instead, they made an uninspiring account of the life of Christ.
This movie has been hailed by so many layity and pastors as a great witnessing tool.  If this is true, then the movie accomplished something good, however, I find it hard to believe anyone can set through it without falling asleep.  Read the Gospel of Luke instead.
Watch Jesus of Nazareth if you must watch a gospel movie.  This movie, however, is better than King of Kings and is on equal footing as The Greatest Story Ever Told in enterianment value."
1585,6486576,4,"The stories of Jesus' conception and birth are recorded in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. This movie is based on Luke's account. The story begins with a prologue to summarize Jesus' life as a child and to bring the story into focus. John Heyman researched this film for five years and then filmed it in over 200 locations in the Holy Land.

Over one billion people have viewed this work and it has been translated into more than 425 languages and shown in more than 225 countries. The Epic story of the most controversial life in human history could barely be covered in one movie, so this is more of an overview of Jesus' life.

In 83 minutes, this story will make you want to know more about a man who walked the earth, knowing he would die to give man the ultimate gift - Eternal Life. Throughout the movie, Jesus speaks in parables to teach his followers truth. He calls his disciples and empowers them to convey God's messages to a wider audience.

Jesus' Miracles in this movie included the Feeding of the 5,000, Calming the Storm, Raising Jairus' Daughter, and giving site to the blind. The Last Supper is portrayed and then the Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus starts to make this movie more dramatic. This movie very briefly touches on all the trials and then draws you into the emotional aspects of Jesus' Crucifixion. When he triumphs over death and is raised from the dead he appears in bodily form to show that he is indeed alive.

The story ends with Jesus ascending into the clouds [....]

I recommend this movie to all who want to know how to leave this world alive. This movie left me with a feeling of love for Jesus Christ, who gave his life for us so we can spend an eternity in heaven with our Creator, God.

~The Rebecca Review"
1586,6486576,5,This is the most biblically accurate film of the Gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  Check it out!
1587,6486576,2,"While it is mostly Biblically accurate, nevertheless this is a very lackluster re-telling, being obviously low-budget. The most dramatic and emotional scene for me was when Mary Magdalene's tears fell on Jesus's feet and she wiped them with her hair. The scourging scene lacked any impact, probably not to horrify the audience. According to evidence from the Holy Shroud of Turin and the witness of several Catholic mystics, His scourging was absolutely heart-rending in its horror. Of course, this being an obvious Protestant production, they gave short shrift to Jesus's mother, Mary! Maybe that is why they chose Luke, instead of using material from Matthew, Mark or John!!! I guess what I am looking for is a good Catholic rendering. Any good Catholic out there have about $100,000,000 (or possibly less), as I am ready to do it right!!!"
1588,307142477,1,"This horrible mess should have never been made...terrible story, awful music, dreadful animation (I use the term lightly), nasty characters, devoid of any warmth or charm...just awful, awful, awful.  This has nothing to do with Christmas or any other holiday for that matter.  Stick to the charming ""Frosty the Snowman"" and it's sequel, ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"" where Frosty gets a wife.  Shame on Golden Books for including this with the original Frosty. Wish I could rate this a ZERO but I wasn't given that option."
1589,307142477,1,"I hated this special.  Frosty is completely sarcastic and obnoxious, nothing like the friendly folksy Frosty we all grew to love.  Even sadder is that CBS keeps airing this back-to-back with the original Frosty.  There are so many other great Christmas specials which aren't aired on the major networks (Little Drummer Boy, George C. Scott's A Christmas Carol) because of cable and VCRs.  So it's all the more sad that this one receives yearly attention by a major network.  Couldn't they at least air the true sequel - Frosty's Winter Wonderland?  ABC used to run that one, so I don't know who owns the rights nowadays.  But either way, that would make much sense for a second half hour of Frosty rather than this dreadful piece of unwatchable junk."
1590,307142477,1,This is so lame! The songs are terrible! The villan is a ripoff of Mr. Burns from The Simpsons while the kids look like they're on loan from a Charlie Brown show. But the biggest lowpoint is the Politically Correct ranting! Too bad CBS insists on running this back-to-back with the 1969 classic.
1591,307142477,1,"This is with out a doubt is one of the worst Christmas movies I have ever seen!  My daughter liked it because it had a snowman in it, but that's the only reason.  The movie is filled with overdone, unrealistic, trite political issues of the 90's.  It was too complicated for a small child to follow and there was barely even a plot.  Only get this if your child is in love with snowmen and you've exhausted all other viewing avenues.  There was nothing original in this movie that wasn't absurd.  The original Frosty is so wonderfully simple, buy that one instead."
1592,307142477,2,"""Frosty Returns"" is the epitome of why classics from the 60s and 70s need not be remade.  Although Jonathan Winters does a respectable job as narrator, the story suffers from ""politically correct"" environmentalism and de-Christianization of Christmas.  None of it was necessary and detracts the story.
Furthermore, there is no artistic continuity with the original ""Frosty"".  None of the characters are depicted in their original form and the computer-aided animation doesn't really add anything, either.
I was disappointed that this episode was included with the Frosty DVD.  The true and worthy sequel to the original Frosty is ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"".  Watch that instead as it is MUCH better than this one."
1593,307142477,5,"I'm sure all of you know how exciting office discussions can be...Well, the discussion of the today in our office is ""Did Frosty the Snowman have a girlfriend on the movie Frosty Returns?"" And what was her name?
Please help us resolve this discussions! Thanks so much! Please e-mail me if you have the answer at bluebird111@hotmail.com"
1594,307142477,1,"I just watched this sad excuse for a cartoon for the first time after viewing the original classic Frosty the Snowman. All I could think was is this country in trouble. Simply put the movie was worse than anything I could have ever imagined. It is an insult to the original cartoon. This is the result you get when left wing communist atheists attempt to destroy our American culture and traditions. How often do you hear any commercials on television or radio mention Christmas anymore? The term Christmas is practically banned from the public airwaves. I say boycott any business that refuses to use the term Christmas in their advertising. Thank god there are some of us old enough to remember what this country and it's traditions use to be like. It was at one time the greatest country in the world, currently being destroyed by the communist enemy within. I fear for the future of this Country. And in closing I must add, who ever heard of a winter carnival? I can say with confidence that this cartoon caused Jimmy Durante to turn over in his grave. An absolute disgrace."
1595,307142477,4,"I caught this on CBS back to back with the original Rankin Bass version. The original served to remind me why I loved it so much as a kid, and I better appreciated some of the story's depth than I could as a child. Leading into ""Frosty's Return,"" My stomach knotted with dread... not another vile sequel; or worse yet, a bargain-bin knockoff... But I was pleasantly surprised by a weird and surreal spin on the Frosty mythos. From the moment a tiny Jonathan Winters appears in the snow, I had to see what was going to happen next. This version plays on the innocent wittiness of ""old school"" classic specials, but has some nice weird touches, like tiny Jonathan Winters floating on a marshmallow in a cup of hot cocoa. There are some cute ""tip-o'-the-hat"" in-jokes on other animated specials, too, with some clever (not disrespectful) riffs on the Peanuts cartoons, among others. There are some delicious non-sequitors that had me laughing out loud, but it never takes on that awful, dated ""hipness"" that contemporary animated fare falls into (like Disney's ""Hercules"" ... blecch!)

Being a Heathen, I loved that this ""Frosty"" did not beat me over the head with yet another gloss of the Nativity tale. (Nor did the Rankin Bass original, for that matter.) There was a nice environmental message that wasn't overplayed, and even a reference to the ancient, pagan concept of Yule being a step in nature's cycle, with the promise of life's renewal.

Overall, weird and fun!"
1596,307142477,1,"This waste of time was shown on network immidiately following the original.  Bad music, dated cheesy dialogue, and nothing to do with the original story."
1597,307142477,1,"First, the story and songs are weak.  Second, Christmas isn't even mentioned.  The directors have fallen for the left wing anti-Christmas agenda, resulting in the kids school having a ""Winter Carnival"" instead.  Pathetic.  The real Frosty would melt with anger."
1598,307142477,4,"As long as you know BEFORE you buy it that ""Frosty Returns"" is not the sequel to ""Frosty the Snowman"", you can see it without complaint. It is a different story, and has nothing to do with the original Frosty TV Special. First of all it is made by a different studio, with different animators, directors, and voices. The director is Bill Melendez, who directed all of the Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and Peanuts specials, so it looks like a Peanuts cartoon. Made in 1992. The voice acting features Jonathon Winters, and it has John Goodman as Frosty. The songs are original and pretty fun. The plot is centered on the folks in town that want clean streets in winter by getting all the snow removed. The kids and Frosty are in a panic and fight back or else they will lose all their snow fun - and snow men. If you approach this show knowing it is not the sequel and is from the team that made the Peanuts shows, you will be OK.

IF YOU ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN THE REAL SEQUEL: The studio that made the first hour long Frosty special that first aired on CBS television in 1969 is Rankin/Bass Productions, the kings of holiday specials. That show was based on the original song written in 1951 by Steve nelson and Jack Rollins. The studio made a terrific half hour sequel in 1976 for ABC television titled ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"".  That special starts right where the first one left off.  The basic premise of the story is that Frosty gets a wife named Crystal (played by Shelley Winters), and is sabotaged by the jealous Jack Frost. The character design was by Paul Coker Jr., who did the same work for the first special, so the visual continuity works very well and the characters have that classic Rankin/Bass 'look'. He also did the unique lettering for the credits in both specials. The famous voice actor Paul Frees stars as Jack Frost, and the policeman. Frees was a regular in studio productions and had also voiced the policeman, ticket seller, and Santa Claus in the original. Jackie Vernon voiced Frosty just like he did before. The writer for both Rankin/Bass shows was Romeo Muller, and Maury Laws returned as the musical director. Interestingly, while Rankin/Bassis known for the high quality of their original songs, they used Christmas standards in their sequel.  The major change in the sequel from the original is a big one, the narrator, and it can be unsettling if you watch them back to back.  While the first show was narrated and sung by Jimmy Durante, the second time we had the voice talents of Andy Griffith. Nothing against Andy, but it is a big change.

AND ANOTHER SEQUEL: Another sequel of sorts was made by Rankin/Bass with the same production team, it is a theatrical feature length movie released in 1979 titled ""Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July""."
1599,307142493,5,"Santa Claus is coming to town is one of the best christmas movies ever.  I loved it as a child and bought it for my son to experience the magic of the claymation, the songs, and to learn why Santa Claus does the things he  does.  It is good to see something that you can watch over and over again  without getting bored."
1600,307142493,5,"""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"" (Rankin/Bass Productions, 1970) is a true Christmas classic.  A quintessential ""animagic"" or ""clay-mation"" production, it features the talents of Fred Astaire  (who narrates the story as postman Special Delivery Kluger), Mickey Rooney  (Kris Kringle), Keenan Wynn (Winter Warlock), and Paul Frees (Burgermeister  Meisterburger).  Frees is absolutely brilliant as the voice of the  Burgermeister of the village of Sombertown, which presumably is in  Scandinavia.  In brief, the film explains the origins of various aspects of  the legend of Santa Claus through an original story.  People of all ages  will enjoy ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town.""  Children will love  the animation and the story.  The rest of us appreciate that as well as the  hilarious moments when Kris Kringle expresses surprise (watch his eyes  swell to giant coal-black circles!).  For anyone who grew up in the 1970s  or 1980s, this is a gem of the pop culture of our time.  It's highly  recommended for anyone who has enjoyed other Rankin/Bass classics such as  ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" and ""The Little Drummer  Boy."""
1601,307142493,5,"As a child, I couldn't get enough of this classic.  I've always loved the ""stop motion"" Christmas videos, with ""The Little Drummer Boy"" and ""Rudolph"" coming in at 2nd and 3rd place.  Yes,  it's very dated, complete with far-out animated flowers flying around as  ""Miss Jessica"" sings her song--but I loved every minute of it as  a young girl.  And Fred Astaire--my favorite all-around performer.  In a  world of saturated ugliness, I prefer innocence and naivete, which can only  be found in and of one's childhood, even if it's only make-believe.  If any  of you know where I can pick up a copy of this soundtrack, please let me  know."
1602,307142493,5,My daughter liked the Santa Claus movie she now knows who Chris Kringle is according to the movie.
1603,307142493,5,One of the children's classics and still loved by kids today.
1604,307142493,5,I arrived in a timely manner and there were no issues
1605,307142493,4,An oldie but goodie.  This is one of the Christmas classics that I have to watch every year and it's nice to own it so I can watch it when I want to instead of having to depend on national television channel.

1626,307142493,5,"This is a great video and story for kids at Christmas time. It explains and answers all the questions kids ask about Santa such as ""Why does he wear a red suit, come down chimneys, have a beard, reindeer fly, etc."" This was ceated in the 60's but is a classic like Charley Brown Christmas. If you have small kids you need to treat them to this experience."
1627,307142493,5,Love this movie!!
1628,307142493,5,"""Santa Claus is Coming to Town""  is a 1970 Christmas stop motion animated television special produced by Rankin/Bass Productions. The film stars Fred Astaire as the narrator S.D. Kluger, Mickey Rooney as Kris Kringle/Santa Claus, Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock, and Paul Frees in various roles. The film tells the story of how Santa Claus and several Claus-related Christmas traditions came to be. It is based on the hit Christmas song of the same name, which was introduced on radio by Eddie Cantor in 1934, and the story of Saint Nicholas.

This special is a classic.  Some images have now been cut because of various stupid reasons.

This is still a cartoon that everyone will enjoy.  If you have not seen it in years you should.

This film is solid storytelling.  There is never a dull moment.  BUY the DVD.  Its worth seeing the original unedited version."

And sharing them with the younger generation of my family not only brings back memories it creates new one with the grand kids. There are just so many great movies but the classic family ones are my all time favorites with out a doubt. I have shared them with my own kids growing up and now I am sharing them with my grand kids. I remember watching them when I was younger and I am so happy to have them on Amazon so I will not lose them, no figure prints and cleaning them and they can never break. I can watch them anywhere with the kids on my laptop with my Amazon. This is great for the vacation nights when it is time to settle down. I buy all my movies this way now, they take up no room in the house, no finding the wrong movie in the case, there are so may benefits this way.

I opened it up to check it and it wasn't scratched that I could tell but the top part of the clip the disk sit on was broken. So I'm upset at the condition of the case. There were no sitckers on the outside or anything like that. just a plain clear wrapper."

1707,307142493,5,"Excellent children's fare. Unfortunately, they don't make them like this, anymore. Too much emphasis on glitz and special effects, in today's youngsters' videos."
1708,307142493,5,I looked all over for this movie. We loved watching it as a child growing up and have to have the original with Fred Astaire as th commentator. My brother and his wife were thrilled when they got this in the mail from me!

1714,307142493,5,Everything was great...
1715,307142493,5,Perfect condition. Exactly as pictured and described. Very pleased with purchase.
1716,307142493,4,"I was recently sent a set of Christmas specials in exchange for review, most of which I had never seen before.  One of them was the stop motion classic Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town.  Nope, I'd never even heard of it before, but I found it pretty fun.

As the special opens, we run into a mail man (voiced by Fred Astaire) who is delivering letters to Santa.  He decides to tell us all about Santa.

It starts many years ago when a baby was left in the care of the Burgermeister Meisterburger (Paul Frees).  Being the mean guy that he is, Burgermeister throws the baby out.  But he winds up in the care of a family of elves named Kringle who happen to be toy makers.

The baby grows into a man named Kris (Mickey Rooney) who decides to deliver the toys that his family makes to share the joy with kids everywhere.  But when he returns to his home village, he finds that the Burgermeister Meisterburger has outlawed all toys.  As a result of defying the ban, Kris becomes a wanted fugitive.  Can he find a way to bring joy to the kids of the village?  And what about the Winter Warlock (Keenan Wynn) who lives between the Kringles and the village?

To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this special, and I'm not quite sure why.  Maybe my low expectations were why this one surprised me so much.  I actually got quite caught up in the story even though I had most of it figured out early.  The characters were so great, too, from Kris to his adopted family and his love interest Jessica (Robie Lester) on the good side to the villain you love to hate, Burgermeister Meisterburger.

I'm not a big fan of stop motion animation.  It looks too jerky to me most of the time.  That was certainly the case here, but I actually found it charming.  Maybe I'm softening in my old age.

One drawback to this short is the music.  Outside of the title song (which Fred Astaire sings so well), all the songs were unfamiliar to me.  Frankly, they didn't add much.  In fact, I found myself wanting to fast forward through them to get back to the story.

Not helping at all was how dated the musical segments were.  This special was released in 1970, and it shows.  I got a definite flower power vibe off the animation during the songs.  There were a couple of other times I felt a bit of that crept into the story.  You might also describe it as psychedelic.  My roommate found this aspect even more annoying than I did; I was mostly able to ignore it and get lost in the story again when it was over.

Kids, the target audience, won't notice how dated this is.  In fact, they'll find the 50 minutes over all too quickly.  Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town, and he's doing it with plenty of charm to entertain for years to come."
1717,307142493,4,good cartoon  about christmas
1718,307142493,5,a must have classic!
1719,307142493,5,One of my favorite Christmas movies.
1720,307142493,5,"Rating is for:  Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town, the original TV special from Rankin and Bass.  It is the Best!  I love it.  However, if you like the other similar shows, then BUY it in a combo pack to save a lot of money!  Do not buy just one at a time!"
1721,307142493,5,Fun dvd
1722,307142493,5,I love these old Christmas puppet movies! I will definitely have my kids watching these!
1723,307142493,5,A classic. Absolutely love it
1724,307142493,5,"Gotta live the classics, I used to watched this movie when I was a young boy so now it's my son's turn and he loved it."
1725,307142493,3,santa'd out
1726,307142493,5,Excellent trans
1727,307142493,1,this plays both English and Spanish at the same time.  Was hoping to share a memory with my grandson.  Instead I got something we are unable to watch.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' was originally a 1970 stop motion television special, made by Rankin-Bass. The film stars actor Fred Astaire as the narrator S.D. Kluger, Mickey Rooney as Kris Kringle/Santa Claus, Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock, and Paul Frees in various roles. The film tells the story of how Santa Claus and several Claus-related Christmas traditions came to be. It is based on the hit Christmas song of the same name, which was introduced on radio by Eddie Cantor in 1934, and the story of Saint Nicholas.

The special was created using stop motion animation called ""Animagic,"" in which all the characters are made out of wood and plastic and animated via stop-motion photography. The special was originally telecast December 14, 1970 by ABC and continues to air every year on sibling channel ABC Family, though both channels have at times edited the special to make room for commercials (ABC has cut two key songs, as well as two other songs in half; ABC Family has cut several scenes that might be traumatizing to younger viewers, like Kris climbing, and leaping to escape to prevent children from doing dangerous stunts, Winter Warlock knowing Kris will return, & telling him he'll never escape including the scene where the Burgermeister Meisterburger character torches the seized toys in front of the children of Sombertown).

`Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' was written by Rankin-Bass' go-to writer, Romeo Muller, who explores all aspects of Santa Claus' origins. Narrated by a mailman named Kluger [Fred Astaire], this hour-long special dissects the development of Kris' selflessness, and covers the origins of his beard, hearty laugh, crew of helpers, need to go down the chimney, North Pole residency (he needs to hide from Burgermeister, after all), and pretty much everything in between, providing a hugely creative look at how Santa came to be. On top of being edifying, it's wonderfully entertaining too, full of delightful set-pieces and tender moments of humour.

Whereas today's film makers use 3D computer animation, `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' was executed with stop-motion technology, using models and sets to painstakingly create each frame. It does look dated and rough at times, not to mention the pacing does occasionally drag, but there's something charming about this primitive technique, especially when you consider just how much work went into every second of screen-time. Rankin-Bass movies often featured impressive casts, with the pair securing at least one or two major names for each production. `Santa Claus is Comin' to Town' has two big names, with Mickey Rooney and Fred Astaire both lending their vocal talents to the film. Astaire is a huge asset, guiding us through the story with energy and charm. He has a great singing voice, too, which enlivens the numerous musical set-pieces. Mickey Rooney, meanwhile, submits well-judged work with plenty of heart.

For over four decades now, `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' has been part of annual Christmastime traditions in many households, but mainly in North America, and deservingly so. Romeo Muller's screenplay covers the origins of many holiday traditions - including hiding gifts in stockings and how reindeer fly, while also delivering an uplifting reminder about the real meaning of the season of giving.

Blu-ray Video Quality - This 40th Anniversary Blu-Ray release of `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' features a full 1080p High Definition presentation utilising the 1.33:1 [4:3] Standard Aspect Ratio in which it was originally broadcast. The video presentation looks pretty outstanding for a TV special especially for its age and all of the colours and detail look spot on, easily the best this classic family TV special event has ever been presented. Fans of this TV special should be thrilled with this high definition video presentation and the newcomers to it couldn't possibly find a better way to experience it for the first time. Because it was original made for North America Television, you can see where the adverts were inserted, because you see it fade out, with such a Classic Christmas Special transferred to the Blu-ray format, you think they could of made and effort to edit it in a much more professional way and got hold of the original master tape? I suspect when people viewed this on the DVD format, you would not see the black strings holding up the puppets. But now seeing it in the video resolution of 1080p, you can see very clearly the black string, still after a while you forget seeing this anomaly.

Blu-ray Audio Quality - While it states that the main soundtrack is 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, we are instead treated to a  5.1 channel Dolby Digital soundtrack which isn't too shabby and it's certainly a pleasant surprise to find a multichannel soundtrack of any sort present for such an old special. While as one would expect, the surround element may not provide much in the way of background effects, the special sounds are pretty great here nonetheless and I think overall most will be pretty satisfied with this 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, especially if you have not got the facility of a Home Cinema set-up.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Sadly none has been provided.

Finally, amongst Christmas specials, but particularly amongst those produced by Rankin and Bass, `Santa Claus is Comin' to Town' stands apart. It does so because it is most the most triumphantly well-told of the lot, soon I will describe the most cinematic but here we're talking strictly based on narrative. This may just be Romeo Muller's, the writer Rankin/Bass employed, best work as he makes Santa an even more heroic figure because in this tale we learn of his past, learn to think of him as a person not just an icon, and then also have an antagonist who vilifies him and renders him an outlaw. You have, of course, the talents of Fred Astaire and Mickey Rooney in this tale and the indelible figures of the Winter Warlock and Bergermeister Meisterberger and of course another classic song. It is an absolutely unbeatable combination and one of the best options for the festive season. Highly Recommended!

1754,307142493,1,"I can't believe there are no warnings in reviews that there are major nazi references, terrifying characters and a song about trading a kiss and sitting on santa's lap for a toy!  I've never left a movie review, but I'm hopeful other parents will read this before buying and having to stop it 1/2 way through b/c of how horrifying it is."

1762,307142493,1,"I adore Christmas cartoons and animated shows. I grew up on several. Somehow, I always missed this one growing up. Now I know why, it's extremely slow and boring. I tried watching it twice because my mind wondered. I couldn't stay tuned in the second time either. Oh well."
1763,307142493,5,It is a great movie. It was done by a stop motion company in Japan and they did a great job. I love all the songs.

1768,307142493,5,Kids love this movie!
1769,307142493,5,This is a Christmas movie that has been lost through the years.  This Christmas movie is all about Kris Kringle as a child and how he became Santa Claus.  A wonderful family Christ movie that will bring a different dimension to Santa Claus no matter what your view is for Christmas.  I recommend this movie to all!
1770,307142493,5,It's nice to have some of the classic Christmas shows on hand during the holiday season.  It's one of our favorites!.
1771,307142493,5,When I was a kid  I always enjoyed these movies at time of christmas.....feels like time is back ....without black and white of course...
1772,307142493,5,"Blockbuster shut the only location near us. In order to have these ""classic"" Christmas videos, I chose to use Amazon to purchase the block of movies.  They're great for the grandkids when they visit and we like to get all the classics and watch them while we're putting up Christmas decorations.

Great buy."
1773,307142493,5,"I have this movie on VHS, but I have a DVD player now, and I enjoy sharing these old shows with my granddaughter. She is seven now and has to tell me to be quiet when I sing along! I never get tired of watching, this one is probably my favorite!"
1774,307142493,5,"I bought this book for my 6 yr old to watch.
I think the dvd was in excellent condition as promised.
I would highly recommend this movie. Great Christmas movie for the family to see."
1775,307142493,5,"Great for children & adults of all ages! The claymation and Colorado have been remastered and make
this movie a real treat."
1776,307142493,3,I wanted the hand held DVD. I have no need for a computer video. Please send me the same in video.
1777,307142493,5,"Great purchase.  Kids favorite christmas show.  They enjoy it every year.  Glad we bought it, will watch if for years to come!"
1778,307142493,5,real movie from when i was a kid; my VHS tapes do not play well anymore so this was a great buy
1779,307142493,5,I didn't watch this when I was young the way I did Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Frosty the Snowman except for maybe once but it is a good story and I did get it this year. Its a classic the way those other to and A Charlie Brown Christmas are and you should get it. Merry Christmas.
1780,307142493,5,We love this family movie! It's a holiday classic! My husband and I get a kick out of the 70's style graphics!
1781,307142493,5,"I caught this on ABC-TV tonight as I was flicking the channels.  Every year at this time this airs.  I've seen it countless times over the years.  What else can be said?  It's a classic Christmas tale that's in awesome stop motion animation.  It's funny - this Christmas special with its stop motion animation looks better, more authentic, and more believable than the current computer animated Christmas specials, which look like cartoonish video games.  Anyway, everything about Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town is perfect.  I like the fact that it's sort of a ""prequel"" of sorts, telling the story of how Santa Claus evolved.  The villains in this are so cool and I like the castle, the dungeon, and the overall atmosphere of this Christmas classic.

I highly recommend this Christmas classic over any CGI-animated piece of garbage they make today."
1782,307142493,5,"Wow, this Christmas classic answers all of the little ones' inevitable questions about the origin of Santa, the use of stockings, the use of a chimney, how reindeer fly, etc. In the middle of the main story is a villain, the Warlock, who is transformed from an evil figure to a good one as a result of Santa giving him a toy. Meanwhile, the mayor of Sombertown is determined to uphold his ban on toys, much to the chagrin of Jessica, who is falling in love with Kris Kringle (Santa). As always, the Rankin Bass specials aren't complete without a message; in this case, it's good defeating evil, goodwill and love over hate and persecution. The story is narrated by Fred Astaire, who does a fine job. Santa Claus is Comin' to Town stands as one of the true classics, and belongs in everyone's animated Chrustmas collection."
1783,307142493,5,"I bought this for my 2-1/2 year old granddaughter. She's just beginning to understand Santa, a little, so I thought this movie would help her and she loves movies. I bought this on VHS for my daughter when she was little and also bought her the DVD when it cam out. She's 25, I'm 57 and we both love this movie. Its a Christmas tradition."
1784,307142493,5,"The film has it's own value, but some people underestimate the work by the team that made all of these films, todays CGI animation is great but the quality of such recent CGI hits in theatres wouldn't be there if this team never existed. The blazed the trail the same way Lewis and Clark blazed the trail across the united states and the work in all these films proves it because of how the stand the test of time. Besides, the cast of these films in beyond stellar they are legendary. Not ""THE CHAIRMAN OF TTHE BOARD"" was in one along with other ledgends and if it's good for ""THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD"" it perfect for my household."
1785,307142493,5,"This is a DVD that every family should own. I don't care how old I get, this movie will always be my favorite especially since Fred Astaire is in it...lol."
1786,307142493,5,This is a movie my children loved when they were small.  Now it is time for the grandchildren to love it
1787,307142493,5,I watched this program as a kid and every year for the past few years have purchased it on DVD for my children to enjoy.  So glad to have a digital version.  My youngest sings songs from this episode all year long.
1788,307142493,5,"I loved Topper so much I went out and sought a Topper blow mold to buy. This movie is adorable, and is definitely one of my holiday favorites. I watch it every year."
1789,307142493,5,Brings back a lot of child hood memories from my childhood couldn't wait to get it and watch it with the family
1790,307142493,5,This movie is one of a kind! This is what we watched back on the day and was happy to get it for our lil ones to watch on DVD.
1791,307142493,5,Wonderful movie perfect condition! Brand spankin new. Cheap too couldn't ask for a better price. I don't think there is anywhere you could get movies at such a quality and low price as amazon.
1792,307142493,5,I never get tired of watching this classic!  Brings back memories of being a child.  My kids now enjoy this show.
1793,307142493,5,"There are some things that take you back to your or your children's childhood. This is one of those stories. When my son was little, we would watch the Christmas specials together and this was one we both liked. The actors whose's voices you hear, some are no longer with us, but we can still enjoy their talent."
1794,307142493,5,"What can I say, it's a wonderful Christmas movie for the family.  Arrived on time and perfect condition.  We watch it all the time."
1795,307142493,5,"This was a Christmas gift for my son, he loved it.  Thank you!!  Nothing like a good ole classic to brighten your day!!"
1796,307142493,5,We enjoyed watching even though we ordered late.  Will enjoy for years to come.  Great xmas story.  You/your kids will love it.
1797,307142493,5,"I love this movie.  The copy I had of this movie had other movies which I didn't like.  I wanted this movie by itself.  I went searching on Amazon,  The movie played well for a very reasonable price."
1798,307142493,5,This has always been one of my Christmas favorites. And I have to admit I'm a fan of Fred Astaire. I always loved dancing and puppets. This TV movie will please young and old a like for the Christmas season. The Year without a Santa Claus should be part of your choices as well.
1799,307142493,5,Love the old clay-mation movies. Glad they are still around and for such a low price. Kids today and tomorrow will love these; they truly are timeless.
1800,307142493,5,Great show! I love all the holiday shows and with the DVD I can watch anytime of the year :)
1801,307142493,5,It is always nice to enjoy a movie where I do not have to explain embarrasing actions or words. Fun for the whole family
1802,307142493,5,Super classic Christmas movie. My son was thrilled to have it apart of his collection. Came quickly and in good shape too. I always purchase items thru Amazon becuase the company is very trustworthy and reliable in the products they sell. Thank you for a good transaction.
1803,307142493,5,This is everything I expected it to be.  It came considerably quick as well with ordering it right before the holiday.
1804,307142493,5,"On the 12th day of Christmas 2012 I'm going to review...Santa Claus is Comin' to town. It's a heartwarming story with tons of good & memorable characters with lots of great songs to boot. The voice-acting is dead-on great. The villains are creepy and give you chuckles once in a away. Mickey Rooney as Santa Claus is heartwarming and pretty good. The claymation was pretty good when it came out and still is to this day. The sets are pretty good and beautiful. The effects are corny but still nice at the time it was done. Overall, despite,some silly moments & plot holes,it's still a great Christmas special to watch every year. I give this special a 10 out of 10."
1805,307142493,5,"This movie is one of the great classic christmas movies. Really glad that I now have it on dvd, since I couldn't seem to find it on vhs when I was younger. Added to our ever growing chrismas collection."
1806,307142493,3,"I like how it explains how all the Christmas traditions came together, but this was not the greatest Christmas special in my childhood. I never thought it was bad, I just did not like the idea of Burgermeister Meisterburger outlawing toys.because of my love for toys, I didn't quite like the idea of it, sort of my same issue with ""Toy Story."" But it is still a good special."
1807,307142493,5,One of the few movies kids can watch without mom worrying about inappropriate scenes or information. Perfect for the holidays.
1808,307142493,5,Perfect!  The classic movie!  It was given as a gift to my daughter who LOVES that movie.  This movie is such a classic and at a great price!
1809,307142493,5,I bought this cause I'm just feeling very nostalgic this year. It was really wonderful to see this again. The DVD is great.
1810,307142493,5,Love this movie i had it on DVD-R but that got all smuged and scratched up and it constintantly freezes and is unwatchable already cleaned it but didn't help so i ordered this planning to order the rudolph dvd next weekend and on christmas eve i plan on having a christmas movie montage and i will watch this rudolph and the first two home alones
1811,307142493,5,I have such fond memories of this movie growing up.  It is the story of Kris Kringle...and is a classic!  A must have for Holiday DVDS!
1812,307142493,3,I wasn't so thrilled with this show as a kid and I guess I'm still not.  It lacks the excitement and warmth of some of the other Rankin Bass shows from the 60s.  It's Ok though.
1813,307142493,5,"A Christmas classic right up there with Rudolph and Frosty the Snowman, this movie has been loved by children and adults alike since it first came out. For the $3 they are asking for it there's no reason not to buy a copy. This movie is one of the few that truely lets you know Christmas is here at last!"
1814,307142493,5,This was a Christmas gift to my Grandson he loved the movie from beginning to end it is a perfect gift that will bring joy to any age in fact I even loved this movie :) after all we all still have a child within.
1815,307142493,5,"wow, only if they had these videos back when i was young. My kids want to watch this from thanksgiving to about March every year."
1816,307142493,5,Just as good as when I was young. Great to sing along to. Love watching this every year. It is great to have it on DVD as the network cuts out parts of the original show.
1817,307142493,5,"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town came to ABC first in 1970, when Rankin/Bass was firing on all cylinders. The visual difference between this production and that of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is considerable, especially with regard to the immense, detailed sets and more intricate characters, designed by Paul Coker, Jr. Yes, there is the same animation ""on two's and three's"" as well as a few modest effects, but everything clicks within the brisk 51 minutes, none of which seem padded.

When I asked him to name a favorite special (in The Cartoon Music Book) Musical director/composer Maury Laws called this his favorite, because he thought every element was perfect, from the cast to the script to the overall feel. Fred Astaire proved added another dimension to his legendary career as one of the best narrators in any special. Mickey Rooney's bravado was ideal for the young Kris Kringle. Keenan Wynn's Winter Warlock was memorable (especially when he gets the choo-choo). And our beloved Robie Lester (read Mouse Tracks for more about her) was the show-stopper when, as Jessica, she undid the proverbial bun and belted out her solo, a great tune in a score that hasn't a dud in the bunch (though sadly, in today's more creepy times, ""Be Prepared to Pay"" may seem to take on an odd -- thoroughly unintentional -- connotation).

Santa Claus is Comin' to Town is so spectacular that it's the visual crown jewel in the trilogy with Rudolph and Frosty. And sure, it adds yet another set of myths to confuse those trying to figure out the origin of Santa.

In this case, the story springs from the mind of writer Romeo Muller, but I wonder if, like Rudolph, this special contains a nod to its cultural context. In 1970, Richard Nixon was president, the war was raging and the counterculture was questioning. Kris and Jessica become outlaws and get married in a forest like hippies (since no town would welcome them), and the Burgermeister does resemble Nixon a little. I even noticed that, when Kris says ""It's not even safe here,"" they're standing among the burned remains of what might have been their small camp -- we get a quick glimpse and then it's gone with no other mention. This is the story of Santa as a revolutionary against political oppression.

Okay, enough with the term paper hypotheses. This is Rankin/Bass at their best and glows like a shimmering holiday display on Blu-Ray. For more about Rankin/Bass and Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, check out the books and blog of author/expert Rick Goldschmidt, who helped save the peppermint mine scene.

NOTE: If you have the original DVD of Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, you may want to hang onto to it, though, because the Blu-ray contains no extras."
1818,307142493,5,"I love all the rankin bass video's I own all the christmas one's, the monster party is kind of dull and the easter bunny one is good."
1819,307142493,5,"I absolutely love this movie, and I have loved it since I was a child. It is an all time favorite of mine, and will be for my kids as well. If you have not seen this, what is wrong with you? LoL It is a classic Christmas movie, that every child should see. It tells all about how Santa and Christmas was started. (not religious. Cute and fun!"
1820,307142493,5,"THIS CLASSIC IS BEAUTIFUL ! I LOVED IT AS A KID , AND NOW I LOVE IT EVEN MORE !!!!!!!"
1821,307142493,4,I could never remember what the title of this show was growing up although I always loved it.  Would have been more meaningful to call it the santa story or something.  All the questions of the santa story a answered here.
1822,307142493,5,This movie is one me and my family both love. We all gather round for a great time.
1823,307142493,5,"This DVD was exactly as described.
beautiful shape, works great so I
give this A+A+A+A+A+"
1824,307142493,5,"Fast shipping, and Tape was in excellent condition.  Somehow these old shows are better in VHS."
1825,307142493,2,"The people at Amazon don't make it obvious that this DVD is in Spanish and is only available in Spanish.  If one doesn't speak Spanish, it isn't possible to watch.  I returned it TWICE because Amazon was unaware of their own product."
1826,307142493,5,"This movie is a MUST for children as it gives the ""history"" of Santa and the start of ""traditions"" for celebrating Christmas and Santa.  This gives the background of Old Man WInter, why reindeer fly and who Mrs. Clause was and is now.

3 generations in this household LOVE this movie."
1827,307142493,4,"I love how all of these Rankin/Bass classics from the 60s and 70s get classic old Hollywood and Broadway stars to provide voice talents; lends a certain seriousness to the occasion.  Here we have Fred Astaire narrating and singing a couple of songs in this 1970 stop-motion retelling of the origins of Santa Claus.  Fred's a mailman delivering letters from kids to Santa, and he stops to answer some questions in the charming opening credits sequence which quotes most of the musical themes from the 50 minute TV special, first broadcast when I was 5.  Santa was an orphan left on the doorstep of the mean Burgermeister Meisterburger (I still love that name) in Sombretown (ok that's a little corny) with merely the word ""Claus"" on a chain around his neck.  The Burgermeister is a mean old dude and doesn't want him, and through mysterious, fortuitous circumstances he ends up with the Kringle elves in the Mountains of the Whispering Winds.  He grows up learning to make toys, befriends all the animals of the forest, and goes back to Sombretown to give toys to the kids - but is met by the Burgermeister's opposition.  Along the way the reasons for the red suit, the flying reindeer, the belly laugh, etc, are all explained, with the voices of kids breaking into Astaire's narration at times to ask him to verify that this was, in fact, how it happened.  Kinda cool even for this adult.

This was along with RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER my favorite holiday special as a kid, though it has faded for me somewhat over the years; I guess I remember the romance between Santa and schoolteacher Jessica (Mrs Claus eventually, of course) as more mawkish and sappy than it was, and I'd forgotten that the fairly dreadful ""My World is Beginning Today"" is full of cool 60s hippie/flower people imagery.  The early parts of the story are really fairly dark and bleak, and it's interesting that, though the Burgermeister has a moment where he harks back to childhood, he never reforms and we leave him still villainous, like Potter in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  The story - original to this film I think - seems a bit influenced by L. Frank Baum's ""The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus"" in the pagan/natural nature of Santa as we see him early on; but at the end a specifically Christian element enters the picture.  Apart from the love song I already mentioned, the rest of the music is pretty good, with ""Put One Foot In Front of the Other"" probably the most memorable; it still gives me a lump in my throat.

In addition to Astaire, the voice talents include Keenan Wynn as Winter, the magician who rules the mountains and tries to stop Claus but is quickly befriended by him; professional voice actor Paul Frees as the Burgermeister and others; and Mickey Rooney as Kringle/Santa Claus, a role he would repeat in THE YEAR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUS.  All are very solid, especially Wynn, an underrated actor and a great vocal talent.  Overall this was definitely more fun than I remembered it from my last viewing, probably a decade ago - though RUDOLPH I suspect will always rule my inner child's heart."
1828,307142493,5,"What a great classic story of the tale of Santa Clause.  Would recommend to anyone with young children who still ""believe""."
1829,307142493,5,"This is my all time favorite classic children's Christmas movie!  I loved watching it as a kid and found it even more magical as a parent with three children ages 3 - 13!  It's a wonderful story filled with catchy songs and beautiful messages of peace, love, giving and keeping the spirit of Christmas and Santa Claus in our hearts not just at Christmas, but all year long!"
1830,307142493,5,"This was a great movie. it was suppose to have been delivered by the 21st. that was the arrivle date that it said online, and it got here the 15th."
1831,307142493,5,"Still my favorite after all these years, it's nice to have a special that can present the HO-HO-HO of the holidays and find a way to tie Santa in to the spiritual aspects of the Christmas season.  Wonderful animation, humor and songs-I am glad I finally got this one on DVD."
1832,307142493,5,"This movie was my favorite as a kid and now, as an adult. I was watching again today and realized that the Burgermeister is really my sister. LOL Who knew?"
1833,307142493,5,"Whats good about alot of these Christmas DVD's that have come out in the last few years is that they present the specials in their original form. One hour TV specials from the sixties and seventies have gone through some edits over the years, most notably the Rankin Bass specials, such as Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer, and this: Santa Claus is Comin To Town.

I watched this one on TV the other night with my kid. He really enjoyed it, as it is one of those timeless Christmas shows that every kid loves at Christmas.

But there was an entire musical number cut from the TV presentation. Perhaps you remember when Jessica (the sexy puppet, who eventually becomes Mrs. Claus) has to free Kris Kringle from jail. And in doing this, she is struck with intense liberation and sexual feelings for him, that cause her to let her hair down out of it's bun for the first time ever (she was kind of a stuck up school teacher at the beggining, remember?) and dance around and sing in this psychedelic flower garden-fantasy sequence.

It is the most out of place scene in the movie, and I guess I can understand the network execs desicion in leaving it out (ABC is Disney owned these days) it's probably considered either too controversial, or just too dated,... or the fact that it looks like most cartoon animators in the seventies were on tons of acid, I'm not sure. But at any rate, as somewhat of an obsessive when it comes to small details, I couldn't get over the fact that the scene was just gone. This happens alot lately on TV. I watched Willy Wonka on TV with my kid one time and noticed that the entire psychedelic boat ride scene was chopped.

But thats what really makes the DVDs a good bet with these spcials. I'm a kid of the eighties. I have no real recollection of what the sixties/seventies were all about but I like the style. For you peeps out there that do remember, you should appreciate the uncut renditions of these specials found on DVD. It is the only way to ensure that your kids, and your kids kids, never forget just how flipping strange you people were in the seventies. Thank you. Much love and Merry Christmas. Now put that foot in front of the other and get this thing..."
1834,307142493,4,"This is a vintage children's classic, even the adults can still enjoy.  Very creative and well put-together."
1835,307142493,4,"This is an enjoyable telling of how Santa Claus became who he is today. Keep in mind that this story is completely fabricated by the minds of Rankin/Bass, not the real history of how the myth of Santa Claus evolved. With that in mind, it is quite inventive.

Where did he get his red suit?
Why does he go down the Chimney?
What about his reindeer and his ""Ho Ho Ho""?

These questions and others are all answered as a young boy grows to manhood while a despotic mayor forbids toys of every kind in his town.

It's not quite the same storytelling level as Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, but it is done well enough."
1836,307142493,5,"Once you get past the usual Christmas movie-viewing to-dos...Frosty...Grinch...Rudolph...Charlie Brown...you MUST check out this movie!  Classic cast!  Fred Astaire!  Mickey Rooney!  Keenan Wynn!

For years the name Burgermeister Meisterburger has rolled off my lips, and this year I finally bought the movie to show to my kids, which they loved.

Add this to your collection, you won't regret it!"
1837,307142493,3,"I loved this as a kid.  So I figured I'd get it for my kids.  And they liked it too, despite the hilariously hokey special effects (hokey to them), so that's why I gave it 3 stars.

But for me, for all the christmas specials, this is the worst.

I couldn't believe the ""Sit on my lap"" song.  Really. Some strange creep comes to town and trades kisses and lap sitting for toys - he should have been arrested for that alone.

And then the way they tied everything to the song was really irritating.  Plus, why did the young man have an old man's voice? Annoying."
1838,307142493,4,I love this movie - it takes me back to my childhood watching it.  DVD is great!
1839,307142493,5,"Sometimes you get sentimental and it always seems to be around Christmas time in my case. I hadn't seen Santa Claus is coming to Town for over twenty years so I checked it out the other day. Amazingly it still holds up which is mostly due to the gravitas voices of Fred Astaire and Mickey Rooney. What's kind of funny is that all the songs came back to me while I was watching them. The melodies have gone through my head from time to time and I had forgotten where I first heard them. This cartoon special explains the Kris Kringle legend in great detail, but the purity of the characters is what makes it so endearing. Yeah, ""changing from bad to good is as easy as putting one foot in front of the other"" is kind of silly but suspend your disbelief and enjoy this feel good hour of old school television. A film like this would never be made in the contemporary USA as you're not aloud to refer to Christmas as ""the holiest night of the year"" on a television network."
1840,307142493,5,Just like I remembered it when I was a kid. My son (11) also enjoyed it alot! The figures are still a great way to do animation.
1841,307142493,5,"This is a special, touching Christmas video.  Wonderful for the kids and to add to your Christmas collection"
1842,307142493,3,"The kids don't know who the characters are, but what the heck...they love it.  Maybe, just maybe some kid will want to see some other work of these guys."
1843,307142493,5,"This movie gives you the history of santa in a fun and enjoyable way, by having random outbursts of song and dance. Dont be fooled by the cover anyone of any age can enjoy this clay animation film. Not only does this movie teach us about christmas but it also teaches us how to care for others by sharing. If your a fan of christmas movies than this is a must have classic!"
1844,307142493,5,"I understand and relate to the people who complain about the Mariah Carey ""extra"" with this video. Yes, it stinks, and they should release these old shows as they were intended to be seen WITHOUT the modern ""extras"". But, in my version it is a separate disk, and I just tossed the thing in the trash. As far as I can tell, otherwise, this is the original version I saw as a child. Of course, by the late 70s, I'm sure my version was chopped up for commercial television. Anyway, I think the video is fine, and you don't HAVE to watch the disk with Mariah Carey's song. Use it as a coaster, or toss it in the trash, or let your 2-year-old write on it with permanent marker. Its a good show for this time of year, and I'm glad I bought it."
1845,307142493,2,"... the Story of the real Saint Nicholas.  If they had started with him as the real Nicholas was, priest and then Bishop of Myra, and told of some of his real miracles, and then added the fantasy elements of his transformation into the Santa Claus of today, it would have been an incredible classic.  A perfect bridge between the Rudolph/Snow Miser type specials, and the Nestor/Little Drummer Boy ones.  As it is, its a fun show with some good songs and memorable villains.  But it could have been so much more."
1846,307142493,5,"With such big names as Mickey Rooney and Fred Astaire donnating their vocal talents, this 1970 stop-animation Rankin-Bass special attempted to explain how Santa Claus came into being.  It will always keep the whole family entertained.  A young man named Kris is determined that the children in a drab village will finally have fun.

Under dictatorial rule of the Burgermeister Meisterburger (obviously hammed by Paul Frees), all forms of fun have been outlawed in Sombertown. Consequently it is a really bleak place for people to grow up. This is reinforced by everything being painted in greys and blacks. Kris believes that children's living in this harsh environment is unjust--and plans to do something about it.

Various facets of the Santa Claus legend have come about (at least according to this particular screenplay) from strategies which Kris and his friends had to develop in order to triumph over the oppressive government.  In this version of the story, Santa Claus is a countercultural radical (also in keeping with the 1960's anti-authoritarian motif which original audiences were themselves living through). The future Santa Claus is a thoughtful young man who was raised by elves as one of their own. They did not even mind he was human!

Determined to reach the children of Sombertown, Kris is aided by his girlfriend turned wife Jessica, who is also innovative and brave. Also opposing cruelty and facism, Jessica is no shrinking violet herself. She is the perfect partner for Kris because both want a world of love, happiness, and fairness. Again, keeping with the era this special was made, Santa Claus is presented as a free-spirit instead of an excuse for rampant commercialism.

Whether this screenplay is actually true, seeing Santa Claus as a young man has always been very interesting. It's a perspective which so many other people have not addressed. This remains one of the more original holiday specials."
1847,307142493,5,"THE STORY: Starting off with a newsreel on the children of the world preparing for a visit from Santa Claus, we meet a mailman named Special Delivery Kluger. After some introductory comments from the mailman, who delivers to the North Pole in a snowcat type vehicle, we see the credits spelled out on mail envelopes, with a stamp representing the actor listed. Inside the envelopes are question from children around the world about Santa. ""Where did Santa's suit come from?"", and more, so that the show can proceed to show where Santa got his start and why things are the way they are. In a sad vilage named Sombertown, ruthlessly run by the Burgermeister Meisterberger, toys are outlawed. On the other side of the mountain, elves are raising a human orphan boy, learned in the ways of toymaking. But a scary Winter Warlock has prevented them from delivering toys across the mountain. Whenthe boy grows up he is givent he name Kris Kringle, and he determines to deliver the toys. Arriving there he meets Ms. Jessica and falls in love, but Kris is arrested for the toys. After his escape he runs into the Winter Warlock, and must find a way to deal with him if he is going to deliver toys. Without giving any plot away, Kris has to find creative ways to smeak the toys to the children and avoid being captured again by the soldiers. Along the way we see how traditions like hanging stockings, using the chimney, delivering at night, making reindeer fly, and a nice/naughty list got their start.

BEHIND THE SCENES:Rankin/Bass studios was the most prolific creators of holiday specials we have ever known. After the huge success of their 1964 stop motion musical Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, they created no less than 14 more Christmas specials, from a total of 35 specials of which many covered other holidays. In 1970 audiences were eager to see what the clever studio would come up with next, their last picture had been Frosty the Snowman the year before in traditional cel animation. As much as viewers enjoyed Frosty, they really liked the stop motion ""Animagic"" that was the specialty of the studio. The only TV specials they made this process so far were Rudolph, and The Little Drummer Boy. The new show aired on ABC on December 14, 1970 and it was in Animagic! It was a one hour special, and it recieved huge ratings. It still airs every year.

This special had the best voice casting of any they made, with Mickey Rooney as the older Santa, Paul Frees as Burgermeister, and Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock. The Mailmans voice and songs were by the great Fred Astaire, and they recreated him perfectly in a mailman figure. There are 6 wonderful songs including the title song, as well as ""One Foot in Front of the Other"". The Westminster Childrens Choir performs as well. Music and lyrics were by Maury Laws and Jules Bass. Writing by the great Romeo Muller who worked on so many of their projects. Character design by Paul Coker, and storyboards and continuity by Don Duga as they did on most of the studios specials.

There are several releases on VHS, laserdisc, and DVD. All in all a terrific show, I highly reccommend."

After his escape he runs into the Winter Warlock, and must find a way to deal with him if he is going to deliver toys. Without giving any plot away, Kris has to find creative ways to smeak the toys to the children and avoid being captured again by the soldiers. Along the way we see how traditions like hanging stockings, using the chimney, delivering at night, making reindeer fly, and a nice/naughty list got their start.

BEHIND THE SCENES:Rankin/Bass studios was the most prolific creators of holiday specials we have ever known. After the huge success of their 1964 stop motion musical Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, they created no less than 14 more Christmas specials, from a total of 35 specials of which many covered other holidays. In 1970 audiences were eager to see what the clever studio would come up with next, their last picture had been Frosty the Snowman the year before in traditional cel animation. As much as viewers enjoyed Frosty, they really liked the stop motion ""Animagic"" that was the specialty of the studio. The only TV specials they made this process so far were Rudolph, and The Little Drummer Boy. The new show aired on ABC on December 14, 1970 and it was in Animagic! It was a one hour special, and it recieved huge ratings. It still airs every year.

This special had the best voice casting of any they made, with Mickey Rooney as the older Santa, Paul Frees as Burgermeister, and Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock. The Mailmans voice and songs were by the great Fred Astaire, and they recreated him perfectly in a mailman figure. There are 6 wonderful songs including the title song, as well as ""One Foot in Front of the Other"". The Westminster Childrens Choir performs as well. Music and lyrics were by Maury Laws and Jules Bass. Writing by the great Romeo Muller who worked on so many of their projects. Character design by Paul Coker, and storyboards and continuity by Don Duga as they did on most of the studios specials.

There are several releases on VHS, laserdisc, and DVD. All in all a terrific show, I highly reccommend."

1853,307142493,5,Just like we remember as kids!  And my kids love the video just as much as I did!
1854,307142493,5,"It is rather ironic to think that the elfin Mickey Rooney would provide one of the best voices for Santa Claus ever in this 1970 stop-motion animated Christmas classic, but that is exactly what we have here. ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"" tells the story of how Kris Kringle became Santa Claus. It all has to do with the evil Burgermeister Meisterburger (voiced by Paul Frees) of Sombertown, who had outlawed toys. Of course, that is heresy to Kris Kringle, the abandoned baby who was left with the toy making Kringle family. With the help of a penguin, the Winter Warlock (Keenan Wynn), and Jessica (Robie Lester), the local school marm, Kris saves the day and comes up with all of the symbols that have been associated with the legend of Santa Claus.

Produced by Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin Jr., ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"" features an above average songs by Maury Laws to go along with J. Fred Coots' inspirational classic ""Santa Claus is Comin' To Town."" These include ""First Toymaker To the King,"" ""Be Prepared to Pay (Santa's Song),"" ""Put One Foot in Front of the Other,"" ""My World is Beginning Today,"" and ""What Better Way to Tell You (Christmas Carol)."" Of course, the title song is saved for last and Astaire makes you think it has always been your song.

The story is told by a mailman, effectively voiced by Fred Astaire, who takes time out from all of his holiday deliveries to set the tone for this charming holiday tale and narrate the evetns. I think of this as being a contemporary of ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,"" but that actually came out six years earlier (the common denominator is that they were both clay-mation productions from Bass & Rankin). The Island of Misfit Toys makes the other one the more beloved Holiday classic, but this one is a close second, and Jessica is the cutest future Mrs. Claus of all-time."
1855,307142493,5,"When I took American History in College, my teacher explained the political undertone of the Wizard of Oz. With that in mind, I was able to see the undertone of this story. First, for parents-as a kid I used to enjoy the annual showing of this feature. Now to the undertone:A baby, Santa Claus (capitalism), is abandoned on the doorstep of elves (industrialists). The elves are unable to get their product, toys, to town. When Santa grows up, he decides that he has to make the trip to town, but first he has to go through the territory of the winter warlock (socialism-regulation). Meanwhile, in town, the Burgermeister-who rules the town with all the zest of a communist dictator, has outlawed toys and set mandatory labor for all the kids in town (how commie of him). When Santa gets to town, he befriends the town schoolteacher (education) and is branded an outlaw for giving out toys (how capitalist of him). A cold war ensues between the burgermeister and santa with santa making an annual raid to pass out toys and foil the burgermeister. The end of this story explains well why communism doesn't work."
1856,307142493,5,Excellent film for those that love classic Christmas stories. Buy it now. That's an order.
1857,307142493,5,"They just don't make Christmas special like these anymore.  There was a whole group of ones like this by ""Rankin & Bass""..If you see these names, you know you have found a gem of a Christmas animated special.  They also don't air these on t.v. like they used to.  This showed up on ABC Family network on Satellite t.v. the other night, and I got the chance to see it for the first time in ages.
It is based on the questions the children ask about how Santa came to be.  The music is rather catchy, I still remember the words to ""Put one foot in front of the other"".  This isn't as good as ""The Year without a Santa Claus"" but it comes in for a close second.  It is worth buying if you like this kind of animation.  (Stop motion, claymation mixed)..sort of like Nightmare before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach. but older looking. You'll have fun watching this one, and will watch it alot.."
1858,307142493,5,"....like a hot cocoa with a shot of peppermint schnapps!
This is my favorite of all the Rankin/Bass specials (and they are all excellent). Many people get all the ""Animagic"" cartoons confused...so I'll try to pinpoint this one. This is not the one with Rudolph (""...the Red-Nosed Reindeer"") and not the one with the Heat Miser and Snow Miser (""Year Without A Santa Claus""). This is the one with the toy-hating Burgermeister Meisterburger and.....the Winter Warlock!!
We get to see Santa Claus go from an orphaned baby raised by elves to a groovy, hip young adult who's outlawed for delivering toys to finally becoming the toy making/giving king of Christmas! We also get to see Mrs Claus as a groovilicious babe in her own right and she finally gets a name, Jessica.
Some charmingly dated scenes only add to the warm innocence of this show: like when Jessica realizes ""her own town has turned against her"" and begins singing of her love for and desire to be with Kris Kringle....transcending into a cornucopia of hippy-trippy flowers, swirls and polka-dots and finally catching a glimpse of her paper cutout reflection in the water fountain in the center of town. Remarkable!!
But, the show's main message is one of love and the courage to follow your heart and do what you know is right regardless of the obstacles that come in your way - so take that!....Burgermeister and Winter Warlock! Some touching moments, like when Kris and Jessica are married in the forest because no town would have them and one of the final scenes where we are shown the contrast of those who have no holiday spirit to Santa Claus, who gives of himself each year, are real tear-jerkers.
A wonderful Christmas special that no holiday season is complete without."
1859,307142493,5,"I will be 33 in January 2002. I only mention this so that readers will be able to gauge my review of this classic based on my age. While I was growing up, prior vcr tapes and dvd players, I and my friends would wait all year to view the various Christmas specials that aired each year. I remember sitting glued to the tv taking in every second of the shows. Back then if you missed part of the show or even the whole show you were border line depressed because you knew you couldn't see it again for a whole year. In some ways anticipation made the viewing of Christmas specials that much better.
SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN(SCICTT) is in my top five Rankin/Bass specials. Right along with RUDOLPH, FROSTY and The Year WITHOUT SANTA CLAUS. I enjoy the 1970's feel this classic has. The flowers that appear when Jessica sings, the simple toys the kids play with and the songs that are sung throughout this show. I can only imagine what a modern version of this show would sound like with its boy band sounding songs and electric toys and video games. Instead of watching Kris and Jessica court each other and wed we would probably see them live together while they consider marriage.
This was a scary classic. The Winter Warlock was very scary when I viewed this as a kid. No matter how many times I saw this as a kid I would always wonder if Kris would make it past the warlock.
I suppose the best thing about this type of Christmas classic is that when people my age view it they can escape back to their innocent youth for a short while. Even though I now own the vhs of SCICTT and soon will purchase the DVD I make myself and my kids wait until Christmas season to watch it. It's not quite the same as when I was a kid but anticipation still increases the viewing pleasure once we do watch it."
1860,307142493,4,"I love all the Rankin-Bass specials, even though they seem to come up with new origins for Santa with each one. Fantastic songs throughout, but am I the only one who finds this couplet unnerving: ""If you sit on my lap today/ a kiss a toy is the price you'll pay""?
That aside, it's memorable and Keenan Wynn as the wizard guy is great."
1861,307142493,5,"This wonderful 1970 video, using stop-motion animation, tells the story of Santa Claus in a most delightful way.  The story is narrated by Fred Astaire, with character voices by Keenan Wynn and Mickey Rooney.  The music is marvelous and the story is enchanting.  It answers the burning questions we all have about Santa.  Why is he called Kris Kringle?  Why does he wear a red suit and have whiskers?  How did he meet Mrs. Klaus?  How did he come to bring toys to children by going down the chimey and why is his workshop at the North Pole?  What is the origin of Christmas trees and how do reindeer fly?
All these great mysteries are revealed in this magical tale about Christmas' most famous and beloved figure.  It follows his life from the time he was an infant all the way to the jolly and rotund fellow we know and love today.
This charming story is an excellent addition to any child's holiday collection.  I rate it a 10/10.  It is one of my favorite Christmas shorts and it is perfect for children from two to ninety two years old."
1862,307142493,5,"First, let's clear up one fact, this is NOT Claymation. It is STOP MOTION animation. Claymation has figures made of clay that are filmed one frame at a time. Stop motion has 3 dimentional puppets that are animated one frame at a time like the Ray Harryhousen figures in King Kong, Jason and the Argonaughts etc. There is a vast differance in the techniques.
This fact aside, ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town"" is the very best of the wonderful Rankin/Bass specials. The designer for the series of holiday specials, Paul Coker, has done an exceptional job with these delightful wooden and plastic creations. We see Kris Kringle develope from a foundling baby to the Santa figure so well known today. Each stage of his development is wonderful. But then, each of the characters is designed and executed perfectly. Watch the delightful changes of the Winter Worlock from mean and evil to mellow and fun.
All the animation is smooth and precise giving the excellent illusion that these figures are actually alive.
The songs are excellent, from the familiar ""Santa Claus is Coming To Town"" to the lovely ""My World Is Beginning Today"" sung by Jessica, the future Mrs. Santa. (For some strange reason, this delightful song is often cut when this production is shown on TV, luckily it is included in the tape.)
The script couldn't be better giving explanations for most of the Santa legends such as how he got his name, how reindeer can fly, why he comes down chimneys and fills stockings. It can make a believer out of even Ebenezer Scrooge.
This has been my absolute favorite Christmas video since I first saw it many years ago on TV. It was one of the reasons I bought my first VCR so I could make a tape of it before it was commercially available. I even have an old LP recording of the complete show. So, do I recommend it, the answer is a resounding YES!!!!!"
1863,307142493,5,"This movie has been a Christmas holiday tradition on television for many  years.  It is great to see that you can purchase this movie on VHS but,  there should also be a DVD with some nice bonus features added.  There are  DVD copies of ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"", ""Frosty the  Snowman"" and ""The Grinch Who Stole Christmas"".  I think that  this movie should be added to this list of classics.  Just about all of the  ""Charlie Brown"" specials are also on DVD. Why not this movie?  All little kids today should still be into a movie like this.  It sure is  better than all of the Barney junk and educational stuff that TV today is  pushing on childern and it is a good movie to have for the Christmas  season. This is still an excellent movie after all these years so if you  still like purchasing movies on VHS then you should get this one.
  Written by Mr. Frank Rizzo and P. Rabbit"
1864,307142493,5,"Even though this one isn't as popular as Frosty, Rudolph, and the Grinch, it's just as magical. I did not know it even exsisted until I was 9 years old, and I LOVED IT! I was introduced to this one fairly late in my child  hood, but it still holds a special place in my heart right next to Frosty  and Rudolph. This is the one with the evil Burgermeister Meisterburger, who  ""HATES TOYS!"". I love this character MORE THAN the Grinch! This  one also includes the Winter Warlock and Special Delivery Klugger, as well  as a not so cocky (for a change) Mickey Rooney as Kris Kringle. This film  is a true Holiday classic that keep Christ in Christmas. There are MANY  religious undertones in this film (just look at the Winter Warlock  Character and watch his development from bad to good.) This is yet another  materpiece by Romeo Muller, the GREATEST author who EVER lived! The man  REALLY understood children. Some people say that this film is a bit dated,  but I would have to disagree. I was born in 1980, and missed the 70's and  it never seemed like it was out of place to me (It was 1989 when I first  saw it.) It will fit right in with all of the other Holiday films your  children watch. No Holiday video collection is complete without this Gem.  The songs are GREAT, the plot is EXCELLENT, and the characters are  OUTSTANDING! You can't go wrong with this one! Your children will enjoy it  and you will too, garenteed!"
1865,307142493,5,"Those of us born in the 60s grew up on these clay animations. Technically, they don't hold a candle to the computer-animated wizardry of the 90s, but who cares. They are still well-done, great stories. And the trip down  Christmas-memory lane . . . who can put a price on that? This one is my  particular favorite. The music is great! ""Put one foot in front of the  other . . . """
1866,307142493,4,"I watched this with my son's and now they have sons.  I especially appreciated that there were CHRIST-mas references in this video, such as the wedding with the cross on the holiest night of the year and reference  to the Lord.  It still could be fun, moving and include the real meaning of  Christmas."
1867,310275288,2,"I bought this DVD to replace the one I had before (and which was lost in a church library), about 8-10 years ago.  The older version had a chapter that corresponded with each chapter in the book, but this revised version had condensed DVD chapters that grouped book chapters, which made it much less useful for my purpose, which was to support a chapter-by-chapter discussion of the book."
1868,310271908,1,"I really had to hunt to get all these, but I am seriously disappointed for 2 reasons. First, the presenter. Oh dear. OH DEAR. I am sure he's a great guy and all, but a presenter fit for filming he simply is not. His attempts to appear spontaneous and unscripted make him look VERY silly. VERY SILLY. You can see straight through it as clear as day. This ties in with the cinematography. Each presenter is teaching an invisible person. The camera angles follow the person if they are walking, or still, slightly to the side of the person. But where is the person the presenter is talking to? Oh my gosh. EYE CONTACT. They never eyeball the camera. It makes you feel very weird. I have never seen anything filmed like this. So the whole entire time you're watching you just want to see who the HECK are you talking to? but you never see, because there isn't anyone, and it is insanely frustrating. So it's like the presenters are talking to you, but they NEVER look at you. Argh. It's an exercise in patience as it just makes you want to slap the guy and say, ""HEY, I'm over HERE, LOOK at me"". The way I am expressing it, it doesn't sound like a big deal, but watch it and you'll find out. Imagine watching Katie Kuric on the evening news, but she's looking to the diagonal all the time, never at you, you'd want to slap the TV.

Another problem is the continual stop-start nature of the teachings. Every few minutes you need to hit play to keep going.

My second serious gripe is the way they have encoded the DVD. Clearly the DVD producer didn't know how to create scripts in the project because every chapter has been saved as a title. This means ripping the DVD to watch on your AppleTV or iPod, computer etc is impossible. To some this will not matter, but for me it's a big issue.

I am sure the teaching is great, if only I could stand to watch it, which I just can't. I have tried several times over the last few months and it's just frustrating. Overall it's an incredibly amateurish project totally out of character for something with Zondervan's name on it. This is why it simply must have a 1 star rating."
1869,310271908,4,very good
1870,310271908,4,Great interesting teaching but it's to get past the camera work.  I used it in midweek services and got complaints every single week.
1871,310271908,4,"First of all, there is the historical background (filmed from the Holy Land) informing the viewer of why Jesus would use a particular Parable and what it would have meant to His audience.  Then, each session has a different, respectable authority describing what the meaning of  Jesus' parable could have.
For our small group who has a myriad of Bible Studies between us, this has proven informative and interesting.  While a bit awkward at first with all the stops and starts, once everyone became used to the format, all went smoothly.
A good recommendation from us for anyone who either is just beginning to study the Word or anyone who is well versed in it."
1872,310271908,1,I did not realize it was a study book requiring the use of videos. That was not evident in the information about it
1873,310271908,5,"it is a good book, and i would recommend the reading of this book to a friend or classmate at school"
1874,310271908,5,I was amazed at the low price I paid for this book. The quality was like new although it was pre-owned.
1875,310271908,5,"my bible study using this ""parables"" is going well.  I find the dvd instruction material is well done and easy to follow."
1876,310271908,5,"This is an exceptional series.  Kudos to Zondervan and Matt Williams.

We selected this series for our new small group.  My wife and I have been involved in multiple small groups for the past thirty years.  I have often found small group material shallow and unchallenging.  Everyone in our group finds this series exceptional on multiple levels.  First, the quality of the material is superb because each lesson is taught by seminary professor who is speaking in his area of expertise.  Second, the format of splitting each video lesson into three parts is very effective.  I was weary of this before we started, wondering how it would logistically work in the group, and how the whole thing would flow.  However, we have found that it works very well, allowing you to discuss the points of each sub-teaching before going on to the next section that builds upon the prior one: Historical context, deeper dive into the meaning, and application.  You just have to be disciplined to keep on schedule.  Third, the personal application (focus of the third video section) and the attending questions are focused, deep, and easily personalized.  Fourth, I have found powerful little nuggets of truth in text boxes inserted in the study guide of each lesson.

We relocated to South Carolina in May 2012 and we're new to the church we're attending.  I have to say, this new small group is the deepest, most mature small group we have ever been a part of as a couple.  Although our group is very mature, I don't at all think this material is only suitable for more mature, deeply committed followers of Jesus.  Its value is not that it is intellectually deep and challenging, but rather that its deep insights are so well developed, well presented, and easily understood.  I think this material will be equally beneficial to anyone willing to sit and participate - from questioning seekers to mature followers of Jesus.

To A.I. who tossed out the entire series based on dislike for the directors decision to have the speakers not look into the camera as they presented: an epic tossing of the baby with the bath water.

Our group has decided to continue with the Deeper Connection series after this one."
1877,310271908,2,Information was good but had trouble when none of the speakers ever looked at the cameras.  The outlines were a little hard to follow. The work book follows the video well but just to much to follow at times.
1878,310271908,4,"Used this DVD as a supplement to class I led using William Barclay's excellent book ""The Parables of Jesus"".  Class thought the presentations were interesting and added to our understanding of the parables."
1879,310271908,5,"I haven't watched this DVD but have been checking them out for potential purchase. The Zondervan website shows several DVDs in the series: The Parables of Jesus; The Life of Jesus; The Miracles of Jesus; The Prayers of Jesus; The Forgiveness of Jesus; The Last Days of Jesus. Also, I cant find in any of the reviews the length of time in minutes of the videos; the Zondervan website says: three hours of teaching per DVD by Bible professors who know how to communicate the world of the biblical text to today's world. I hope this helps someone."
1880,310271908,5,These books arrived in 24 hours and were in perfect conditions.  I couldn't ask for anything else.  We purchased these books for a study group so researched the content in advance.  Amazon provided the best price and service.
1881,310271908,5,"I purchased the whole ""Deeper Connection"" series DVD and supporting books for a small non-denominational church's bible-study.  We have only one bible study for all ages.  We viewed the DVD lessons and then I used the book to facilitate discussions.  I found many of the insights presented in the series deepening my faith and I could see it benefiting the others in this group.  This is excellent in the way it presents information, the quality of the information, and for the most part it does not contradict any particular denomination's faith.  It stays with the fundamental truths that are the Christian truths.

I highly recommend all the DVDs in this series for group and even individual study.  I would buy more if Matt Williams would continue to make more in this series."
1882,310271908,4,The book and DVD program will take you to a whole new level of understanding of Jesus' word and how it does apply to today.
1883,310271908,5,"great bible study, gives interesting perspective, brings much to light to truly understand Jesus' teachings."
1884,310271908,5,This has been excellent material for a small group Bible Study. Prep is drop-dead simple. The quality of the video content is outstanding. I plan to use other DVD's in this series in the future.
1885,310271908,4,"I just concluded my church small group using this video/book and both my class members and myself thought this was very well done.  I advised my group of the quirkiness based on other Amazon reviews, but that didn't dampen my group's response to the videos.  Each of us thought they were well done and very infomrative.  We all agreed some were better presented than others, videos number 2 and 6 stand out as being quite exceptional, but overall every one of the segments had merit.

The viewer must get used to the format.  Each videos starts out with the host appearing soewhere in the holy land.  Then they transition to a biblical scholar based somewhere in the US.  The host only appears for a couple of minutes at the start of each lesson then plasy no further role.  Once we break away from the host, theme music runs again as if we're beginning something new.  After the second set of theme music the video will cite the Biblical reference then transition to the presenter.  While this all seems a bit odd, it really doesn't detract from the overall presentation.

I recommend this for any Bible study class.  My church offered this as an adult education opportunity but now I've learned it is considering other uses.  I do believe this has many options for general church education.  Once my class ended, people were left wanting more.  Since there are many more parables to consider, perhaps a volume two will be forthcoming."
1886,310271908,5,"I have gone through this study twice with two different groups. It's a wonderful study that truly brings Jesus words to life! Each session is full of indepth details regarding the culture and expectations of Jewish life in Jesus' day. Not only do the professors provide valuable insight into the specific parables, but they provide necessary application for our daily walk with God. This study is definitely enlightening and well worth your time."
1887,310271908,5,"The three-volume Deeper Connections series produced by Zondervan is unique. Unlike any other Bible study available, this visually stunning DVD series is taught and written by biblical experts - six professors with specialized areas of knowledge. The three volumes in this study series are :

1.  The Parables of Jesus
2.  The Prayers of Jesus
3.  Miracles of Jesus

The Teachers featured on the series are : Dr. Gary Burge, Wheaton College; Dr. David Garland, Truett Theological Seminary; Dr. Mark Strauss, Bethel Seminary; Dr. Michael Wilkins, Talbot School of Theology; Dr. Matt Williams, Biola University; Dr. Ben Witherington III, Asbury Theological Seminary.

Hosted by Jarrett Stevens and filmed in locations as diverse as Gloucester harbor, the Holy Land, Boston's Old North Church, and Chicago's lakefront, each volume consists of six fascinating sessions. Each session is taught by a different instructor and consists of three components:

1. Historical and cultural background
2. An engaging, close look at the biblical text and its meaning
3. Accurate, encouraging, and challenging applications of the Bible's message to life today

Each volume is accompanied by a Participant Guide which is available separately allowing participants to make deeper connections with a knowledge of historical background of the Bible, biblical text, and real life applications.

'The Parables of Jesus: Six In-depth Studies Connecting the Bible to Life' is one of the volumes of the Deeper Connections series focusing on parables of Jesus. Jesus communicated deep spiritual truths through simple, vivid, and engaging stories. Woven from the stuff of everyday life, the parables of Jesus made the kingdom of God understandable and accessible to his listeners. The study helps you gain new insights into his parables and their meanings that will help you to appreciate more fully their relevance for your own life.

Six Sessions included on this DVD are:

The Coming of the Kingdom
The Grace of the Kingdom
The God of the Kingdom
The Demand of the Kingdom
The Mission of the Kingdom
The Fulfillment of the Kingdom

Highly recommended for all students of the bible!"
1888,310271908,5,"I am glad I happened to come across IA's review shortly after it was posted.  IA's review is not only unacceptable but incomplete.  If you're looking for one opinion about the dvd format and production, he/she may be of help.  However, he/she even states ""I am sure the teaching is great, if only I could stand to watch it"" which implies that the review has nothing to do with the (outstanding) teaching but his/her opinions of camera angles and eye contact.  Allow me to briefly introduce you to the actual content - the main reason why people buy Bible studies like Deeper Connections.

Unlike IA's experience, my small group and I thoroughly enjoyed and benefited from this Bible study.  The guide (or presenter) is actually over in Israel as he introduces each teaching, thus helping bring the text and teachings to life.  Simply getting a glimpse of where Jesus walked, taught, etc. helped me to connect to the text in new ways.  Moreover, his presentations were not cheesy, but informative and natural.

IA may not like the lack of eye contact, but we personally thought it was insightful (plus, why give a 1/5 stars for something like that?). It felt more like the teacher was part of the small group instead of having someone talk 'at' me.  The difference with eye contact was noticeable at first, but my small group quickly and easily adjusted and it never became a problem.  Please do not write-off this Bible study series based on a poor review.  You will be missing out on quality teaching from these six professors who have a pastoral heart and a gift to communicate God's Word to His people.  Zondervan has done an excellent job (also, the Participant Guide is excellent as well)."
1889,310333083,5,This is a very helpful study for an individual or small group.  This book will change your prayer life and the way you think about praying.
1890,310333083,5,How awe inspiring!  I was able to share it with some work associates also.  They were as in awe as I was!  Great DVD
1891,310333083,5,"We purchased this workbook as well as the dvd and ran a small group at our house.  We typically do a couple songs of worship, followed by the dvd video and then discussions from the book. I found it very helpful and challenging for everyone involved."
1892,310396336,5,Purchased as a gift for my husband. He is a history teacher. These DVDs are fun to watch and bring history to life.
1893,310396336,5,"I (along with my entire family) am a huge Drive Thru History fan. When I heard that the first two volumes in the new Holy Land Series were released on DVD, I immediately knew I had to go shopping! :)

Dave Stotts, the host of Drive Thru History again brings viewers into the world of fascinating history in Volume 1: Egypt to Qumran - Covenants, Kings, and the Promised Land; and in Volume 2: Jericho to Megiddo - Conquest, Canaanites, and the Holy City. Each volume contains three episodes for a total of 85-90 minutes.

Typical of Dave Stotts, he brings history to life with his intriguing historical facts and well-done visual effects. And let's not forget his quirky humor! This time he drives through Israel in a Fiat, traveling the roads to the places of Jerusalem, Masada, Samaria, Shiloh, and Beersheeba, just to name a few.

As I watched these movies, I had several ""ah hah"" moments, as I connected the words of the Bible with the places Dave visited. I was able to put a visual with the accounts in the Bible, including the place where David slayed Goliath and the place where Jesus met the Samaritan woman at the well. The archeological evidence is astounding! My favorite part was seeing the place where the Dead Sea Scrolls were found and then finding out a bit about the men who discovered the amazing scrolls while herding sheep.

Perfect for families, homeschoolers, youth groups, and anyone who loves history, especially Biblical and ancient history, these newest volumes of Drive Thru History are a must have for any DVD library. There is nothing objectionable in either volume, although young children may not yet be interested. Also, the brief information about David slaying Goliath may scare very young viewers if they are not familiar with the account.

I highly recommend these latest volumes in the Drive Thru History saga and have added it to my listing of mom-approved movies for families on my wordpress blog.

1895,310396336,5,Thanks!
1896,310396336,5,"Excellent, Dave makes going through the Holy Land so much fun. If you're going to Israel, you especially ought to watch these episodes before you go."
1897,310396336,1,Great series
1898,310396336,5,Informative humorous
1899,310396336,4,Can't go there?  then this is next best
1900,310396336,5,"This is full with fun facts, true history of our bible, even a chuckle of laughter at the funny but sometimes corny host! This really is a great collection for the family."
1901,310396336,5,"A fun and fascinating way to learn some of that history we missed in school! ""Big children"" love it too."
1902,310396336,5,Very entertaining and informative I really enjoy all the Drive Thru History DVD's I was impressed by Dave Stotts presentation

And crack up at a very informative yet sometimes wacky fella
Nice job !"
1904,310691621,5,The women in my group loved this study.  I highly recommend it.
1905,310691621,5,A must buy for all women of God.
1906,310691621,4,Good for men and women
1907,310691621,5,Our young adult women's group is using this as study material and they are so pleased with the ideas and possibilities offered through this DVD series.
1908,310691621,5,"I lead a junior/high school Bible study and we have really enjoyed the CD and book.  It takes a different approach to the women in the Bible than I have seen before, but is accurate in doctrine.  It have many very respected women for you to learn from in the video as well."
1909,310691621,4,We have bible study study class and we are on the 5th woman from this teaching. Our group is blessed by the study and the discussions we have after the video. Some revelations from some of the woman happen to be quite amazing and scary. But the study is encouraging the bible study group to share which is a blessing.
1910,310691621,5,"I am using this book and the CD for an interdenominational, neighborhood bible study.  We like that the study includes ""lecture"" from each of the women who contributed to this book.  The twelve women are separate chapters each with a different author.  The followup questions encourage lively discussion."
1911,310691621,5,This is an awesome women's bible study the characters are not unlike the women we are today . Very relivent for today .
1912,310691621,4,I chose this rating because I liked the subject matter for our small group Bible study.  We desired something that would take Biblical ideals and use them in today's life.
1913,310691621,4,I did not receive the workbook for this DVD. The video is very insightful and informative. I just wish that the book stated was in the package as well.
1914,310691281,5,This really opened my eyes.
1915,310691281,5,Very insightful - Church Bible Study group still enjoying it...!
1916,310691281,5,"Amazing, listen to audio and had to to do the bible study, my friends that went through the study were blown away by the study."
1917,310691281,5,Love this DVD
1918,310691281,5,"Excellent book, excellent study!"
1919,310691281,5,Excellent study for a Bible Study group or small discussion group.
1920,310691281,5,This is a fabulous resource!
1921,310691281,5,"John Ortberg is one of my ""go to"" guys. I buy his books as soon as they are published, and am seldom disappointed by what they have to say. I had no idea this book would be wrapped around John's relationship with Dallas Willard, another great Christian thinker and writer. I am about half way through this exploration of the Soul, and I have to say that in a world full of Christian bestsellers filled with shallow ideas and superficial teaching, this is a drink of cold water for my own soul. I am so grateful for someone who defines Christian faith and ministry less in terms of bigger and wider, and more in terms of deeper. This is a book much needed in our wold today"
1922,310691281,5,"This is John Ortberg's tribute to his friend and mentor Dallas Willard.  As usual, contemporary anecdotes and scholars paired with the wisdom of past saints.  Best understood by the study facilitator in conjunction with the book.  Ortberg communicates with a rare mix of wisdom and humor.  You will laugh out loud, and also be touched deeply.  I bought the DVD alone before the curriculum kit was available and bought the book and study guide on Kindle.  The study guide is also good.  I have since purchased a hard cover book to keep and several to give as gifts.  All the Willard/Ortberg material is enlightening and moving, but to see John Ortberg describe the mentoring role Dallas Willard played in his life at critical times of despair and questioning will be an encouragement to anyone.  This is being presented in a Sunday School class with a 45 minute window of time.  It can be done, but it begs for more of an opportunity for discussions.  The comments from participants are all positive.  This one will change you."
1923,310817730,2,"this is not the version i was looking for. this is the short group version, I was looking for the full version."
1924,310817730,5,Best look into understanding our faith as Christians that I've ever had! Every believer or nonbeliever needs to watch this series. Will forever change your life!
1925,310817730,5,Very insightful!
1926,310817730,5,"In Andy's very own way....the Bible and how to live life come together.  Our Small Group cannot comprehend how each week, the messages speak to us.  It is amazing how important for us to find our own ""Starting Point"""
1927,310893984,5,This is a great multi-purpose book that is done in a very serious but not threating way even to non believers. Solid principles and suggestions for anyone wanting to put safeguards (guardrails) into their lives.
1928,310893984,5,DVDs arrived earlier than expected.  This was the first time I had ordered anything by Andy Stanley.  Guardrails were Excellent teachings!
1929,310893984,5,This is a great teaching. I enjoyed it so much that I bought extra copies to share with my family. The issues brought up will protect your marriage and your family. I highly recommend it.
1930,310893984,5,"When one thinks about what Andy says, and applies it, their life changes!"
1931,310893984,5,Some of the best teaching on avoiding regrets in life I've ever heard. Andy is a very gifted speaker and he is excellent with showing life application of scripture and theology.  Excellent materials!!
1932,310893984,5,". . . for new Christ followers and those long down the Path as well. I have purchased this and gave this away dozens of times. Thabk you, Andy , for your Obedience to His Word!"
1933,310893984,5,"Andy Stanley is solid, Bible-based, and gifted to speak God's truth.  This series was the basis for excellent discussion in the adult Sunday School class at my church.  Highly recommend it."
1934,310893984,5,"Andy Stanley's preaching style is up to date and completely practical. The guardrail illustration for each area he tackles is a perfect visual. We need guardrails to alert us BEFORE we go over the cliff - financially, sexually, and in every area of life. This is solid, biblical teaching, and perfect for group or individual study. We watch them at home and use them with the men from our halfway house. They make great discussion starters!"
1935,310893984,5,"This is a wonderful study by Andy Stanley.  Every teenager and young adult especially, but fits for all ages, would benefit from what he has to say.  Not only is the information right on, but Andy Stanley is a great presenter as he's humorous, relevent, relates some of his own experiences, and all-around good speaker."
1936,310893984,5,thanks
1937,310893984,5,This is great for teens and young adults.  It will be a good open for family communication about values.
1938,310893984,5,The author hits on every aspect of our lives.  Great DVD for young just learning how to maneuver life's twists and turns.  Good price and delivery for a priceless item.
1939,310893984,5,This is a great program
1940,310893984,5,excellent really enjoying it
1941,310893984,5,We have been studying Andy Stanley Bible Studies.  I would recommend this one especially for adults and teens as a guide for their lives.
1942,310893984,5,"Andy Stanley has a way of making God's word so relevant! This gives life style ""guardrails"" for all ages. We have used this for two small groups and have passed it on to many. It is fill of common sense."
1943,310893984,5,"I have watched this before and Andy is excellent.  He really gets to the root of an issue and gives great guidance.  If you are religious or not, this will be an easy watch without tons of religious babble."
1944,310893984,5,"Wow, I wish I would have watched this when I was a teen.  It would have been so beneficial.  Still great for adults as well."
1945,310893984,5,I bought one a few months ago and really enjoyed it I wish I could had something like this 45 years ago it gave practical ways of living your life even if you are not a Christian. I let my daughter see it and she was impress by it enough that I bought each of my kids one for Christmas and each one said that there was information that they could use for helping to bring up their children too and that they have watch it over again with the grandkids because it just had practical advice for living.
1946,310893984,5,"Once you view the DVD, you will want to share with family and friends. Andy Stanley is great. The message hits the mark. You should order two when you order. One for yourself and one to share."
1947,310893984,5,"Everyone should read this book.  It would certainly help young people, especially, set boundaries and save a lot of heartache.  Everything  I have read or seen by Andy Stanley has been excellent."
1948,310893984,5,I like Andy Stanley a lot. I will order more of his teachings. CD are not costly. I gave this one to a young people's church group.
1949,310893984,5,"I only wish I had watched this when I was a youngster.  This video is great for any age, but the earlier in life these issues are addressed, the better!"
1950,310894913,5,Excellent DVD to help with personal study after reading the book
1951,310894913,5,This DVD was perfect. It really does a wonderful job getting to the why's of not allowing ugly things into our spirit. We are fragile and complex at the same time. We should allow only good and positive thoughts in our minds. I am going to purchase many more of these for gifts. This DVD helps to learn how to practice protecting innocence.
1952,310894913,5,"I think this is a wonderful program to get the ""weeds"" out of our Christian souls to be better equipped to serve Jesus Christ."
1953,310894913,5,"Received in a timely manner.
Currently doing a 100 day consecration and incorporate this book along with another as well (by Dr Cindy Trimm) about soul cleansing and it is life changing.
hIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"
1954,375810331,1,I so regret buying this movie. Why is it called Arthur's Perfect Christmas? The kids spend very little time on Christmas and more time trying to convince us that there are other religions just as worth while. Avoid at all costs!
1955,375810331,5,"This tape is pretty funny,especially the part when Uncle Fred's home video showed his dog,Rory chewing on a TV,with Uncle Fred saying,Rory,that's not a doggy toy,when he chewed it up! I would recommend this tape to any Arthur fan."
1956,375810331,5,"My nieces, sister and I love watching this movie every christmas to get us into the holiday spirit.  A really very great and fun movie that is enjoyable for the entire family.  I bought a dvd for my nieces as a Christmas present and also one for myself to add to my Christmas collection."
1957,375810331,5,I don't know what it is about this movie but my kids love it so much. We had to buy the dvd for our minivan. It came quick and does the job I need (keeping kids quiet for a short time).
1958,375810331,5,"According to my kid, this is the greatest Christmas movie of all time. She hasn't actually said that, but she's watched this on Amazon Prime enough that I think they finally removed it as she was using too much network bandwidth. I've never made it all the way through the movie, but I have one of the songs from it forever embedded in my brain. Tina, Tina, Tiny, Tina. Tina, Tina, Tiny, Tina, Tina, Tina, Tiny, Tina. Tina - the Talking Tabby! Please make it stop.

Joking aside. The a main theme of the story is discussing the Christmas traditions of various cultures. While normally these story lines attempt to ruin any sort of holiday magic you might be into, all were covered in a very kid-friendly way that won't ruin things for your child."
1959,375810331,4,I've read better stories
1960,375810331,5,Great movie!
1961,375810331,5,"I watched this movie growing up, so it is almost like a classic to me. It arrived in perfect condition!"
1962,375810331,5,A must for any children's Christmas movie collection. Arthur will always be a classic.
1963,375810331,5,"I used to watch this movie on the tv when I was a child (I am 24 now) and I still watch it. It's by far the best show I saw as a child. It would come on every Christmas at 7 am when I was a child on pbs.  It's doesn't come on now or for the last decade or so. And it's been such a bummer. I used to never received any gifts for Christmas because my parents could never afford anything. I didn't realized this as a child, but I know now.  And what made it better was this coming on and watching it Christmas, year after year of no gifts, this movie that came on at 7 am would be the only thing consistent that would be around on Christmas. So I just though I was a bad kids growing up, but watching this movie made me feel better. It's was literally my childhood and when it stop coming on, it broke my heart. Now that I am older, I can afford things for my family, nieces, and nephews. And I saw today that it was on prime. I literally cried while I put it on for them. This movie makes my heart melt."
1964,375810331,5,great
1965,375810331,5,"My son was always into Arthur as a child, even going so far as to ""meet Arthur"" at a bookstore when he was 3 years old. Arthur always had such a prevalence in our lives that I think I became attached to Arthur, too. :) So it's probably no surprise that I really love this DVD. I also love all things Christmas. So Christmas plus Arthur... well... winner winner chicken dinner!! :) :) :) (Yes, I am kidding. I don't really sound like that.) ;) Anyway, this is a super cute movie, and if you love Christmas cartoons, or if you love Arthur cartoons, OR if you love Christmas cartoons FEATURING Arthur, then you are certain to enjoy this DVD. :)"

1969,375810331,5,"I have shown this film to my multicultural, international second grade classroom two years in a row."
1970,375810331,5,Arthur is a timeless show.  Great lessons for children to learn.
1971,375810331,5,One of our daughter's favorite Christmas shows - just be aware the jingle contained therein will run through your head for months!
1972,375810331,5,The kids loved it.
1973,375810331,3,"This is like my fav Christmas show. My lake of five stars is because they cute one of my fav lines from ""Baxter Day"" when Buster sings, ""yeah baby it's Baxter day"" was cut out. Apparently baby is deemed inappropriate for children."
1974,375810331,5,Great holiday movie for the family
1975,375810331,5,"Fun movie.  I'm not a very PC type of person but I do like how it explains some of the different holidays like Chanukah and Kwanzaa. They definitely acknowledge Christmas as well. People that have issues with this movie and give it low ratings are way too sensitive and need to lighten up a bit. There's some great humor in it. A good family watch. I added it to my massive Christmas DVD collection and is on my""must watch"" list during the season."
1976,375810331,5,Very satisfied!!
1977,375810331,5,We love Arthur! It's great that this film explores other seasonal holidays as well. A great learning experience that is entertaining for both kids and their parents.
1978,375810331,5,It's a great video to explain different holiday celebrations to kindergarteners
1979,375810331,5,A great Christmas 
1980,375810331,5,Absolute favorite Christmas movie - baby loves it!
1981,375810331,5,We were already a big fan of the tv show so this easily became a Christmas classic in our house.  Our kids love it.  A sweet show.
1982,375810331,5,Awesome! An all time classic!
1983,375810331,5,I have always loved Arthur and this special was great. I use it in my preschool class. It help you to see many different cultures.

1993,375810331,5,"I grew up watching this (I'm kind of a christmas freak). Now that I'm older with a family of my own I needed to add this favorite (especially if you love arthur) to my collection of ""must watch Christmas movies""."
1994,375810331,5,a very cute movie
1995,375810331,5,A wonderful Christmas DVD to have I your child's Christmas collection.  I have it in mine and don't even have kids.
1996,375810331,5,Sweet Christmas movie! We love Arthur!
1997,375810331,5,My kids love this episode! It's pretty cute.
1998,375810331,5,Great movie for little ones!
1999,375810331,4,Fun and festive. Grand kids ages 6 and 9 enjoyed it.
2000,375810331,5,Very cute classic cartoon. My kids loved it.
2001,375810331,5,This is my daughter's favorite movie. We watch it every year. This one was just perfect and arrived in time for Christmas.
2002,375810331,5,Kids love it
2003,375810331,5,"This is a very cute holiday special that my 6 year old watched in May and still loved. Everything a holiday special needs (songs, other celebrations besides Christmas, a little drama). We love the Arthur series."
2004,375810331,5,"My son loves this movie! We started watching it around Christmas, but it's now May and he still loves it!"
2005,375810331,5,Wonderful Christmas story for the little ones!
2006,375810331,5,I love this christmas movie
2007,375810331,4,Cute movie!
2008,375810331,5,5 yr old thoroughly enjoyed!
2009,375810331,5,Replacement for vhs.  A favorite of my kids.
2010,375810331,5,I purchase for the kids at the childcare facilty they loves it !!!!!! they want to watch it over and over again!! lol
2011,375810331,5,What a great story!
2012,375810331,4,Great movie!
2013,375810331,5,loved it
2014,375810331,5,Very funny!
2015,375810331,5,"My daughter loves this, asked to watch it a lot during the Christmas Season, but still asks to watch it 3 months later."
2016,375810331,5,Very nice story. Talks about different families and how they celebrated the holidays in different ways.
2017,375810331,5,"I loved this movie. Although it does not go into depth of all of the different holidays celebrated outside of christmas or christmas itself, it is one of the only kid shows that actually exposes children to the existence of these other holidays. It's a kids show so its obviously not going to go into great detail and it has a great message that sometimes we place these huge expectations on holidays and in turn they become very materialistically driven when in reality the importance is enjoying the day itself with those you love."
2018,375810331,5,Was a good movie.  Kept my kids interest.  This is a good movie for the holiday.
2019,375810331,5,"My daughter also has the book, so she wanted to watch this.

She watched it back to back."
2020,375810331,5,I love it
2021,375810331,5,Super cute movie! My son loves Arthur...
2022,375810331,5,Love it!
2023,375810331,5,"My family watches this every christmas, we had a vcr copy but the sound finally gave. THANK YOU AMAZON!! You saved christmas!"
2024,375810331,5,Christmas surprise for my older kids who watched the original on PBS all those years ago . . . And it was a hit now just as it was then. Fun stroll down memory lane and a great message in the video to boot. Fun family night Christmas activity and who doesn't love Arthur even when you're all grown up? And if your kids are younger? This is a must-have video for your Christmas library.
2025,375810331,5,This is a great movie because it has a lot of fun facts about Christmas around the world ! I am 8 and i give this movie 5 stars
2026,375810331,5,Arthur is always a winner for my kids. Great video for little ones at Christmas!
2027,375810331,1,"terrible pointless movie, worst christmas movie ever!!"
2028,375810331,5,Love this
2029,375810331,5,"I love this movie and so does my daughter and husband. It's cute, sweet, thoughtful and full of insight into many types of traditions. Oh, and it's funny of course, it is Arthur after all!"
2030,375810331,5,"My favorite Christmas movie. So cute and makes me so happy, even at 24!"
2031,375810331,5,I've been watching this every thanksgiving since it originally aired! I love it!!
2032,375810331,5,"Classic. I love the original Arthurs, and this one is just fantastic. We've watched it every single day since we got it, parent and child!"
2033,375810331,5,Wonderful movie for toddlers. We lost count on how many times our child watched this movie last year...she still loves it!
2034,375810331,5,It was a 6 out of 5 according to my daughter.
2035,375810331,5,My child loves it he watches it all year round
2036,375810331,4,Cute.. slightly educational.
2037,375810331,5,Arthur reminds me of my childhood.
2038,375810331,5,"Our 3 year old loves this movie, we've been watching it at least once a day!"
2039,375810331,1,I have been watching Arthur for 16 years. Started when my child was a toddler. I still watch it but this movie was not so great. The voices of the characters were not the same as the t.v. show and the songs were blah. I will continue watching the show but never this movie
2040,375810331,5,Best holiday movie!
2041,375810331,4,We love Arthur!  Great movie that teaches to be thankful and also different customs and Christmas traditions.
2042,375810331,5,"Loved this movie as a kid and still do, cute story. Very pleased with this purchase."
2043,375810331,5,My 2 and a half year old loved this movie.
2044,375810331,5,I didn't watch it but my grandson enjoyed it
2045,375810331,4,Like
2046,375810331,5,My granddaughter liked it a lot and sat and watched the whole movie.
2047,375810331,5,Baxter Day!! :)
2048,375810331,5,"Love watching this movie with my 6 year old daughter. We never get sick of it! I mean who could, it's Arthur! Love how it shows his friends culture and how they view christmas"
2049,375810331,5,Very cute
2050,375810331,5,I remember watching the special when it first aired. I almost always miss it each year and I was glad to be able to see it again. Very educational for children's who may not know that not everyone celebrates Christmas or Kwanza or Hanukkah.
2051,375810331,5,Love this movie! So heartwarming!!
2052,375810331,5,"My son has autism and cannot verbally express himself, but he LOVES Authur's Perfect Christmas and I feel it helps him understand the holiday better."
2053,375810331,5,Has kept my baby quiet on several car rides now!
2054,375810331,2,no comment
2055,375810331,5,Good buy
2056,375810331,1,Don't watch!!
2057,375810331,5,Cute kid movie

2059,375810331,5,This is a year-round favorite in our house.
2060,375810331,5,My grandson loves this movie...he watches it every evening before bed and seems to never get tired of it...great choice
2061,375810331,5,My son and I both really enjoy this movie. We were disappointed when it was not longer a Prime video so we went ahead and purchased it because it is so good.
2062,375810331,5,Grandkids loved it!
2063,375810331,5,Kids love it.
2064,375810331,5,Love it.
2065,375810331,1,"Blah. We like Arthur, but this movie carefully respected holiday traditions of non-Christians and then totally blew off the Christmas traditions of...Christians. I'm not a weird conservative fundamentalist, but I am religious, and I don't get why going to the mall and watching movies should be the emphasized traditions of this movie's Christmas observers."
2066,375810331,4,The grandkids likes it
2067,375810331,5,My 3yr old daughter loved it and got her singing Christmas songs in June!
2068,375810331,4,My son loved it
2069,375810331,5,great family christmas cartoon
2070,375810331,5,My 4 year old granddaughter loved it.
2071,375810331,3,Nice one
2072,375810331,5,LOVE
2073,375810331,5,Grandgirl loves this movie! All year long.
2074,375810331,5,"Very cute movie!!!

:))))))"
2075,375810331,5,"Hey, there's a song called Baxter Day!  How great is that?"
2076,375810331,4,"It was fun to watch, reminds me of my childhood everytime I watch arthur"
2077,375810331,5,Good show
2078,375810331,3,grandson enjoyed it
2079,375810331,1,They speak rudely to each other.  Not something I want my children to learn.
2080,375810331,5,One of my favorite Christmas specials!!! My daughter is 4 and she loves it!!!
2081,375810331,5,Great family movie
2082,375810331,5,Present for daughter. Excellent condition. Thanks.
2083,375810331,5,Adorable Christmas movie. Came on time.
2084,375810331,5,Classic
2085,375810331,5,Good.
2086,375810331,5,Simply a Christmas Classic!
2087,375810331,4,This is a good kids book. My 5 and 7 yrs old love me reading this to them. They also enjoy reading alone with me
2088,375810331,2,Quality is not very good.
2089,375810331,2,"My daughter and I love the TV show but this was definitely not as well thought out. Would not recommend for kids who still believe in Santa, could lead to a lot of questions. Rather disappointed."
2090,375810331,5,Classic
2091,375810331,1,The color is of low quality compared with the VHS Tape that we have had for years
2092,375810331,5,"This is one of my favorite holiday shows. I had only seen it before during a PBS telethon, so it was interrupted a lot. The DVD was lovely with no interruptions. The picture quality and audio is great. The story shows the people of Elwood City all celebrating the holidays in different ways, and how all of them are important. For Arthur fans, there's D.W. hi-jinks, funny friend interactions, and cute musical numbers. But I think even people who aren't familiar with the characters would enjoy it. It's for everyone to enjoy, be they aardvark, rabbit, or human."
2093,375810331,5,This movie is suitable for kids of all ages!
2094,375810331,5,Great for the kids
2095,375810331,5,one of the shows we love to watch on pbs before bedtime every night
2096,375810331,5,Love this movie!
2097,375810331,5,Cute--recommended by my 9 yr old granddaughter
2098,375810331,5,The Christmas of 2014 wouldn't have been complete without my kids watching Arthur's Perfect Christmas over and over and over and over and over again! They clearly loved it and ultimately so did I.
2099,375810331,3,"I don't know, im really one the fence.  for Arthur, it was typical and true to the fashion of the books.  I would say D.W. was extremely whiney to the point I explained to my 4 year old I never want to see her act like that.  there is also the issue of Santa where the mother cant find the much wanted gift, and Santa clearly didn't come. if you are a believer in Santa with kids who listen intently to storylines, I would chose a different movie.  the other holidays of hanakkah and kwanza where explained in much more detail than Christmas."
2100,375810331,5,"Arthur's our best aardvark we loved ever since my brother and I were young. Especially for the holidays! Even though we're young adults now, we keep him in touch!"
2101,375810331,5,"I watched this with my 5 year old grandson, we really enjoyed it."
2102,375810331,4,Cute movie.  Kids enjoyed it.
2103,375810331,5,"Arthur's Perfect Christmas has become a regular holiday tradition in our home.  All these years, I've used the VHS tape I bought years ago.  Now, I have the DVD which has a sharper image.  We love it!  Thank you so much"
2104,375810331,5,A family favorite year after year! It is a great way for kids to learn that not everyone celebrates the same holiday and that one is not better than another.
2105,375810331,4,Good
2106,375810331,5,Long time favorite
2107,375810331,5,This was good to show my kindergarten class.
2108,375810331,5,My 4 year old granddaughter loved it a lot!!
2109,375810331,4,my kids loved this! they are 2 and 5.
2110,375810331,4,"My 2 and half year old and I enjoy watching this Christmas episode. I like how they focus on all the different holidays, and the importance of family."
2111,375810331,5,My kids enjoy watching this over and over again.
2112,375810331,5,Great family movie
2113,375810331,5,This Arthur movie was perfect for settling down some excited kids while Christmas dinner was being prepared. They loved it!
2114,375810331,4,My 7 year old granddaughter loved this. It's entertaining enough for adults to watch it with the kids. Lots of music and good humor.
2115,375810331,5,I love this movie.  We watch it every year.  I love the message.  Great family movie.
2116,375810331,5,Great message :)
2117,375810331,5,Love love love Arthur
2118,375810331,5,A great kids movie!!!
2119,375810331,5,"Our family watches Arthur's Perfect Christmas on Christmas Eve every year. This timeless classic deals with giving to others, dealing with holiday pressures, and the different holidays that people celebrate, including Hanukkah and Kwanzaa."
2120,375810331,5,One of our favorite Christmas shows. Love it.
2121,375810331,5,The music is catchy and my son has watched it for years.
2122,375810331,5,Cute show!
2123,375810331,5,we liked it
2124,375810331,5,Still love this movie
2125,375810331,5,Kids 6&4 loved it.
2126,375810331,5,Love this movie.  It not only talks about Christmas but it also has Hanukkah and Kwanzaa celebrations.
2127,375810331,5,Adorable!
2128,375810331,5,Our family watches this over & over.
2129,375810331,1,"We were disappointed.  Normally we love the Arthur movies...but the title to this one was off base.  Should have been called Stressful Winter Celebrations and how to make them all blend.  If it's a Christmas movie, then stick to the topic.  Let us know more about those traditions and customs.  Sounded more like ""let's just not make Christmas that big a deal"", was the theme.  Would love to have heard more about what the spirit of Christmas is really all about.  Why do we celebrate it?  That's what really makes it perfect.  (This was more about being politically correct.  Downplay Christmas and pull in all the other holidays)  I'm a retired teacher and I always enjoyed teaching about all of the winter holidays.  But each one got it's own presentation....including Christmas."
2130,375810331,5,Great Christmas Special. Really enjoyed it.
2131,375810331,5,"A family favorite, even as my kids get older."
2132,375810331,3,Too many real life references. I was looking for something light hearted.
2133,375810331,5,Great show that both of my children (ages 4 and 2)  love!
2134,375810331,3,I liked it
2135,375810331,4,Quality family movie.
2136,375810331,5,Great family Christmas program!
2137,375810331,5,Love it!!
2138,375810331,5,I have always loved this show and this is a wonderful Christmas special!
2139,375810331,4,I watched this with my 5yrs old daughter and she was very happy and noticed other holiday traditions!
2140,375810331,5,"My oldest daughter, now 19 watched it with my 5 year old. Brought back great memories!!"
2141,375810331,5,My son and students love this movie!
2142,375810331,5,We love this movie!
2143,375810331,5,Good!
2144,375810331,5,Sweet!
2145,375810331,5,Wonderful Story!!!!! Grand Kids Loved it!!!!!!
2146,375810331,5,Was a great Christmas show. My son is 6 and still loves Arthur!
2147,375810331,5,Adorable!!!
2148,375810331,5,Excellent
2149,375810331,4,Great movie for kids. My children loved it.
2150,375810331,5,Awesome!
2151,375810331,5,One of our favorite holiday movies!
2152,375810331,4,Great movie
2153,375810331,5,this is an adorable cartoon.
2154,375810331,5,Grand kids loved it and so did I.
2155,375810331,5,I love it! A must watch for the holidays!!
2156,375810331,5,"Very good movie for elementary age kids. Teaches them about patience, the meaning of Christmas, and other holidays. Plus some pretty good songs."
2157,375810331,5,"My four year old really enjoyed this program.  It was age appropriate, entertaining, and cute."
2158,375810331,3,Little old school cartoon. Hard to compete with Pixar. I enjoyed it more than my Grandsons!
2159,375810331,5,Granddaughter loved it. Watched it over and over
2160,375810331,5,Great family Christmas movie!
2161,375810331,5,A beloved family favorite
2162,375810331,4,I was unfamiliar with Arthur other than his books.  I thought this was a delightful show that highlighted how different cultures celebrate the holidays.  It also showed how it was more about caring for others than expecting the latest gift craze.
2163,375810331,5,"This is such a wonderful story to teach kids about all the religions during this holiday season.  Good friends can believe different things, and still be good friends.  I love the simple beauty of it all.  We watch it every Christmas and our other copy was all worn out."
2164,375810331,4,Nice Christmas story for the family
2165,375810331,5,Yes it was very cute & it celebrated everyone Christmas
2166,375810331,2,"We ended up stopping this movie less than a third of the way in. I was displeased with the heavy Jesus references and the bratty nature of the characters. The former complaint is certainly specific to our tastes, but the latter is not. We just felt there were better options."
2167,375810331,5,Wonderful movie. We love Arthur.
2168,375810331,5,Daughter loved it
2169,375810331,5,I really enjoyed it with my daughter! Great message and humor and engaging. Brings me back to all the other great Arthur shows.
2170,375810331,5,The kids loved it.
2171,375810331,4,It was great!
2172,375810331,5,"The grandkids ages 3 years and 5 years loved the movie.  So happy to be able to play it on my Kindle for them outside on the patio.
This is  another reason I love my Prime membership.  Free videos for myself and the grandkids."
2173,375810331,5,"In my 4 year old's own words:  ""I loved this movie because it's about Arthur and Christmas.""

So, there you have it."
2174,375810331,4,The kids liked this one.
2175,375810331,4,My 10 year old granddaughter really enjoyed this. It is in cartoon form but a bit long for the little ones.
2176,375810331,3,Did not hold attention of 5 year old.
2177,375810331,5,Great family fun
2178,375810331,5,Cute movie! We love Arthur!
2179,375810331,5,Cute show!!
2180,375810331,5,"Festive, culturally relevant. My 3rd graders were engaged entirely"
2181,375810331,5,This movie is perfect for my second grade class to see different ways of celebrating the holidays.
2182,375810331,5,Who doesnt love Arthur!!
2183,375810331,5,Great holiday cartoon! My kids are fully grown and we still watch this EVERY year together.
2184,375810331,1,"no substance, waters down the true meaning of Christmas-Actually spends more time explaining the Jewish Holiday than the Christian Holiday.  And then there's a moment with a character and his mother where they don't really know why their celebrating Christmas and decide to make up their own Holiday."
2185,375810331,5,Cute! 6 & 7 year olds enjoy!
2186,375810331,1,Terrible.  Full of Christmas Cliches.
2187,375810331,3,"Granddaughter watched it, but unlike other movies that she really likes, does not care to watch it again."
2188,375810331,5,Ensue
2189,375810331,5,Great movie !!
2190,375810331,5,Love all Arthur!
2191,375810331,5,Wonderful video for the holidays showing that people celebrate a variety of holidays!
2192,375810331,4,Good for 5 and under
2193,375810331,5,ok
2194,375810331,5,A classic!  Love how it covers many faiths and family situations!
2195,375810331,5,Yay Arthur
2196,375810331,5,Son loved it
2197,375810331,5,"Watched this with my 7 year old and 3 year old. It had moments that were specially made for all different ages, so my husband and I enjoyed it just as much as my 7 year old and my 3 year old. The message is about letting go of expectations and learning that things can be ""perfect"" the way they are. I especially liked that they showcased a variety of families and holiday traditions. The length is just right."
2198,375810331,5,My children grew up watching Arthur and I purchased the VHS when the Christmas episode came out.  When we saw it on Amazon Prime we had to watch it.  It brings back a lot of fun memories of when the kids were little.
2199,375810331,5,"What a wonderful holiday movie ! It dealt with different cultures and traditions. It also addressed the craziness that the holiday can bring, but in the end it showed the true meaning of what Christmas and holidays are truly about. Great movie for all."
2200,375810331,5,When I think of a children's  Christmas special this is exactly what I wanted. Arthur is a familiar face to most kids and it focused on the spirit of Christmas and all the excitement leading up to the arrival of Santa. It's a must see for the holiday season.
2201,375810331,4,Pretty cute.  Good message.  Grandkids liked it.
2202,375810331,5,We love Arthur!
2203,375810331,5,Great!
2204,375810331,5,Great product
2205,375810331,5,I love this Christmas store I love watching Arthur with my two nephews
2206,375810331,5,"My kids love all of the Arthur books and also the PBS program. I love the positive messages they get from Arthur. Marc Brown has created a wonderful, fun story that teaches kids about life, friends, choices, and staying positive. He is a treasure! We also enjoy looking for M.B.'s kids names hidden in the illustrations. A fun little extra. I highly recommend all of the Arthur books!"
2207,375810331,4,Entertaining
2208,375810331,5,Great toon for toddlers... it is slow enough to have them understand something special is going on in this movie. The kids were quite till the end!
2209,375810331,5,"It felt strange to try a Christmas movie in the middle of summer, but my grandkids absolutely love this movie!  Arthur has always been one of my favorites; so we are all happy.  They are engrossed throughout the movie and ask for frequent repeats.  Good show."
2210,375810331,5,"This is a favorite of my little lady!!! When nothing else holds her attention, for some reason she comes back to this...Christmas in July!!!"
2211,375810331,5,I have been using this video in my first grade class for years. It includes all of the December Holidays and has a great message of friendship.  I highly recommend it.
2212,375810331,5,"A family favorite for years, we watch it ever Christmas season."
2213,375810331,5,Love Arthur great dvd perfect condition
2214,375810331,1,Not a fan and I thought I would like this.  The younger sister character was awful in this and I also wasn't impressed with the commercialism represented.  I wouldn't bother with this one and wish I hadn't.
2215,375810331,5,Fantastic Cards.
2216,375810331,4,My little sister loves the movie. So two thumbs up! From my eleven year old sister. So yeah good thinking on my part.
2217,375810331,5,"My three kids love this movie, they are 6 and under and it's one of the few movies they agree on"
2218,375810331,5,"This is such a cute program, and had a very good message regarding different people's celebration of the Christmas holidays."
2219,375810331,5,"I was happy to find this available, it is great because it is a multicultural approach to the holidays. Thank you"
2220,375810331,5,"I put this on to entertain my 3-1/2 year old grand daughter.  She was completely engrossed in it from beginning to end!  Many children's movies will not hold her attention 'til the end, but this one did.  Of course she watched this in April so I plan to run it again for her when Christmas comes."
2221,375810331,5,We've been watching this movie since it first came out and looked for it on DVD for years (finally got a copy last year).  It's one of our family favorites. Who doesn't love Arthur and his family?  Nice to have it available on Prime.
2222,375810331,5,"We are all in agreement, this is a must see for the Christmas season.  It has made our family Holiday playlist.  We have been watching it every year for the past 6 years now.  My son watches it well into summer before I can wean him off of it just in time for the season to start again."
2223,375810331,5,"Great music.  Loved the multicultura aspect.  Songs were well written and performed beautifully. Funny, poignant and timely. A true holiday classic"
2224,375810331,5,"Arthur was great when I was younger, and now it's just as good. It's a wonderful show with a great message."
2225,375810331,5,Grandchildren loved it and have watched it several times. They enjoy watching Arthur and I think there are good lessons in them.
2226,375810331,5,"Grandson loved it, we watched it several times through the month of January. Will enjoy it again, I am sure."
2227,375810331,5,"As long time fans of Arthur, this is one of our favorites, and it became one of our must-watch annual Christmas shows. Sticking to the inclusive theme of the show, it also exposes and explains other holidays of the season."
2228,375810331,4,I love Christmas specials and try to watch all of them I can. This was great one for younger children or those of us who are young at heart!
2229,375810331,5,"I am a ""kid"" at heart. Will continue to see this movie around the holidays.  Fun movie to watch with your grandchildren."
2230,375810331,3,"its a good childrens show  i love arthur but, on prime the quality is not that great but im just assuming its because its an older show."
2231,375810331,5,"Great Christmas show and I can't find it in any stores in Canada, have looked for years. So happy to have it kids love it and adults too."
2232,375810331,3,"Fun, engaging British TV.  Will definitlly watch other seasons to catch up. Videography a bit dark for my taste but still enjoyable."
2233,375810331,5,My daughters grew up on Arthur the PBS TV show. Arthur's Perfect Christmas is one of their favorite Christmas movies. This was the first Christmas my daughters could not find it playing on TV. It became obvious that it was time to purchase a copy so they will never spend a Christmas without it. I purchased a copy for each of them so they can enjoy it forever or as long as DVDs still exist.
2234,375810331,5,"My 18 month old loves to watch Arthur on PBS, so this was a lot of fun for herand me!"
2235,375810331,5,My family has watched this for the last several years and will continue to do so for years to come. The storyline is easy to follow and even easier to relate to as a parent or child. The musical numbers are memorable without being overbearing or annoying.
2236,375810331,5,I have seen this show many times but it never fails to amuse. It is a great holiday show for the kids and adults and manages to educate as well.
2237,375810331,5,He sat still and watched the entire thing without interruption. Sign of a good kid movie so I could get a few things done.
2238,375810331,5,My daughter loved and and I liked how they explained how people celebrate this time of year. Even with religious reason for christmas which I liked.
2239,375810331,5,This video kept my children engaged the whole time.  It is very cute and had a special message for Christmas time.
2240,375810331,5,"My kids loved this story of Arthur and his friends celebrating Christmas, Hannukah and Kwanzaa.  A new Christmas family tradition."
2241,375810331,5,My nephew and I enjoyed watching this movie together on Christmas eve!  Great movie to enjoy as a family and keep kids entertained!
2242,375810331,4,"My seven year old grandson is really into SpongeBob, Sam and Cat, and Rabbit Invasion so I was shocked when this was the Christmas video he wanted to watch.  He thoroughly enjoyed it as did I."
2243,375810331,5,"Very cute movie, but different story line than Arthurs Christmas.  I liked how it talked about other holidays celebrated in December, also."
2244,375810331,5,"Kids love this movie, even though they are now all grown up. We watch every Christmas. What a good movie!"
2245,375810331,5,"watched it twice, in two consecutive days and wanted to watch more.
what can you say, she has been a fan of the Arthur shows, and this is perfect during xmas time"
2246,375810331,5,This is a nice movie for kids to watch during the holidays. It really kept his attention. Very cute movie!
2247,375810331,5,I bought this movie to go along with the book and it followed the book very well. The kids loved it.
2248,375810331,5,"A more wonderful Christmas experience can't be had.  Arthur touches the heart as few ever do, and this is one of those shows that is enjoyable for children of all ages.  This is, I believe, the original Arthur cast, and this is voice-acted and drawn beautifully.  Arthur's Perfect Christmas is perfect Christmas family viewing..."
2249,375810331,5,Loved this movie to show children that not everyone celebrates Christmas. There are other celebrations all around the world and in our own neighborhoods.
2250,375810331,5,""" ARTHUR'S PERFECT CHRISTMAS"" is worth 5 stars for anyone young or old that loves the antics of the Read family. DW is just a character and what 5 year old isn't. And of course Arthuir as a BIG brother is no different than real life. What older sibling wants their younger sibling following them around, in their room, or just plain bugging them.. This DVD was great fun for Grandma and the Grand kids. Grandma watched it more than once!"
2251,375810331,4,"My kids love to watch Arthur's Perfect Christmas every year. I must admit, it's even fun to watch as an adult. It is just one of those feel good shows. Every family should take an evening to enjoy this cute Arthur movie together!"
2252,375810331,2,If you want a wide spectrum exhibit of all beliefs including being a Gnostic this is your movie. I am a practicing Catholic and I had to turn this off while watching because it seems to undermine Christmas and try to show that there are many other beliefs during this time. It should have been named Arthur's guide to the winter season and practices. I  guess that is what you get with Arthur type stuff.
2253,375810331,5,This is always a family favorite for us. We love watching Arthur's Christmas each holiday season. I recommend it for any age!
2254,375810331,5,"Arthur's Perfect Christmas has become our favorite holiday movie.  The movie is warm and endearing.  It blends various themes of giving, caring, family, friendship and belief with humor and innocence. Adults will enjoy the movie as much as younger children.  It carefully handles the issue of whether Santa is real - DW is convinced that Santa is real and asks Arthur to write a letter to Santa for her, while her mother struggles to find Tina the Talking Tabbie - the gift she has asked Santa to bring."
2255,375810331,5,"I absolutely love this movie. As a kid, I watched Arthur, but I still watch this multiple times every year. I've always loved it because not only is it very fun, it teaches kids tolerance and helps them understand other faiths and situations. It goes beneath the commercialized coating of Christmas these days and shows that the holidays are about family, in whichever way you celebrate them. Even if I have to keep an archaic dvd player, I want to keep this and watch it with my kids. Even though they can't pronounce lutefisk correctly, I can't stress enough how wonderful, happy, and classic this shows is for me."
2256,375810331,5,Love this movie.  We watched it for the first time on PBS years ago when my teenage daughter was little!  So happy I found it on DVD!
2257,375810331,5,Marc Brown amazing genius!! I grew up watching this show on Kpbs AND WHEN THIS MOVIE CAME OUT I LOVED IT!! the kids loves this I love this reccomend !!!!
2258,375810331,5,my daughter loved it!! it's a great show and the illustration/animation is beautiful  - I wish there were more shows like this that celebrate the innocence of children.
2259,375810331,5,A wonderful holiday movie for kids and grown ups. Sends a great message and in a fun way! Family show!
2260,375810331,5,"Arthur is one of those cartoon, that manages to be engaging while having the ability to wind children down instead of up. We love the opening song and the thoughtfulness of this delightful special that should become one of your holiday classics."
2261,375810331,3,My 7 yr old liked it.  I didn't like the interaction between the siblings in the cartoon.  Seemed like he tolerated or was annoyed by his sister more than I would want to see.
2262,375810331,5,All 5 of my kids have grown up watching Arthur on PBS and we all love anything related to the show.  At some point we owned the VHS version of it and we are extremely happy to have found this movie on DVD.
2263,375810331,4,"My 3-1/2-year-old granddaughter loves Arthur!  This is a typical Arthur movie and she enjoys them all!!!  Since Christmas is coming up soon, she particularly enjoyed this one."
2264,375810331,4,"I think we originally saw this on the TV one Christmas years ago. Our cable provider listed out Holiday shows in the Kids Section during the Season and I found it one year so I got the family together and we watched it. I ended up purchasing it on DVD since it wasn't on the following Christmas and I didn't have Prime at that time. Anyway, on to the review ...

The show has a couple musical numbers in it which is not a normal feature of the kid's series. They're cute and provide a nice touch. The usual cast of characters are there and we learn a little more about each of them and what they do during their own Holiday celebrations. Every Holiday is covered which has become the norm for many Christmas shows; making sure no one feels left out. As such, you'll learn a little bit about each of those Holidays throughout the vignette of the storyline. Sadly, they keep Christmas focused on the commercial end of it and do not touch upon the sacred core about Christ's birth. But, that isn't distracting or forced, it just is. Arthur's dad does insert a nod to Biblical times when he decides to ditch the usual turkey and taters for first century foods. Neither are the other Holiday celebrations forced into the storyline. They flow naturally and overall the whole show highlights themes such sacrifice, friendship, love, togetherness, etc.

Marc Brown's characters are true-to-life in that he does a fine job having them mirror how kids act in the real world. As such, their reactions provide lots of opportunities to talk to your kids about what is happening during the show. At least, that's how we watch shows. : )

Final analysis, enjoyable Holiday fare; fun for the whole family."
2265,375810331,5,"We have watched Arthur for years, so when I saw this on Amazon I knew I had to get it!"
2266,375810331,5,My 5 year old loved this book. She thought it was funny and entertaining. She says that she can read it all the time.
2267,375810331,5,"This annual movie on PBS is a favorite of mine, and now my daughters have taken a shine to it as well. Arthur and some of his friends are struggling to meet the cultural ideal of a ""perfect Christmas."" In the process, they learn that the best holidays are personal, and meaningful precisely because of those heartfelt aspects that cannot be purchased in a store or gleaned from advertisements. This is also the rare holiday movie that acknowledges those people who may not celebrate Christmas. It's a heartwarming experience for any viewer, and makes this father's eyes misty every year."
2268,375810331,4,"My little one has always enjoyed watching Arthur. So when he came across Arthur's Perfect Christmas, he had to watch it. I really enjoy, that I am able to watch my Amazon Prime shows on my iPad."
2269,375810331,5,"I've always liked the Arthur episodes on PBS and watched them with all the kids. So, to have a movie with Arthur and the gang was a pleasure! Christmas is a time for family, joy and sometimes a helping hand to makes things even better. This movie is one of those. Great for kids of all ages."
2270,375810331,5,It is a good example of how children can get along. Cleverly written and emphasizing the right things. Good for ages 2 and up. We listen to the CD of the music around Christmas when we get tired of elevator Christmas music.
2271,375810331,5,"My son loves Arthur, and can't get enough of this Christmas episode! It is a nice one to watch together as a family, and it is a shorter film, so my son maintains interest."
2272,375810331,5,My five year old grandson absolutely loved it. He actually watched it 3 times and then still wants to watch it again.
2273,375810331,5,My kids still watch it over and over again even though it is not winter anymore.... fun for all ages
2274,375810331,5,This is such a nice Christmas video. The story line is good with several plots intertwining. One of our favorite picks for the season. It is appealing for both small children and older.
2275,375810331,4,"Since discovering Arthur on my iPad, my 5 year old granddaughter has asked to watch it at least once a day. Too much screen time for her, but I know she would give you a big thumbs up! I hope you can continue to offer more educational, fun PBS programs for intelligent children. Thanks, I guess, for Arthur!"
2276,375810331,5,Fun family times with good family values. My 6 year old daughter will watch this over and over again every few weeks.
2277,375810331,4,Arthur is always on the top of my child's list. Never naughty and always nice.this one bring joy to us all and to all a good night
2278,375810331,3,"My special needs grand daughter took a little extra time and found she had the dvd so never reviewed it. In the mean time the return window expired for a full refund and exchange. So, I am not reviewing the movies but I think around the holidays there should be extra time for a child to review their gifts. I will send the movies back. arthurs perfect christmas and good sport."
2279,375810331,5,"My kids have been asking for this video (kids are in their late teens and 20s). It was a favorite of their's when they were little, and now it's finally available on DVD. The movie is perfect, shipping was fast. Love it!"
2280,375810331,4,"Bought this for my daughter and she really likes it, she saw it prior to purchase so new it would be a hit"
2281,375810331,5,I was so excited Christmas morning when I received this DVD as a gift. I have been looking for it since my teenagers were little and we watched it as a PBS special. We settled in and watched it with joy and excitement. My kids and I enjoyed recapturing a small part of their preschool years!! Thanks to my sister and Amazon for a great gift!
2282,375810331,5,"We had this on VHS, and wanted to update our collection.  Years later this movie is still a hit with our girls.  it's a family tradition now to watch this.  Arrived in great condition!"
2283,375810331,5,"I saw this movie on tv and loved it. Since my daughter loves watching Arthur, i knew she would like this Christmas Arthur movie. I ordered it for her, got it within 1 week, and she loves it! Great seller, DVD came in perfect condition, just as advertised. Great Christmas movie for any Arthur fan!"
2284,375810331,5,"This brings back great memories!  I love this Christmas special! The playback was excellent, and te audio was very clear!"
2285,375810331,4,LOVE this movie!  All time family favorite since the kids were small...we watch it every year.  glad to find it on dvd.
2286,375810331,4,"I choose this rating because it's ""Authur"" a very wholesome cartoon for this generation of children.  The only reason as to why it did not receive 5 stars was because the voices are different...I'm not one for changing character voices although I realize Authur can't stay eight years old forever.  I just like the focus being in the everyday life of a little boy who's dealing with growing pains lol.  I would recommend it however don't depend on the episode to put you in the Christmas spirit alone... :)"
2287,375810331,5,My children LOVED this movie growing up. We love watching it together now that they are grown. So happy to see it available in DVD format. BEST.Movie. EVER!
2288,375810331,5,"Perfect for the holidays in grade 1.  Lessons include customs and traditions in other countries, being thankful for our families, how to handle getting a gift you didn't think you wanted and it's told through our beloved Arthur."
2289,375810331,5,"My sister couldn't have been happier to receive it.  We watch it every year on Christmas Eve.  Absolutely no problems with the tape itself and the box was in great shape too.  I was worried it wouldn't get to me in time, but it came very quickly.  Great seller, I'm very thankful"
2290,375810331,5,"I've grown up watching the show Arthur and have always loved the show. And I have always loved this Christmas movie. I searched and searched last year for this DVD but couldn't find a good deal on it. I am so happy they finally put it on DVD! I'm 22 years old and I STILL love watching this movie every Christmas. If you grew up watching Arthur, you'll like Arthur's Perfect Christmas :)"
2291,375810331,5,"Timeless classic. Superb Arthur video, perfect for everyone.  We all love it and know the songs.  Wouldn't be a merry Christmas without it."
2292,375810331,5,"My family and I love this Holiday special.  In fact, we think it is one of the best we have ever seen.  We look forward to seeing it every year on PBS and decided that we should have our own copy. Why do we love Arthur's Perfect Christmas?  Well, it is family friendly, entertaining AND educational.  They discuss Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, St. Lucia Day and a non-religious celebration all wrapped up with an interesting story (and a lesson or two) about friendship, family and the true spirit of the holiday season-regardless of your religion. Definitely a classic in the making-a must see!"
2293,375810331,3,I rented this movie for my kids this weekend while we were laid up with fevers.  It was just okay...  I found it was educational regarding other cultural and religious celebrations surrounding Christmas-time.  But I'm annoyed by whining.  Arthur's little sister is bossy and whiny and speaks in an ugly tone - not how I want my children to talk to each other OR to me.  This is why I rated it low.
2294,375810331,5,Arthur's Perfect Christmas is a great movie that my little sister and I started watching when we where 10 and 12 and now we are 22 and 24 we still watch it every Christmas morning right when we get up! Its a great movie and its fun to watch!
2295,375810331,5,"This is such a great family movie.  Reminds me of when my sons where very young.  And now, even though they  are entering their teen years, they were still enthralled.  There's just something comforting about an old family favorite."
2296,375810331,5,"Our family watches this every year at Christmastime.  It's a great little story...Arthur has to rethink what it means to have A PERFECT CHRISTMAS when things don't go as planned.  Helps kids understand that it's good to be resilient.  Also, it reveals what truly is most important.  I like the Arthur series, because the characters are all so believable...they all have their struggles and strengths.  Just like us!"
2297,375810331,5,"By far this is my kids' favorite Christmas movie. At first when they were really young I worried about the obvious dilemna the mother had about not finding the Hot Toy that year, giving away the secret to Christmas ""magic"".  But they never made the connection.  Every year since, they have asked to watch this movie on the way back from Grandma and Grandpa's house in the car on Christmas Eve. This year, we can't find the DVD in our Christmas bins! I'm so relieved to find it here on Amazon because it's pretty old (not sure why to says it was released this year, it's at least 10 years old). My kids are now 11 and 13 and still say it's their favorite. I'm buying another one. It's a very sweet movie."
2298,375810331,5,My 7 year old and 3 year old enjoyed the movie. Both were engaged in watching the show. They liked the songs.
2299,375810331,5,worth the $$ to purchase my little guy loves Arthur.  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all !!
2300,375810331,5,"Arthur's Perfect Christmas is a tradition in our family.  It used to be shown on PBS Kids every year and so we got the CD so we could sing the songs in the car.  Then they stopped showing it and it wasn't available on Netflix so I bought the DVD.  My 16 year old son who grew up with Arthur was so happy to share the movie with his 8 year old sister who hasn't seen it since she was very little.  Francine sings a Hanukkah song and The Brain a Kwanzaa song and there is just so much holiday fun - this will very quickly become a favorite in your house, as well!!"
2301,375810331,5,"I already knew what I was getting when I ordered this; I've seen the televised special about a dozen times.  Our local PBS station has not been broadcasting it recently, so when I saw it was coming to DVD (and at a great price)I just grabbed it.  This disc is pretty bare-bones, but I wasn't getting it for behind-the-scenes information or a lofty commentary.  I just wanted to see Arthur and his friends.  This does the trick.

The special is an hour instead of the series' usual half-hour.  The extra time is nicely used to show the different ways that Arthur's friends celebrate the holidays.  We learn that the Brain and his family celebrate Kwanzaa, that Francine and the rest of the Frenskys go to the movies on Christmas, and that Muffy is too oblivious to realize that her insistence on Christmas parties and trappings is offensive to her friend Francine.  We see Buster and his mother, and a sweet, sweet depiction of how Binky Barnes spends his Christmas.  DW and her lust for this year's Christmas ""it"" and Arthur's wish to give his mother the perfect present are the components of the A story.

Sweet, gentle, appealing to both children and adults, ""Arthur's Perfect Christmas"" is a treasured addition to our holiday movie/special stash."
2302,375810331,5,This is one of the best children's videos to introduce other holidays and traditions in addition to Christmas. So glad I bought it.
2303,375810331,3,"Looking for something to watch with the kids (3 & 7), threw a dart at the free ""Amazon Prime Kids' Videos"" and watched this.  It is reasonably enjoyable but not much more.  There are quite a few story lines going on at once (Buster's mom and her emotional issues at Christmas, Arthur's search for the perfect Christmas present for mom, DW's anxiety over whether or not she'll get what she really wants from Santa, etc) so it isn't really focused enough to command much of an identity.  It's hard to capture much magic with a few too many varied story lines shifting back and forth.  My biggest complaint is the very forced multicultural element - not surprising since this is a PBS program, but it felt too educational & preachy in its covering of all the faith bases.  I'd prefer they make some unique holiday shows about Hanukkah and Kwanza instead of forcing the politically correct gamut at the expense of a more engaging story.
I imagine if your kids are fans of Arthur they'll enjoy this one just fine.  There's nothing especially wrong with it, but there's also nothing especially memorable about it either.  Worth a rental at best."
2304,375810331,2,My kids are young (under the age of 4) and couldn't get into this. Plus I don't enjoy movies about Christmas when they're really about being politically correct.
2305,375810331,5,My family loves this movie.  We've watched it ever since it came out.  My 4 boys are now ages 13-20 and on Christmas eve we all watched it together...and sang along to all the songs. I love how all the different holidays and traditions are represented and there are no apologies made for any of them. I think it will be our new family tradition!
2306,375810331,5,"I HAVE THIS MOVIE ON VHS. NO DOUBT IT;S A WONDERFUL HOLIDAY MOVIE. BUT ALMOST 42.00 FOR THE MOVIE IS TOO,TOO MUCH."
2307,375810331,5,I have been watching this movie since i was a wee little lad and i still love it and watch it every christmas and whenever i feel like watching it cause it is soo good. it has good songs that are fun to sing along to and has some good lessons in it and even some good cooking lessons. it is informational about christmas and i just love this movie reccomend it to kids and grown up of all ages.
2308,375810331,5,"this movie is awesome! i watched it on pbs when younger and came across it , so i decided to get it and now im happy i did. arthurs perfect christmas is a christmas movie you can watch any time of the year and feel like christmas as already here... it also has great songs in it that you can sing along with...if you don't own one, you gotta get one now!!"
2309,375810331,5,My family loves this movie and had the VHS version. The VHS was wearing out and so I gave them the DVD for Christmas. Anyone with little kids should purchase this DVD to add to their Christmas collections.
2310,375810331,1,"This is one of my sons' favorite holiday movies. They began watching it when they were 7,4 and 2 and have continued to watch it several times every holiday season. They are now 18, 15 and 13."
2311,375810331,5,the product arrived in perfect condition and in a timely manner.  i would order from this person again was very pleased.
2312,375810331,5,"I personally like this show because it shows a brief glimpse of the Swedish holiday St. Lucia Day celebrated by George's family.  (Oddly enough St. Lucia's story originates in Italy, but is not celebrated there.  Even swedes have no idea why we celebrate it  . . . I guess because it is so dark in the winter there.)  Also, the Brain's family celebrates Kwanza, an african american holiday created in the 1960's, I believe."
2313,375810331,5,"this is a complex but fun look at the holidays- ALL the holidays, in the modern spirit, while holding to tradition. there is silliness and education. there is much for kids to learn in this movie, and much to ponder.
there is patronage paid to all the celebrations, without being just PC about it.
There is the christian sacred and historical element at the same time.

there are disappointments and expectations.

and there is rain.

there is growing up to be done at christmas.

and perfection is found in the imperfect.
(which sounds like true christmas to me!)

ps: this is also like an hour long, so there is LOTS of info and songs and junk in it! this is a treat for any Arthur episode, which are usually only 12 min."
2314,375810331,1,This was terrible I never even received this item I only forgot about it because of the holidays.  I was so busy I only remembered when my children had asked to watch it on pbs
2315,375810331,5,"We bought this for our nieces. We are Marc Brown fans and have enjoyed Arthur for years. My children have enjoyed this DVD since it was released, the main characters celebrate the holiday season in their own unique ways. The program includes different religions and traditions."
2316,375810331,5,"Purchased to replace a lost VHS copy, this DVD was perfect.  Great packaging, good quality, and a excellent price.  It may not be some highly praised show, but I've always loved it and this DVD was exactly what I wanted."
2317,375810331,5,My sister and I have watched Arthur since 1997 and we love it! I'm now  in college still watch the show when I have time.  Arthur's Perfect Christmas is a great movie to watch during the holidays. If you haven't seen it you should.
2318,375810331,5,I was very pleased with my purchase.  Received it very quickly and it was in perfect (seemed new) to me.  I would most definitely order from them again.
2319,375810331,5,We own a lot of kid's DVD's and this one is my 4 year old's favorite.
2320,375810331,5,My whole family has watched Arthur since 1997 and we love it! My kids are now teenagers and still love to watch this show. Arthur's Perfect Christmas is one of our favorite holiday shows. We hope Arthur continues forever!
2321,375810331,4,"Love Athur, and love this movie.  I am so glad I added it to my collection of Holiday favorites."
2322,375810331,5,This movie is perfect if you have young children. My daughters are 8 and 4 and they love Arthur.
2323,375810331,5,"Item came in perfect shape & timing. Great service & saved me hours & gas trying to find it.

Thanks,

Nelda"
2324,375810331,5,We should all be as lucky as Arthur and have the perfect christmas with snow.  We were all happy for Arthur.  Great Christmas DVD.  The whole family enjoyed it.
2325,375810331,5,"My 4-year-old daughter LOVES this DVD. It is a perfect movie for the holidays. A nice message, catchy tunes - WE LOVE IT!"
2326,375810331,5,"If you're familiar with the Arthur program airing on PBS, you already know just how clever this show can be. Created by Marc Brown and based on his books, Arthur Read is an aardvark who shares adventures (and misadventures!) with friends like Buster Baxter (a rabbit), Francine Frensky (a monkey), Binky Barnes (a bulldog), Muffy Crosswire (a very RICH monkey), and others. Arthur is often at odds with his little sister D.W. (Dora Winifred) which makes for much of the shows comedic moments.

In Arthur's Perfect Christmas, the scene begins with Arthur sitting at the piano, softly playing Pachebel's Canon. This movie, like the TV show, uses day-dream sequences--and Arthur plunges into a snazzy song called ""Perfect Christmas"". You see, this holiday, Aruthur wants it to be absolutely PERFECT...but things go wrong in the town of Elwood City, for both Arthur AND his friends!

For example, Muffy expects Francine to attend her big Christmas party, but Francine has told Muffy REPEATEDLY that her family is having a Hannukah gathering the same night. What happens when Francine doesn't show up for the party to receive her present?

Buster Baxter worries about his Mom who seems to obsess over having a perfect Christmas for her son, especially since the divorce. Buster comes up with ""Baxter Day"" which takes the pressure of his Mom and displays the true meaning of the holidays--love and kindness.

Arthur searches the mall for presents for his parents, D.W. is desperate for a Tina the Talking Tabby (whose theme song haunts Arthur everywhere he goes!), Uncle Fred makes an unexpected visit on his way to a Floridian Christmas, and Arthur's Dad insists on making an ""authentic"" dinner that was likely served in Bethlehem over 2000 years ago.

Holidays such as Kwanzaa and Hanukkah are also highlighted making this a fun and informative DVD.

I bought the Arthur's Perfect Christmas DVD for my son several years ago and it's STILL his favorite. I just brought out the Christmas DVD's and VHS's and he plays this one several times a day. It's filled with fun songs (24 of them!), witty banter, and clever wordplay. Not only that, there's a great message that expectations often disappoint and that a wonderful experience can arise out of mishaps and situations not going as planned.

This 60 minute DVD doesn't have any extras (except for previews of other Arthur DVD's), but this excellent movie is well worth the price in my opinion. My husband and I get a kick out of the cleverness shown in Arthur TV series and this movie is no exception. And as I said, it's my son's favorite holiday movie.

Highly recommended for kids and parents alike!"
2327,375810331,5,"I can't believe this only got 4 stars. I have a 9-year old and a 3-year old. They love the movie so much they watch it year round. Arthur has a perfect Christmas because of his family and friends and there is no mention of what he got for Christmas: I find that refreshing. There is a very respectful treatment of everyone else's holiday traditions, whether they celebrate Hanukah, Kwannza or nothing at all."
2328,375810331,4,"I'm a fourteen year old guy and I still love this show as does my older brother who is nineteen. The jokes in the tv episodes go way over some kids heads and even over some adult's and when you catch them you wanna pee your pants. In this movie its less of the adult jokes, more random funny stuff. You have to love the way that in this movie (and alot of the episodes) they have a great way of ripping on toys/movies/books...Its awesome. With how cheap you can get this I would have to say...Watch the show first then go for it."
2329,375810331,5,"""What a wonderful kind of day when we can learn to work & play & get along with each other!""

Arthur is a rare kind of cartoon that is made for everyone; it is about a community of very different characters that live together peacefully and are accepting of one another.  No matter how different they are from each other, they ""get together and make things better by working together,"" with open eyes, ears, and minds, knowing that ""every day when you're walking down the street, everybody that you meet has an original point of view.""  The Arthur Christmas special does exactly what is expected of it: it applies the cartoon's main theme to the holiday season & places it in a story told from the point of view of a little boy who always tries to understand others' points of view.  It may not be everyone's perfect Christmas, but it is ""ARTHUR'S Perfect Christmas.""

On this page we have another case of people reviewing their religion instead of the DVD.  Don't be turned off by the reviews that say Arthur is anti-Christian; all of my family and friends, both Christian and non-Christian, love watching the Arthur special with their kids every year.  (Contrary to the popular misunderstanding, the holiday now known as Christmas was not invented as a Christian holiday; it was only adopted by Christians in the 1800s, so there is no reason that all Christmas specials have to be Christian Christmas specials.)  Also, consider the source of a critique before letting it affect your decision to see the movie.  For example, puremorals4ever over-criticized Arthur in his review in the name of his religion, though he gave 5 stars to SpongeBob SquarePants, which had a Christmas special that was very much less catering to the reviewer's fundamentalist Christianity than the Arthur special was.

After reading all of the reviews, I STILL don't know if it this DVD is good enough in quality to replace my old VHS copy.  Reviewers, tell me about the special features; tell me about the sound and picture quality; tell me if it doesn't work in some DVD players.  Each shopper has a different idea of what a ""puremoral"" is; shoppers don't care if the storywriters' values are different from those of one individual buyer.  What shoppers want to know about is the quality of the DVD, not whether or not you agree with the Arthur writers' message that a community works best when each person works together and realizes that others have views that are different from their own."
2330,375810331,5,We have watched this Arthur movie countless times. We celebrate Chanukah and enjoy watching Francine celebrate with her family...it is always a beautiful moment when the menorah is lit for everyone to see. You can be of any religious faith to enjoy this movie...the kids and I love it(and I'm 40!) We highly recommend it.
2331,375810331,5,"A great holiday favorite with lots of music, and different holiday traditions to learn about!! Highly recommened!!"
2332,510539610,5,"This is a great product! I appreciate how well each exercise is described and shown visually so it's easy to follow along without feeling like you need a translator to understand them.  I also like the fact that I can DO the exercises as shown (and I am no gymnast...just an everyday mom).  I highly recommend this product!

2333,510539610,5,"If your doctor has recommended pelvic floor physical therapy this a good alternative to scheduling times at a clinic.  Within three weeks of beginning the program, three times per week, I had significant improvement.  That was just using the first 3 workouts on the dvd.  I haven't attempted the fourth workout yet.  Not that it looks too hard, I just want to get a pilates ball if I'm going to do it. These exercises work more than just the pelvic floor.  There are several muscles that work in conjunction as is explained on the dvd.  It also shows patients of all ages and fitness levels performing the exercises so don't be put off if you're out of shape - they aren't that hard to do. I planned to go on to a clinic if this wasn't helping me but that won't be necessary now.  Saved me time and money. Well worth the $29 to see if it will work for you."
2334,510539610,5,Great DVD.  I feel healthier and happier after including the exercises into my routine.  Thanks to Tasha Mulligan for creating the DVD.  I only wish that I knew about the exercises years ago!
2335,510539610,5,I can't say enough great things about this DVD - excellent!!
2336,510539610,5,"I've gone through all four workouts in about five weeks, and I have seen a very significant improvement!  If only I had known earlier that you really can improve your situation all on your own!"
2337,510539610,5,Great workout! Really great details on how to do the workouts with the option to skip the teachings and just do the workout alone.
2338,510539610,5,Very helpful info
2339,510539610,3,The person that presented the video was very knowledgeable but it could've been presented in a more interesting way so it was more engaging.
2340,510539610,5,"I bought after I had a vaginal wall prolapse after having my first child  due coughing super hard from bronchitis.  I was pregnant with my second child, and did not want to that happen again.  Even with only using this 1-2 times per week, I noticed a big difference.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone with vaginal wall prolapse, or anyone with stress urinary incontinence.  The video is boring, but it works!"
2341,510539610,1,"I discovered I had a vaginal prolapse after having issues removing a tampon (I typically wear pads, but was in a bind back in May and wore a tampon for the first time in my life). The prolapse is most likely from the birth of my daughter two years ago. I began my research on what to do for it, as I don't want to have or eventually have surgery for it (I've heard way too many horror stories). I started doing this DVD back in the very beginning of June...and instead of doing it three times a week, I ramped it up to roughly one workout every day/other day. I cycled through exercises one through four for each day I did it. I went out and bought an exercise ball (well, two - a large and a small) and additional stretch bands. I also did kegals, as suggested, throughout the day everyday (held kegal for 8 seconds with four quick flicks). It is now mid-July and my vaginal prolapse is no better and no worse than when I started the exercises. Literally no improvement whatsoever.

Does this have the possibility to help other women? It apparently has and probably will for some, but it did absolutely nothing for me."
2342,510539610,5,I have not tried yet but am excited to try. The cost of this is A LOT cheaper than a physical therapy appointment. After  having a severely complicated hysterectomy/bladder mesh surgery this gives me hope. Will update after using for a few weeks. I also urge anyone considering surgery....PLEASE CONSIDER PHYSICAL THERAPY BEFORE GOING UNDER THE KNIFE!! Surgery complications CANNOT BE UNDONE!
2343,510539610,4,Good exercises for pelvic flood
2344,510539610,5,Excellent!
2345,510539610,5,"Every woman in midlife, or before, should own this DVD."
2346,510539610,5,"Excellent teaching and exercises for pelvic organ prolaspe. DVD is excellent! I  am glad I found out about this DVD.  I am going to a physical therapist  and this was just a reinforcement and some extra info the PT did not cover. Need to learn as much as possible to recover and live a life again.  I am 60 and have a mild prolaspe of bladder, rectum , uterus,  and cervix. I could not function without a tremendous amount of pelvic pressure before starting physical therapy, now after 2 1/2 months, I was able to hike up to 12 miles again, bike, and garden. Doctor had suggested surgery or pessary, but so far I have just been faithful in the exercises given and have seen great results!"
2347,510539610,5,Life changing! I was so depressed after I got a pelvic prolapse after working out too hard after having my 3rd baby! Now I feel back to normal and my abs are amazing! I did this video only 5x a week for 6 weeks and didn't lift anything heavier than my baby! Can't wait to try the advanced video!
2348,510539610,5,"I am 61 and recently had trouble with leakage when running or doing high-intensity cardio exercise.  I'm in my second week of Pelvic Floor DVD, still on exercise group 1, but can now do high jumps, 18 at a time without a problem and jumping jacks.  I also notice the feeling to urinate all the time is disappearing. I kept doing the full workout with the explanation as I was not certain I was doing it correct but I have now moved on to the express workout. Will work on No. 2 next and continue.

I like the fact that Tasha works the surrounding muscles to help support the pelvic muscles.  I also like her manner and presentation; it is straight forward aid direct.

I also like the fact I did not receive any e-mails begging for reviews as is common from other vendors."
2349,510539610,5,Very helpful post birth of my baby.
2350,510539610,3,"I don't know how to write a review for this product. I have issues with the DVD like other people have had (How do I contact you, seller?!). So far it's only been on the time efficient workout section right when the anatomy animation happens. I've only been through workout 1 and half of 2. I have yet to see if it skips on workout 3 and 4 and the time efficient workouts 2-4.

I do not have a quality review yet of the actual program and if it works yet, but I plan to update my review after a few weeks.

However, if you go to her website: hab-it.com and go to the ask Tasha section she is responsive, encouraging, and kind. That gives me hope in a hopeless situation."
2351,510539610,5,Good workout pelvic issues ..
2352,510539610,1,Returned; the DVD is defective.
2353,510539610,1,Open your package right away. Mine didn't have a DVD inside. I waited too long to check mine  and I couldn't return it.
2354,510539610,5,working great
2355,510539610,5,This video has really helped my glutes and lower back!
2356,510539610,5,"This is an amazing PT workout.  After being diagnosed with slight prolapse after the birth of my first child I started to do these workouts.  She explains each exercise thoroughly.  After a few weeks, my prolapse felt almost gone.  Then I got the stomach flu so didn't do these exercises for a week and the prolapse got noticeably worse again.  Anyways I  am now back to doing these exercises again.  I am sold on these and would recommend them to anyone postpartum, even somebody who doesn't have a diagnosed prolapse.  An extra bonus is that my husband absolutely loves how I hold myself using the posture this video not only explains but also strengthens the right muscles to enable you to hold during the day.  I have also tried a couple workout videos from Whole Woman and met with a WW representative, but in my opinion the workouts on this PT video are far superior.  This really is a good buy to have several PT workouts for less than the price of one PT appointment."
2357,510539610,5,"I've started the first workout and feel how my pelvic muscles work. I've been diagnosed with a mild bladder prolapse and hope to see results within weeks. So far, I liked the first workout."
2358,510539610,5,Anyone dealing with a prolapse NEEDS to get this movie. It seriously helped me
2359,510539610,5,Good program for pelvic floor strengthening!
2360,510539610,2,"The DVD was blank, unfortunately."
2361,510539610,1,"The material was probably good, but the DVD could not be maneuvered from segment to segment.  In other words, you could watch it all the way through, but if you wanted to focus on one of the segments and skip another, that could not be done.  I had others try the DVD on other DVD players with he same outcome.  Unfortunately, because of that, I returned the DVD."
2362,510539610,2,Maybe not.
2363,510539610,5,Definitely helped me with reducing my frequent urination when I utilize the exercises...even from day one!
2364,510539610,5,"I was having pelvic floor issues after a homebirth of my fifth child. I felt like my organs were falling out after I was standing only for 10 minutes or so. This completely fixed that feeing in less than a week! I did the entire program. I thought it was well explained, a good amount of time, and nicely progressive. I'm soooooo glad I purchased this."
2365,510539610,5,"I was devastated when I experienced a bladder prolapse after the birth of my baby.  My midwife recommended a costly physical therapist to correct the issues, and when one appointment cost me $200 I decided to give this a try first.  I stuck with exercise #1 and despite my best efforts only squeezed in the workouts about every three days.  However, it still worked!  After a few weeks my symptoms had almost entirely disappeared, and I was back to my favorite exercise of walking hills, now with a much more informed and capable ""basket.""  I enjoy the exercises so much (they simply feel good) I'm continuing on now, in my second month of doing them, and look forward to further results.  Highly recommended!"
2366,510539610,4,Good!
2367,510539610,4,"Works well, just wish I stuck with it more"
2368,510539610,5,Awesome explanations.  Easy to do.  Time efficient.  I absolutely hate to exercise and I've been able to stick to this so far for a few weeks.  I haven't completed the full 6 weeks yet which is when you are supposed to start seeing results.  I've seen a slight Improvement at the 2-week Mark.
2369,510539610,5,1 in 3 women need to do these excercises.
2370,510539610,3,"Really had high hopes after reading reviews for this; however, I have not seen an improvement after using for a few months. Giving 3 stars since things are not getting worse either. I do plan to continue to use this DVD since I am not seeing any worsening symptoms even though I remain very active and lift and carry my 3 year old who weighs 33 lbs."
2371,510539610,5,"Very helpful, excellent  !"
2372,510539610,5,"As I've become peri-menopausal I've experienced stress incontinence. This DVD reduced the symptoms after 4 weeks and has continued to be helpful to the point where I am not experiencing stress incontinence at all. An unexpected bonus-- my posture has improved a great deal as a result of this DVD because it exercises core muscles in addition to the pelvic floor. In general I've found the exercises good, although I am unable to do the squats in the workouts because of an ankle stability problem. (I've substituted wall squats instead.) I will continue with these exercises and am adding core exercises because they are very helpful in daily living."
2373,510539610,5,"Been using every day for 2 years. Love this product. Although doesn't make the prolapse better, great for strengthening your core.  Lots less pain at night when I do my exercises."
2374,510539610,5,Very organized exercise program to address pelvic floor issues.  The use for women is emphasized. I wonder if men can benefit from the exercises. Exercises are fairly brief (under a half hour) and totally doable by and almost 70-year-old. Thank you for a holistic approach.
2375,510539610,5,It helped with my moderate uterine prolapse.
2376,510539610,5,I found myself dealing with a prolapse 6 weeks postpartum with my fifth child. As a very active person I did not feel like this should be a controlling factor in my life and immediately began looking for some solutions. I quickly ruled out surgery as anything but a last resort since it seemed to have lots of risk and little return. So I decided to check into rehabilitation. That is when I cam across this DVD and promptly ordered it figuring it was way cheaper than doing PT in an office somewhere. I have now been doing these workouts for over 2 months and they have made a HUGE difference! I am now hopeful that by the time my baby is weaned I will be back to full speed. I have noticed Tasha has an advanced workout now out and I am hoping to get it at some point and maybe I will be able to return to running again!
2377,510539610,2,"This DVD is easy to understand and is highly recommended by reviewers.  However, I have to say after doing 3 of the sessions, I just could not take the boredom of it.  The exercises are fine, it is the instructor.  She says the exact same words every time.  And I was not motivated by the fact that she is dressed in street clothes. The whole thing felt odd and I have ordered another DVD."
2378,510539610,5,Well produced and helpful exercises. Found I saw results within just a few weeks.
2379,510539610,4,"The animations were helpful for understanding the musculature involved in the exercises, which made a big difference in how I was doing them and my success in strengthening my pelvic floor. I used this video regularly for a couple months. During the same time, I used pelvic weights. I think both were helpful and I met my goals. This video would benefit from an update. Also, the short version cut some transition time between exercises and was hard to keep up with, but the long version wasn't needed after the first couple times through."
2380,510539610,5,I've been doing the workout for about a month and I'm already noticing results and I'm only on workout one. The education given on anatomy and how you need more than just kegels to strengthen your pelvic floor and get improved continence is really helpful. I'm very happy with the program.
2381,510539610,5,"I bought the digital download ($13) from the hab-it website.  (I did not receive any discounts or promotions.) I have three children and was having some pretty severe issues after the third birth.  Wow, I wish I had known about it before!  Would totally buy again; cheaper than one PT session! Great, progressive PT exercises.  After 2 months of doing them about 5 times a week it has made a huge difference with my 'undercarriage' problems, which were getting pretty bad and which are now about 90% better.  It also helped the small amount of abdominal separation I had from the pregnancy!

Definitely watch the intros at least once; they help make the exercises more effective.  I find that a small portion of my bedroom floor (or even the bed) and an inexpensive child's ball are sufficient for most exercises.  It does take about 29 minutes to go through each routine, but it's worth it."
2382,510539610,5,This is a well done CD and I recommend it.
2383,510539610,1,"The exercises appear to be great but the DVD is NOT closed captioned! As a hearing impaired consumer, I am extremely disappointed that it isn't captioned. I have my t.v. volume up almost all the way and am still having a hard time understanding the instructions. Please, be decent and caption the thing!"
2384,510539610,4,I would have given it 5 stars if the quality of the actual video had been better.  I am hopeful that this video will help strengthen my pelvic wall and help my uterine prolapse. I will write more as I continue to us it as to whether it helps or not.
2385,510539610,5,Excellent
2386,510539610,4,So far so good!
2387,510539610,5,"This is a fantastic program! I injured my low back several years ago ruptured two discs and ended up with nerve roots contacted on both sides of my spine. As a result I have dealt with terrible sciatica down both legs and pelvic floor dysfunction as a result of the lack of movement in my pelvic region. Having worked with professional physical therapists with little success, I had almost given up hope of ever regaining function in my low back and pelvic floor. From the first time I pressed play and went through the workout I could feel a huge difference. The functional approach to the entire pelvic floor and supporting muscles was exactly what I needed. For the first time in years I have hope that my condition has and will continue to improve and consequently grant me better functionality and pain relief. If you aren't sure about this purchase I can tell you there's nothing to lose and everything to gain by trying this program. Your body will thank you and your work will reward you with a better quality of life."
2388,510539610,5,"I started seeing results from this program after the second workout. It's easy to follow, doesn't take a big time commitment, and does exactly what it says. I recommend it to anyone struggling with pelvic floor issues. Great program!"
2389,510539610,5,Superb!  Just need to use it regularly.
2390,510539610,2,"If you have already been to a pelvic physical therapist then this is not for you. I would say this is strictly for beginners, but even still I didn't think there was much substance to this video."
2391,510539610,5,I went to physical therapy for pelvic floor help after having my first baby.  This video is pretty much exactly what they taught me!  I highly recommend this postpartum.  Especially since its hard to get out of the house with a new baby.
2392,510539610,3,"Ok but not easy to follow , haven't noticed a big difference"
2393,510539610,5,Have only used it for about 2 weeks now.  I was a physical therapist prior to going to medical school and I think the exercises are on point. Looking forward to progressing through the exercses and hopefully gaining some better pelvic floor control!
2394,510539610,5,This video is so great!  The graphics help me visualize the muscles involved and her instructions are excellent.
2395,510539610,5,"Excellent instruction and explanation. I did have a little difficulty with the DVD sticking but cleaned it twice and so far so good. Most Physical Therapist I have worked with start on the ""core"", which is good but I have found that for me this is the place to start. It seems to be at the very root of the problem. I am very appreciative of Tasha's excellent demonstrations and counting out loud reminders as to when  to squeeze so you don't have to try and watch the exercise while you are doing it once you are familiar with the process.  It is also broken up into workouts which is good so you learn one work out and when you are ready move on."
2396,510539610,5,Highly recommend this!
2397,510539610,5,"Love this, wish I had found it earlier.  Only been working out with it daily for a few days but already see results.  Easy to follow workout, very instructional and the instructor is great.  Thank you."
2398,510539610,5,"I purchased after doing a lot of research after finding out I had prolapsed bladder.

This has been in my opinion one of the most clear and sensible exercise videos for prolapse.

After being diagnosed I was depressed and didn't know what to do but then I got over it and did my homework and came across this.

My biggest problem is my own. Taking time.  When I am regular in my exercise I feel better and stronger and notice I pay attention to my posture and doing kegels on my own.

Tasha is very clear and caring. I highly recommend this dvd!"
2399,510539610,5,"I am fairly young (22) and after having my son 3.5 years ago I had a slight uterine prolapse. It was uncomfortable and I was worried it would get worse. Doctor told me my only real option was having the mesh put in or a hysterectomy when I was older, as I was still too young. I want more kids in the future, so that really was not an option.

This DVD starts slow, and you think these workouts really do nothing, but after just a week of use I could tell the difference! I have never been more grateful for a purchase than this one. I went from not being able to workout without discomfort, to not even remembering I had the issue. My gynecologist was actually surprised to realize things were holding up better without surgery."
2400,510539610,4,Great
2401,510539610,5,It has been very helpful. Highly recommended!
2402,510539610,4,This helped me understand the benefits
2403,510539610,5,Excellent DVD and resource for postpartum prolapse! Highly recommend!
2404,510539610,5,"I've only watched this once, but it seems easy enough. Wish I had more input on if it works."
2405,510539610,5,"This is a great video. Using this along with the IntiFit kegel exercise kit has given me total relieve. I'm very grateful that I found this video. I had stage 2 bladder prolapse, doctors told me just have more sex, at 65 I'd rather do laundry, and  besides you'd have to it everyday. They just make you feel that your old and useless. Which I'm not, I'm active, live on a hobby farm and I'm in great shape. Now I can do even more since I don't have to go to the bathroom all the time."
2406,510539610,5,"Well worth the money and more. I currently go to physical therapy as referred by my OB due to pelvic organ prolapse (after having my second child). My PT only tells me to do kegels, but I told her about Han-it and she says that I should keep doing the Hab-it videos if I have them. Strengthening the core is known to help strengthen the pelvic floor (many articles and women's magazines recommend similar exercises that Tasha Mulligan includes in her DVD).  I have been doing this DVD for 6 weeks (haven't skipped one day) and I feel a lot better. She says you can do every other day, but I had time due to maternity leave so I wanted to do as much as possible to improve faster. Just don't overdo the kegel portion.

Tips:
Go to her website Hab-it.com.
1. She has the videos in downloadable format to put in your phone. I didn't see this till later. Alternatively you can download a program like handbrake for your computer to convert DVD to QuickTime video to put on your phone, which I did. This gave me no excuses. I also screenshotted the exercises and saved them on my phone so by the time I did these exercises for weeks I only needed to see the screenshot and not open the video to prompt me to do the exercises.
2. She has a 7-day advanced workout so if these 4 workouts are getting too easy or you plateaued, buy the advanced workout! It's more variety, longer, and really kicks your butt. I bought this after I was doing all 4 exercises everyday and it was getting boring and long.

A nice side effect of these exercises is I'm more toned and lost some weight too! I still have some prolapse but my PT says it feels a lot less and my kegels are stronger too. This is an amazing program."
2407,510539610,5,"Great dvd for those of us with bladder problems.  I'm 72 and started having problems while sneezing, coughing.
Exercises are very easy to perform and really do help.  My doctor says she wishes more women would turn to the
kegel exercises before the situation gets any more serious."
2408,510539610,5,Best DVD for pelvic floor safe exercise.  Post-prolapse surgery safe as well.
2409,510539610,5,My mom bought this about 6 weeks ago and has shown significant improvement in bladder control.  She convince me to buy it and now I'm getting results myself.
2410,510539610,4,So far so good.......I'll write more later when I have done the exercises longer.......
2411,510539610,3,I found the exercises took a lot of my time and space. I live in a small home with no room to do the exercise and do not have the amount of time this needs to be beneficial. I go to the gym three days a week but cannot lug my computer there to do the exercises. Would be nice if it came with an app also
2412,510539610,5,The best program I have seen. Better than PT.
2413,510539610,3,could have been more to it
2414,510539610,3,"I think the information on this video is very good and I look forward to using it; however, it's a pain to get the info.  The video starts midway thru.  It doesn't just play smoothly like it should.  The good news is that the creator of the exercises actually walks you through the whole thing which is very helpful.  I wish I'd gotten a copy that works so I could just pop it in and follow along without using a remote to select what I want to see.  Otherwise, great product."
2415,510539610,5,"Consistency is the key, try and make it part of daily routine, like brushing teeth and the benefits will speak for themselves"
2416,510539610,5,Love this. My midwife recommended it for my moderate pelvic organ prolapse and rectus abdominis. Doing this 4x weekly has done AMAZING things for how I feel and look.
2417,510539610,5,"Fred's wife here...  So 4 weeks after having a beautiful 8.5lb baby boy, it was very apparent that I had a prolapsed bladder :(  I had 2 weeks to go before my first postnatal Dr's appointment but I didn't need him to tell me what was already obvious. So I started to do some research and came across the Hab It DVD. Ladies, it is well worth the $20 or $30. I started  doing the Hab It video at 5 weeks postpartum 5x per week and within 3 weeks I could tell it was already improving.  I couldn't get a pelvic floor physical therapy appointment ( which my OB/GYN prescribed) until 2 months after my 6 week appointment and I'm so happy I had this dvd.  It goes beyond just kegel exercises and will help your core in general  get stronger.  My baby is 5 months old now and my bladder prolapse is still there but soooo much better. I'm pretty confident by the time he's a year old I will rarely think about it. If you any sort of pelvic floor issues don't ignore them! You must work to make them get better. This dvd is absolutely great. I now do it only 2-3 x per week."
2418,510539610,4,"Not the most well-filmed workout video, but it's clear and it works! Which is really all that's important after giving birth to 2 babies."
2419,510539610,5,"Very satisfied with this DVD. The information and instructions are very thorough. It comes with four different workouts and also time efficient workouts that skips the detailed instructions once you know how to do the exercises. I would recommend this to anyone for before, during and after pregnancy."
2420,510539610,4,"I have a question-would this be helpful for a child with a bed wetting problem?  Sorry for asking a question in the review section, but there isn't a place for questions.  I did purchase this to help with prolapse.  While I just started using it, I can't say about results yet, but it is easy to use and very well guided and set up.  It has 4 separate workouts, you build up to each level.  I think it is helping so far."
2421,510539610,3,"Was good for my mother, nevertheless it doesn't have spanish subtitles. I believe for the advanced prolapse cases it is not recommended."
2422,510539610,4,"Simple but great video. Was very helpful to me in dealing with a prolapse issue. I like the feature whereas you can play a version of the exercises with complete instructions or you can choose to play a streamlined version without the longer explanations when you have become familiar with the routines. I do agree that this video should be  promoted by OB-GYNs - being told to ""go home and do Kegels"" just doesn't cut it."
2423,510539610,5,Better than exercises my Doctor gave me.
2424,510539610,5,"excellent step by step workout, difference felt after 2 weeks and getting better by the day"
2425,510539610,5,"amazing! you have to get it even if you don't suffer from the embarrassing symptoms of prolapse. after two days doing this, my problems disappeared. I was very skeptical of it since I'm  very active and other product didn't worked."
2426,510539610,5,"This was a lifesaver for me. After the birth of my second child I felt great and was very excited to get back to running after about 4 weeks because I had stayed fit/run throughout pregnancy and was itching to get back into my old routine. I went for a short run and felt something 'shift'. I ended up with a uterine prolapse, 2nd/3rd degree. Upon searching the internet and talking to my OB I was completely devastated. I was a D1 college track and cross country athlete and running is a defining part of my life...I was told from all angles that I was never going to run again and the only resolution was going to be surgery after being done having kids. I went through a couple of months very depressed, mean and just overall miserable. After a fellow mom mentioned this DVD I decided to give it a try. After a month of doing the DVD every other day I added in some weight training and really focused on building my core, hip flexor and and lower back muscles. In late January I started to run again, starting with a qtr of a mile at a time and raised the distance by a qtr of a mile each week. I just ran a half marathon a week ago at 8 months postpartum and am back to running like my old self.  I highly encourage anybody dealing with prolapse or any other pelvic floor issues to try this DVD before agreeing to any surgery...mine is completely gone and for that I am so grateful."
2427,510539610,5,I have been doing the exercises and am seeing results. Thanks.
2428,510539610,5,"This has helped so much, I can really feel the difference if I don't keep it up. Will use these exercising for life!"
2429,510539610,4,"I am very happy to have found instruction that is both very informative, helpful and concise. I hope these exercises will help me regain my what is lost at the moment. I wish I had come across this much earlier.....like before surgery which did not help at all."
2430,510539610,5,Excellent. The instructor is very knowledgable and easy to follow.
2431,510539610,5,Totally awesome and on the mark amazing!
2432,510539610,5,Received on time.  Have been using for about three weeks and so far am very happy with the disc.  It will take time to know if it actually helps with the problem.
2433,510539610,5,"These simple exercises are excellent.  Not only do they help with prolapse, but they give you back your waist, flatten your stomach, and firm your behind, whether you are recovering from pregnancy or out of shape or a senior you will be very pleased with the results.  I would love to have an overall work out program from Tasha!  Never have I seen such results from exercise."
2434,510539610,5,"I am amazed at the results I saw the first two weeks of just doing workout 1.  This is so life changing!  Working on my fourth week, starting workout 2 today.  I wish I had found this DVD years ago!  I have a bad back, so will alternate workout 1 and 2 this week.  Working on this 6 days a week has made such an impact on my quality of life, I am so thankful!"
2435,510539610,5,Love this! Has helped my strength & pelvic floor
2436,510539610,5,wow best pelvic floor excersise.
2437,510539610,5,"Easy to follow comprehensive exercise for pelvic floor exercise and posture, this DVD has become part of my regular routine, well done Tasha Mulligan."
2438,510539610,5,"This dvd is a must have for every woman with any kind of prolapse. I have a bladder prolapse after the birth of my son. He is now two years old. Kegel excercises are very well explained. I would just add one good advice with this workout- go for jogging. Get your body in a corect posture where you won't be feeling your prolapse and start jogging. Trust me, you will feel great and your abdominal muscles will start fixing your pelvic floor. As well, your weight will be better, thats what bothers your lower muscles. Great dvd, fast shipping to Greece. Good luck everyone, head up, loose weight and try to find one hour for yourself per day."
2439,510539610,1,Actual content great but quality of disk crap during the whole intro and technique section there are many parts that it goes black no picture you can only hear.
2440,510539610,2,I just started the exercises about a week ago.  I plan to try it for 6 weeks to see if my pelvic floor is tightened.  The exercises are easy and she explains things well.
2441,510539610,5,great dvd
2442,510539610,5,"i have to admit i have not watched/used it yet.  but i have been in physical therapy for 3 months now (for my pelvic floor) and it is working great.  i bought this and let my pt watch it - she said it is a great video to use.  but a warning from me - going to a pt gives you specific feedback on what you need to fix vs. a video that can't tell you what your real issues are.  there were many things that i thought were fine with my body that weren't and vice versa.  THIS CAN'T REPLACE A REAL PT. i am going to use this after i am discharged to keep up my exercises.  My advice it to see a PT first, then use this to reinforce your treatment."
2443,510539610,5,It really helps me a lot. Thanks
2444,510539610,5,As advertised.  Came early!
2445,510539610,5,Absolutely a must buy.
2446,510539610,5,Exercises are great--3 levels to get up to. Loving this so far.
2447,510539610,5,"Excellent DVD to help new/old moms get their bodies back better than ever.
Slow and sure exercises.
Excellent instruction."
2448,510539610,5,Every woman should know this information
2449,510539610,5,"I intended to purchase a pelvic floor  DVD by Julie Wiebe after attending a course of hers for physical therapy professionals when I discovered this DVD by Tasha Mulligan. The reviews on this DVD inspired me to purchase it. It is great! I work as a physical therapist assistant and I have incorporated several of the exercises from this DVD into my treatment plans. I do the exercises myself and I recommend this DVD to anyone and everyone regardless of whether you are experiencing pelvic floor dysfunction or not. All women can benefit from the information and exercises presented in this DVD. Thanks for sharing your knowledge, Tasha Mulligan."
2450,510539610,4,Liked the program.
2451,510539610,4,"Not used by me...but, I hear its a great tool."
2452,510539610,2,Video and sound quality are terrible
2453,510539610,2,"The DVD does not work on my DVD player or laptop without skipping or getting a jumbled picture. My DVD player and laptop play all other DVD's just fine. This DVD seems like it is low quality. I like what I see in Tasha's video, but I don't have the patience for the DVD issues. Deciding how best to handle this, return the DVD or get a replacement. I am doubtful a replacement will resolve the issue."
2454,510539610,5,Dear friends. I'm planning to buy this for my friend out side of US. She only can understand the written English. So could anyone who bought this know whether there is the text coming with the conversation on the screen at the same time. Thanks so so much.
2455,510539610,5,"This DVD has helped me so much! I can already tell a difference. It makes me feel more in control, when I thought all control was lost! Pelvic Prolapse diagnosis? Buy it! Use it!"
2456,510539610,5,Fantastic resource for anyone with pelvic floor weakness or prolapse.
2457,510539610,5,This really is a great DVD as it addresses muscles other than pelvic floor which affect pelvic floor disfunction. Also does a good job in explaining. Easy to follow.
2458,510539610,5,Very well presented and easy to follow.
2459,510539610,5,"Very good dvd.  Really great exercises to strenghthen your pelvic floor.  Ladies, this is important information."
2460,510539610,5,Very clear and precise exercise's
2461,510539610,5,It's all on video.  No misunderstanding what is being told in a book.  Just watch and do the exercises right along with host.  Worth every penny.
2462,510539610,5,Excellent!!  This will help you!!
2463,510539610,5,I love this video and exercise program. The instructor is easy to understand and follow. It doesn't take long and it has helped!
2464,510539610,5,"arrived on time, as advertised"
2465,510539610,5,Every woman needs this!
2466,510539610,5,"I had a hysterectomy a year ago at age 60. I have always been an active woman, taking vitamins, exercising and eating a healthy diet. Three months ago I noticed that I was not paying as much attention to my pelvic floor or core muscles,as I should have been all these years. I ordered this DVD and started using it right away. The results have been wonderful,my pelvic floor has gotten stronger,I noticed a difference in the first week. I plan to continue these exercises. Tasha Mulligan's instruction is top notch,she explains all the reasons why we need a strong pelvic floor and core,she also gives good instruction on how we can tell if we are in the proper posture stance. I wish I had started these exercises at a younger age,but better late than never. I would highly suggest that all women get this DVD,it's that good. Thank you,Tasha!"
2467,510539610,5,I've been doing this video for three weeks and I've noticed results that have made life easier for me.  I feel much more control and less pain which I wasn't expecting it to help at all.  It's really easy to learn the exercises too.  I'm extremely happy I bought this DVD and will continue to use and reap the benefits!
2468,510539610,3,"I have received my third DVD from Amazon.  I explained to reps from Amazon that the first 2 DVD's they replaced were defective.  The defect is in the same place on each DVD.  Even the quality of the 3rd DVD (the one I kept) is not good but I kept it because I want to get on with my exercises!  The problem is the first part of the DVD (specifically, Workout 1)  skips or delays then slowly moves to the next part.--NOT HELPFULL when trying to exercise !  The content of the DVD is great.  Just need better quality of physical material of DVD."
2469,510539610,5,Actually works and so much less expensive than the 200 dollar physical therapy sessions that my doctor referred me for. And the exercises are either the same or very similar to what my therapist had me doing.  I'd love to see another dvd with more exercise options.
2470,510539610,5,"AMAZING.  If you suffer from pelvic floor dysfunction, this woman and her videos should be your new best friends.  You have to remain diligent, but it is worth it.  I cried through my first two workouts due to embarrassment and sadness at needing these workouts.  However, I quickly got over it and I quickly saw results in pain reduction and lessening of urgency.  These workouts are easy to follow, demonstrated perfectly, and you are encouraged throughout in a soft-spoken, encouraging voice.  Training your pelvic floor is tricky and awkward, but it is worth remaining true to!!  Interstitial Cystitis or PFD sufferers--this must be a staple in your recovery.  I can't wait to purchase the 6-pack workout video Mulligan recommends!!  The only gripe I have with the video is that I am potentially barren and the narrator mentions a ""bundle of joy"" or ""your little one"" as encouragement or reward for finishing a workout (or even for having PFD, which I'm sure a lot of you moms out there feel that way--but I may never be one).  Some of us have PFD without the joys (or results) of motherhood, and these comments made me feel even more isolated.  Whatever, I got over it, this workout is amazing and I obviously thought those few comments were worth ignoring.  Buy the tape."
2471,510539610,5,This dvd is great for strengthening the core muscles! I've been using it for a few weeks and can notice a difference already. I would highly recommend this to any lady of any age. It is geared to getting those muscles in shape regardless of age or circumstance.
2472,510539610,5,I noticed a benefit from exercises after a week. Also exercises are not difficult to do.  I can even do them throughout the day
2473,510539610,5,It Really works!!!  After one week I could tell the difference.
2474,510539610,5,Holy cow! I just found out I've been sitting wrong all my life. I feel a difference after the first workout which was hardly a workout. Amazing. I will follow up with more after a few weeks.
2475,510539610,5,"I'm not even 30, but have had stress incontinence since a young age.  I had heard you pee your pants when jumping after bearing children, so why was that happening to me at age 16?  I always heard, 'do your kegels' but never felt I understood how.  Like how often and in what position and how many.  I didn't feel I knew if I was doing them correctly or even remembered to do them.  12 years and 2 kids later, I'm having a lot of pelvic pain and can't even use tampons because they just don't fit right anymore.
I have researched a bit into vaginal weights, but always get overwhelmed and then stop shopping.  One day when talking to a friend, I finally decided I had to buckle down and order something.  I about cried when someone said in a review for weights that they didn't work with a prolapse.  It describes the symptoms I had with tampons and said a doctor may not mention a minor prolapse.  I had thought things just weren't quite right in there.  But what to do now?  I kept seeing this stupid dvd for sale and thought, ""no! I need equipment"".  When I finally read reviews, I felt hopeful and knew I needed to try it.
I've not been perfect about using it, but have been pretty decent.  And even if I haven't made it through an entire workout, once in bed, I actually remember to do kegels and feel like I can actually do them.  I apparently needed to be walked through it the way this lady does it.  And the visuals really help.  Yes it gets annoying to listen to.  But I just listen to something else and watch for cues.
I feel that things are changing and I haven't had the pelvic pain!  I'm hopeful that things will continue to improve as I continue with the program.  Yes, it just may be worth your money to buy a stupid dvd.  Think if it as physical therapy, because it is.  For someone with less problems than I have, other options may be best,  but if you have very little pelvic floor strength,  this is a great place to start!"
2476,510539610,5,This video saved me!!! After having a 9lb baby 4th degree lacerations I was having a hard road to recovery!! I recommend this video to anyone especially postpartum moms
2477,510539610,5,"This works amazingly for postpartum help down yonder.  Easy exercise but specifically targeted and effective.  If you are suffering from incontinence, do yourself a favor and order this (and stick to it!)"
2478,510539610,5,Great! Really works!
2479,510539610,4,I hope this helps me It  seems like it is working  I like doing the tape she explained pretty clear so u understand!!
2480,510539610,5,This is the best collection of pelvic floor exercises that I have ever seen. It takes just a few minutes a day and goes far beyond the simple kegel exercises. I would highly recommend it.
2481,510539610,1,"Incomplete merchandise, didn't have rubber excersise aid included."
2482,510539610,5,"Easy work out, shipped fast!"
2483,510539610,5,I am amazed by the results! After 6 weeks of using this DVD my incontinence has improved dramatically. For the cost of less than one co-pay for physical therapy I have been able to do a complete physical therapy program in my own home. Kegels didn't work for me but this did. An added bonus is that my lower back is feeling better too! I highly recommend this DVD.
2484,510539610,5,"Targets muscles you didn't know were there, and wouldn't know how to work if you did. I don't use it regularly enough, but I can tell from the little time that I have that it is doing the job even without doing it as much as I should."
2485,510539610,5,"Please try this BEFORE agreeing to any surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) or stress urinary incontinence (SUI). At age 40, after having four children, I was very active walking, running, biking, rollerblading. But all of that exercise apparently didn't do much for my pelvic floor. I had a level 3 bladder prolapse, was talked into surgery using a transvaginal mesh bladder sling (Yep, the kind you see on the lawyer commercials on tv). Long story short, that was 4 years ago. I was one of the 15% of women who have severe complications from mesh surgeries. The mesh eroded through my vagina, urethra, caused severe nerve and muscle damage, and ultimately had to be removed surgically. After 7 surgeries to try to deal with all the problems this mesh caused, I am now disabled, living in chronic severe vaginal/pelvic pain, unable to sit at all, and unable to work anymore. And guess what? I still leak when I cough & sneeze after all of that! So please, please try this before you consider surgery. I'm using this DVD now to try to get some strength back in my pelvic floor, but it is too late for me - the damage is done. I don't want any more women to suffer."
2486,510539610,5,"Easy to follow program, only 15 minutes, well explained strengthening exercises led by a physical therapist."
2487,510539610,5,Excellent. Had improvement after the first workout. Great to have a resource that really works and you can do in your own home.
2488,510539610,4,very important exercises are presented here. not just kegel but other such as squats. i think in general these are great to do on a regular basis.
2489,510539610,5,Great DVD. I highly recommend it. I can really feel a difference. The exercises and her directions are great. Thanks Tasha.
2490,510539610,5,Excellent exercises that have made a huge difference!
2491,510539610,3,"still not into this after watching once! Just do Kagels when I think of it! Am 57, started symptoms at menopause! Don't understand WHY!
Only had ONE child, C section! Carried low the whole time and could never go to bathroom! Still, am 4 11"" always small! Weight yo yo
All my life 90/110! Gained 50 POUNDS WHEN PREGNANT, MOSTLY WATER, GD DURING PREGNANCY SO ON STRICT DIET!
I think what caused problems/RUNNING FOR YEARS, WEIGHTS WHILE EXERCISING! I recommend all women wear a support belt while pregnant! No ONE EVER TOLD ME THIS COULD HAPPEN TO OUR BODY! So when Dr. Said I had this I was shocked!
So FAR refused Surgery! What has helped is two green drinks EVERY DAY! Plus 3 FIBER MATE TABLETS! Use a bench for feet in bathroom! Never let myself get constipated! Breath to go to bathroom/NO FORCE! Never thought I would write this but I hate reading What has happened to hundreds of women who had surgery! Would Never have! Also, use bio hormones! Afraid of estrogen cream but use occasionally! Don't want Cancer! NO RUNNING! NO WEIGHTS! NO HEAVY LIFTING! Walk and elyptical! Am afraid of sex but give in once in a while so husband doesn't divorce me! Need to lose ten or fifteen pounds but haven't been able to! My whole life could only lose weight running Weights and fasting! Will try this video more after reading reviews! Am still very depressed about the future of this FRIKIN NIGHTMARE! I don't leak or have pain etc. one women Doctor said DONT HAVE SURGERY, HERS IS WORSE AND SHE LIVES WITH IT! Had the flu a few days and after throwing up for days it caused severe lower back pain, bleeding! And now feels like I urinate in the wrong place! Am going to keep reading what other people do! After the mesh stories I cannot see giving in to such a nightmare! God bless ALL YOU WOMEN! Tell young women to do these exercises all there life and wear support belt when pregnant! Wish someone would have told me!  Another thought for MOMS! I carried my daughter around all the time because she didn't have DAD! She had legs rapped around my waste above my hips! Did this until probably five! Was a muscular child, not fat, but big boned and heavy frame, all muscle! I NOW think all the pressure from holding her like this a lot might have contributed big time! So ""STUPID"" THAT I never thought holding her would hurt me!
God bless you all! Sincerely"
2492,510539610,5,This video is life changing for me.  I do not have prolapse but bought to improve pelvic floor health.  I feel it has changed my life in the first viewing.  The information on posture alone was worth more than the cost of the video.  It sounds cliche but I only wish I had found/bought it sooner.
2493,510539610,5,"This DVD has been great.  After having three kids, I had to get my body back into running shape.  My issue was not incontinence but pressure/organ prolapse when I would run and do high impact exercises.  I went to a pelvic floor physical therapist but this video is what I needed to get me to actually perform the exercises at home,  I do them 3-4 times a week and I credit Hab-it for helping me return to running after having kids."
2494,510539610,4,"The exercises are pretty basic and easy for anyone who is already active. However, I just skipped to level 4 exercises.  The concept of strengthening all the muscles around your pelvis and hips is great.  The way she describes your pelvic floor as a basket is also great.  It really helps target the correct muscles.  I noticed after just a week or two of doing the exercises a difference.  I would recommend this to any woman."
2495,510539610,5,"I like the different levels from beginner to advanced.
(I wish I could have found it some place besides Amazon)"
2496,510539610,5,This is like having your physical therapy session in the privacy of your home.  Excellent instruction.  Beneficial to almost every woman.
2497,510539610,5,This is a miracle cure and has changed my life!!  I had stress incontinence and was feeling miserable about it.  Kegals weren't doing the trick so I bought this DVD.  I haven't had a leak since starting the first routine!  I followed the first workout until I knew the instructions and am now doing the quick version of the first workout.  I love how I can do it when I wake up in the morning and am tired because it isn't strenuous.  Mostly I love how it works!!  I will keep doing this workout at least 3 times a week forever!
2498,510539610,4,This dvd is really great. The explanation of the exercises is clear and precise and easy to follow. Although I have only used it for 2 weeks I definitely can feel some improvements!
2499,510539610,5,"This is awesome for working all the deep pelvic and abdominal muscles, plus all connecting/supporting muscles. Hoping Dr. Mulligan will make another updated version with more exercises!"
2500,510539610,3,working with this video.  Takes patience and a lot of time to do all exercises.  Had some helpful hints.  Time will tell
2501,510539610,5,So far I have only did the 1st exercise. The exercise have helped I will continue to do them and move to the next. The instructor is very long and drawn out but I understand she wants to educate and make sure the exercise is done correctly.
2502,510539610,2,"I bought this dvd for postpartum incontinence and diligently did the workouts for about 4 weeks. I saw some improvement but it was very small and I still had moderate incontinence issues. I bought the XFT iEase also available on amazon

http://www.amazon.com/Calliger-Pelvic-Exerciser-On-Screen-Biofeedback/dp/B00H5GDO4Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1407339566&sr=8-1&keywords=iease

This thing is amazing. I can actually see on the screen how strong my muscles are contracting when I do a kegel exercise. I had no idea how weak my muscles really were but this machine measures your strength and ranks you according to levels. I started at level 2 (weak muscles) and am rapidly improving because I can SEE how much I need to push myself. With this Hab It dvd, I thought I was working hard but never really knew where I was at so I didn't push myself even though I thought I was. If you truly want to regain muscle control, go with the XFT iEase. It's a but more pricey but is SO worth it. I'd pay a lot more now that I know it works."
2503,510539610,2,This DVD is poorly designed in it lay out of the exercises.  It is hard to get from one exercise section to another. The speaker talks too much and is too repetitive. She is very irritating to listen to over a long period of time.  DVD was produced a long time ago and has never been updated.  Needs updating badly.  It is also overpriced for what few exercise you get.  Would not recommend it to anyone and wish I had not purchased it.  There has to be something better out there for strengthening pelvic floor muscles
2504,510539610,5,This is a great instructional way to use exercises for the kegal muscle. I recommend to anyone who needs to do this.
2505,510539610,1,"It seemed great until I found out that the physical DVD media was of very poor quality and there are parts that freeze and skip no matter what I try.

This only happens with some portions of the DVD, and I only discovered the problem after the refund policy expired, so Amazon refuses to refund my money. A bad experience all around."
2506,510539610,5,This is one of the best instructional videos i've seen in a long time. the instructor is really clear and just gets down to business. It's easy to use and very helpful. Highly recommend.
2507,510539610,5,"I have used this now for a few months and have found it helpful.  I already knew that I was having problems with a nervous bladder, but when I experienced a prolapse, I was frightened.  After doing some research, I found that prior to any surgery or other medical things, a round of physical therapy would be ordered. I decided I'd rather do this in the privacy and comfort of my own home. Tasha Mulligan is a PT and specialized in this area. The anatomy and explanations are well done and well presented for visualization. This was important - and helpful - to me. Also helpful, is the quiet, matter of fact voice, the pace of the workouts, and her counting. I can't count, concentrate and exercise at the same time - I need someone else counting!  It took a full month of using this on the FIRST set of workouts, before I could slightly feel the muscles move.  It was in the second month that I began noticing the improvement of bladder issues, with the other nice side effect of seeing a slightly thinner waist and stomach muscles. The third month, the prolapse was not bothering me.  I have followed up with my OBGYN who let me know I was doing the right thing and encouraged me to keep it up.  I'm still only doing the first and part of the second sets of workouts.  I am well-pleased with the results and grateful that Tasha Mulligan put it out."
2508,510539610,5,"Better than any mechanical device your ob-gyn might prescribe.  It gets to the cause of the problem and corrects it.  You do need to do the exercises regularly, but better than yucky devices or surgery."
2509,510539610,5,"I recently had surgery for pelvic organ prolapse. I wanted to be sure that I am doing whatever I can to prevent further problems. I purchased the DVD during the period of physical therapy for PF. The PT asked if she could review it before I started so that she could be sure that things were done properly and would not hurt my repairs.

When she returned the DVD the following week, she gave it a thumbs up! She said that it contains so many of the PF exercises that she does with her patients and recommended that I use it 3 times a week."
2510,510539610,4,This dvd does a good job of explaining how to do exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor and it has more exercises than I have found in most other programs.
2511,510539610,5,"I didn't really realize/acknowledge I was having pelvic floor issues until after I started these workouts.  Before completing the workouts the 2nd time I was no longer experiencing any urinary incontinence, which, while minor enough to ignore in the first place, is sure nice to be without!

An even larger benefit was when I realized the hip strengthening exercises virtually cured a decade old IT-band injury.  I'm running a reasonable number of miles again for the first time since college!

The workouts are competed quickly and Tasha's cuing is timely and keeps the exercises efficient and effective.  I recommend this to all my mommy friends!"
2512,510539610,5,"After 4 weeks of doing the exercises every other day, I am already noticing huge core tone differences.  I am no longer afraid to sneeze."
2513,510539610,5,Love the video !  The instructor is very knowledgeable about the Prolapse Pelvic Floor. This exercise is gives you a safe and effective workout.
2514,510539610,5,"My husband ordered this for me and I began Kegal's while waiting on shipment. One and a half weeks ago I began Hab it, doing the exercises daily. I am virtually pain free at this time. The pain before was ruining my life. The burning was horrific. I am amazed and Incredibly grateful. I can cough, sneeze, and laugh and stay dry already, even after years of being this way! It was the pain however that drove me to action. The reviews speak for themselves. I can't imagine living the way it was! Praise God it is over!!!!!"
2515,510539610,5,"My doctor sent me to PT and I didn't find it very helpful, but I found this great...exercises were easy to follow.  The instructor has a mildly annoying accent that comes through at times but I'll take it for the otherwise good instruction and easy to follow work outs....and it seems to be helping a lot!"
2516,510539610,5,"This video series is fantastic for those of us who have to do exercises.  The guidelines are easy to use.  I saw results within a week of doing the 15 minute exercise routine daily.  And then of course, there are added benefits, sexual benefits...but I'll keep it PG clean here.  :)  Definitely worth it."
2517,510539610,5,"Easy to follow, easy to do exercises that improve the quality of your life. You can do the exercises any where any time."
2518,510539610,5,"Very easy to follow CD, great graphics which explain what you are doing and it works. I play the CD daily and use their different exercises.."
2519,510539610,5,"Recently I noticed that my mild pelvic prolapse had been getting worse and had progressed to moderate to severe. I am middle aged, and menopausal. After researching I found that pelvic floor exercises can sometimes help keep the problem from getting any worse. I was skeptical to say the least but wanted to keep surgery as a last resort option only. I purchased the dvd and went to work. I was surprised how I felt some soreness in some of the muscles the next day, the exercises seemed so simple! It was obvious that I had not been using those muscles much in my everyday life. I have been doing the exercises for about 6 weeks now and I am currently on the 3rd set of workouts. All I can say is wow! I can really feel a difference. It has not cured the prolapse but the symptoms are really and truly, honest to God better! I can actually feel the difference and am much more comfortable. For you ladies who suffer from prolapse you will understand what I mean when I say things are ""riding higher""  in there. I am so glad I did not let my skepticism keep me from trying this. It has made such a big difference in how I feel. A huge Thank-you to Tasha for putting this work out together."
2520,510539610,5,"I have seen amazing results already in just a few short weeks and I don't even do it as often as I should.  I used to work in an ob/gyn office with 9 physicians and I can tell you this surpasses anything I have ever seen recommended.  Have seen patients have some major complications from surgery.  Please give this a try , you won't be disappointed."
2521,510539610,5,Excellent.  If you have prolapse this is a very good DVD.  I have much better pelvic floor strength after only 3 weeks.
2522,510539610,5,"I haven't done this video as consistently as I should or would like, but I notice when I do it, I definitely feel a lot stronger ""down there"". There is a huge difference when I don't do it. Definitely recommend!"
2523,510539610,5,"The author is right, this information is not talked about enough. Yet all women could benefit from doing these exercises.  Tasha makes it very easy for anyone to follow along and stay engaged.  There are different length sessions too so it's easy to fit into your schedule whenever you have a few moments to yourself.

I am only on the second day of this program but feel it is already helping me isolate otherwise ignored muscles of the pelvic floor.  I plan to continue this for the duration and will post again afterwards.

Best wishes to anyone reading this review.  If you feel like you could benefit, you probably can."
2524,510539610,5,"I haven't been using the program very long, but even after the first viewing and test run I could feel a difference in my muscles.  I actually woke up sore the next day even after just doing a simple run-through once or twice without being meticulous about body form or posture.  I'm sure that after using this program as recommended, for the time recommended, it would get results.  I mostly purchased the program to flatten my stomach.  I read that a flatter stomach cannot really be obtained without toning the core abdominal area.  The program description led me to believe that the exercises on this DVD would obtain that goal."
2525,510539610,5,"The instructions and descriptions of the exercises are very clear and informative. I just could not stand the thought of having surgery to correct my prolapse and decided to give some serious exercise a try first. I have used the program for about 2 months and have noticed a great improvement. I could tell I was making progress with in the first 2-3 weeks. When I saw my OBGYN a few weeks ago, my prolapse was down graded to a stage one! I will continue to use these exercises and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this video to anyone looking to rehab their pelvic floor. It was definitely worth it for myself."
2526,510539610,5,"I had no idea before this video that inner thigh muscles had both a front and a back portion, and that they had anything to do with the pelvic basket.  ""Do your kegels and you'll be fine!"" I was always told.  Well, this DVD explains why i have super strong vaginal muscles and yet my bladder is prolapsing.  It isn't just something that happens to your body because you have kids.  Butt muscles, inner thigh, abs, and more.  You have a lot a muscles that hold up your insides.  Who knew?  Well, this person did.
I also bought vaginal weights, and I have to say I'm getting a lot more out of this dvd than the vaginal weights."
2527,510539610,5,I cannot recommend this product enough.  There are so many things to say...it improves your sex life tremendously!  It helps incontinence!  And if you have organ prolapse and are scared that surgery is your only choice...THIS DVD IS FOR YOU!  I suffered for many months with a prolapse and was terrified of having surgery (have you seen all the commercials for attorneys suing for that very surgery?!).  With regular use I've been able to stave off the prolapse!  And my sex life has been so greatly improved because I'm not longer uncomfortable or in pain!  Don't hesitate!  HabIt is worth every penny!!
2528,510539610,4,If you leak urine it might help you - I did not have that problem though and I returned it.
2529,510539610,4,"I have been doing the excerises for about 3 wks. Easy to understand. The workout instructor is a licensed physical therapist. Which is why I chose the video. My insurance company didn't cover any pelvic floor therapy so this was my next best option. She gives clear instructions and encouraging words to help motivate. Once you have mastered the workouts, there is a time saver option. I would recommend this dvd."
2530,510539610,5,"These simple exercises really work, started to notice improvements by second week. Impressed with the easy style of Tasha, wish I lived closer to her practice.
Thank you"
2531,510539610,3,"This DVD is very interesting and informative. If you are able to follow all the exercises, I believe it should be able to strengthen your pelvic muscles."
2532,510539610,5,"Great explanations, great exercises, I know it will work, I just need to commit to doing it more often. Short workout routines - so no one has any excuse not to do this if they want pelvic floor issues to get better!"
2533,510539610,5,"After four natural deliveries in as many years my pelvic floor was in need of rehabilitation. I purchased this DVD and faithfully completed the workouts. I can honestly say that after one month, my pelvic floor is in better shape than before I had children. The DVD is informative, easy to follow, and extremely effective. I highly reccomend it, and only wish I knew about it following my first delivery!"
2534,510539610,5,Very helpful video with useful imagery and exercises.  Tasha is professional and calming as she leads you through the exercises - good job!
2535,510539610,5,The explanations of the exercises are good.  I have noticed improvement after 6 weeks of doing the routines regularly.  They are about 17-25 minutes long.  Once you have the hang of it you can do a shortened one that doesn't take you thru the instructions again.
2536,510539610,4,I am yet to really get into it but I tried the first step in the process and it did seem to help almost immediately.
2537,510539610,5,I like everything about this except one thing...what's the large rubber band for?  Is this too hold up your abdomen while doing the exercises?
2538,510539610,5,"Excellent program. Very detailed and logical. Also, good blogs if one has questions after the DVD.
I just began the program but find it should be a great help."
2539,510539610,5,"If you're having pelvic floor issues, either post-partum or post-menopausal (or really, for any reason), this really does help.  Nothing is magic, and it will take time, but you will notice improvement.  It has been a God-send for me.

Also, even if you don't have a pelvic floor problem, this is a great graduated core workout that anyone, man or woman, would benefit from.  I would imagine that the posture and core strengthening would help a myriad of issues.

This is money well spent."
2540,510539610,5,"I am writing this review for any postpartum women who are crying as they are scouring the internet for solutions to their prolapse.  My pregnancy and labor did a number on my pelvic floor- very active lifting and exercising all through pregnancy, induced at 42 weeks, in labor for 30 hours, pushed for 3 hours, was being prepped for c-section when finally forceps were used at the very last second and my 9 lb 13 oz baby was born sunny side up with a very large head and his hand pressed to his forehead. I didn't stand a chance at walking away without some trauma.  I cried every night over how things looked and felt and was saving up for surgery.  6 months later my gynecologist shrugged her shoulders and said prolapse like I had to live with it.  I tried a women's health physical therapist which helped a little but not enough.

I got this DVD and wasn't sure if it was really doing anything until after doing it diligently for 4 weeks, life got in the way and I skipped the workouts for a couple weeks and all of a sudden I could feel that things were slipping back.  This truly works for me and has given me hope that things can get back in place, or at least closer to where they should be.  And I am no longer fearful of having a second pregnancy and delivery.

This is much cheaper than physical therapy, very informative, it works, and has given me hope.  I am so thankful that this product exists."
2541,510539610,4,"Just about 4 weeks into the exercises and feeling good about them. PT today said I am doing them correctly, nice to have a PT say that. Tasha does a great job of explaining and talking us through the exercises."
2542,510539610,5,"This is an excellent easy to follow dvd, I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to strengthen their pelvic floor. This really should be seen by any woman who has just come out of hospital from giving birth."
2543,510539610,5,"This DVD is well organized and offers educational content about the value of maintaining a strong pelvic floor, part of the core section that is so important to women's health. Effective exercises, well explained and demonstrated; includes sessions with and without explanation, to save time once the user has been through the initial sessions. Excellent!"
2544,510539610,5,Excellent video on exercises to  strengthen your pelvic muscles. The Physical Therapist does a great job in guiding you through 4 exercise routines.
2545,510539610,4,"I have received the product. It appears to be as described. Now, I just have to commit to using it as directed, but I do anticpate good results."
2546,510539610,5,"Recommended exercises for women who want to strengthen their pelvic region, and to help heal prolapse problems.  It has been very helpful for the person who it was given to."
2547,510539610,5,"I was traveling 25 miles each way to meet with a physical therapist and while she was wonderful, this is oh so convenient.  Tasha Mulligan explains the anatomy and physiology of a woman's body and really takes the time to explain each exercise.  It is wonderful to have a fast tract too once one is sure of the proper technique of each exercise.  For me, it is nice to see that my physical therapist and Tasha Mulligan's teaching align.  So nice to be able to do in the privacy of my own home."
2548,510539610,5,Well presented and hugely helpful product so far. It gives me a bit of hope where there wasn't much before. Knowledge is power and this DVD proves it!
2549,510539610,5,"This DVD is very well done and includes 4 rehab ""workouts"". She is a very good teacher and her cueing and instructions are excellent."
2550,510539610,5,"What a wonderful DVD! I was so thankful to the instructor Tasha for her encouragement and expertise. I was recommended to have surgery, but in only 1 month I have seen a tremendous improvement. The $30 has been worth every penny considering I won't be missing work for surgery or dealing with all the issues involved with weak pelvic muscles. She is so thorough in her directions and has a time efficient work out for those of us that are time crunched! I feel so fortunate to have stumbled onto this DVD! I can't recommend it enough! The muscles can be tricky to locate and she even uses graphics to help you isolate muscles that most of us are not familiar with."
2551,510539610,5,"I was diagnosed with a prolapsed bladder before I ordered this DVD. It's a lifesaver. There are three exercises, each lasting about 20 minutes, and then the advanced exercises that last only 8 minutes. I try to do one of the three, plus the advanced, every day, totaling only half an hour. I believe it will prevent me from having to have the surgery. Get the DVD.  It's a lifesaver."
2552,510539610,5,I love this DVD. The instructor is concise and knowledgeable. I highly recommend this to all women. It is the perfect DVD for our lower bodies. The exercises are challenging in a good way.
2553,510539610,5,This is a private way to treat pelvic floor problems. I would recommend it to any woman with incontinence problems
2554,510539610,3,"I just started using this DVD, it is very informative
DVD works good and very clear on what to do"
2555,510539610,1,You would think that people who claim to be experts about the human body would know and at least acknowledge that men are frequent sufferers of pelvic floor dysfunction - Nope. Not a word here about male issues.
2556,510539610,3,"Well, these exercises were helpful. I have found others that I like and are more portable if that means anything."
2557,510539610,5,"Very easy to follow, well explained.  So much better to do other exercises than just the kegel.  I highly recommend it to women of all ages."
2558,510539610,5,Just started the exercises this week and am very hopeful. The information just on body posture alone is very helpful-makes you so much more aware of how you stand and sit.  The exercises seem geared toward strengthening your core group of muscles....not just kegals. I really like it so far and it is even kind of relaxing.
2559,510539610,5,"Don't expect it to work overnight but stick with it and you will see improvement.  If you want to try a noninvasive solution, I think this is it."
2560,510539610,5,"I like this but didn't buy for myself.  it has several 20 minute long exercises that are very simple and easy to do.  these are the right duration compared to actual physical therapy sessions we've gone to.  so, for the motivated, determined person this can be a tremendous help and a tremendous savings of money or insurance.  and, since these can be done at home, the convenience is pretty great too."
2561,510539610,5,Very good DVD with Tasha giving very clear instructions on how to do the exercises. I purchased it because of the good reviews and would recommend it to anyone who has prolapse problems.
2562,510539610,5,Good dvd.  Easy to follow and the instructor has a great knowledge base.  I liked that there are 4 short workouts to follow.
2563,510539610,4,I don't have any medical issues.  I just was looking for something to help strengthen me.  I think this is a very informative video to help strengthen the PC muscles.  I hadn't realized there was more to remaining in tact then just kegels.  The instructions are clear with good pictures and explanations.  I do additional squats with the video after learning how important squats are for the PC muscles as well.
2564,510539610,5,"I've actually only used this program a dozen or so times, and it was enough.  It is amazing in fact, and completely reversed the symptoms I was having in a very short amount of time.  If I even remotely feel them returning, I'll be right back doing this wonderful program.  It's very informative as well and really helps you understand what's going on with your body and how to correct it!  Fantastic!!"
2565,510539610,5,Works great. Just like going to get physical therapy for a fraction of the cost. Highly recommended. etc etc etc
2566,510539610,3,So far...3 weeks into this and not impressed but still hopeful.  The therapist is a bit annoying.because she keeps repeating the same commands for each exercise. You're sure to mute the volume once you know the routine.
2567,510539610,5,"This is the best exercise video i have ever bought. If you go to Tashas website you can talk to her yourself if you have any questions, She is more than happy to talk to all customers."
2568,510539610,3,"At first i thought this DVD might be the answer to my problem, but then i noticed that there are two bad reviews and those who responded to it got really defensive about the low rating.  This makes me wonder if the good reviews were really real. If they were really written by those who actually bought the video.  I mean, everyone is entitle to their opinions, why getting bad about it.  For example, the lady who couldn't play it on her DVD player except on her computer.  Instead of getting mad, give her suggestions on what to do!"
2569,510539610,5,"This DVD is a GREAT resource! It offers women the opportunity to really DO something for their pelvic floor! As both a midwife and a woman with a pelvic floor injury, I highly recommend this DVD."
2570,510539610,5,"I have lived with my mild, yet annoying prolapse for several years,however suddenly it made a dramatic and HUGE descent, causing recurrent bladder infections, difficulty in walking, irritation and then BLOOD!. That sent me to the emergency room at my local clinic (doctor's office closed that day) where the attending physician recommended immediate surgery. He suceeded in pushing it back in and when I got home,I improvised a temporary ""sling"" and would periodically gently push ""it"" back in myself. When I got the DVD, I was absolutely amazed because after the very first work-out, there was definite improvement. Each day gets better and better. My biggest problem has been figuring out how to advance the DVD to the next segment - am sure that is my fault as I am not very skilled at dealing with my  electronic gadgets. I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL TO HAB IT:PELVIC FLOOR  and not only endorse it, but BEG  those who are dealing with prolapse to order it immediately before you consent to not-always-successful surgery."
2571,510539610,5,"I developed prolapse after moving lots of boxes three months right after my son's natural birth. The feeling of my bottom is falling down stopped me from living a normal life. I thought I will have to live with it forever and was very depressed. Then I did a lot of reading, researching about remedies and also went to a few physical therapist sessions.  I would say that this is the most helpful exercise among all. From other reviewers' comments, it seems that I will have to constantly follow this exercise; otherwise the prolapse comes back. I very much prefer doing this to  the feeling of prolapse."
2572,510539610,5,I have been very pleased with the results I have gotten after only 3 weeks of using the exercises in this DVD.  I have been very faithful in doing them at least 5 days a week but have already found the benefits amazing and I am a 66 year old woman.  Only wish I had had this 20 years earlier.  The workouts are easy to perform and the instructions are easy to understand and follow. Tasha does an excellant job of walking you through each exercise.  I would highly recommend this DVD and feel it is well worth the price.
2573,510539610,5,"GREAT video. Has great exercises that really helped me post-partum. If you really devote yourself to this and perform it daily, it can absolutely do wonders for you. The video is very easy to understand and follow. She does a great job in explaining each exercise so theres no question in how to perform them.  And it doesn't take much time at all to perform.  Great to do while the baby is napping!  Or can do with your baby lying right there with you.  Love it! Absolutely recommend!!!"
2574,510539610,5,"This is a fantastic DVD!
Every new mother needs a copy of this!
Don't wait until you develop incontinence.
Tasha's sessions are exactly what you'd get if you made the effort to go to a physical therapist.  This way you get the lessons in the privacy of you own home."
2575,510539610,5,I'm four weeks into the program and have seen great results. Highly recommend this DVD. It puts power into a woman's hands to change a condition that can be life limiting.
2576,510539610,5,"I've been using the DVD for 3-4 weeks, and I've already seen improvement.  The instructions/demonstrations on the DVD are clear and easy to follow.  Her attitude is very encouraging.

I didn't notice this on any product descriptions before I bought the DVD, but she does recommend using an exercise ball and a smaller ball for some of the exercises.  I have a small ball and have used a chair in place of the exercise ball.  (She says you can substitute a pillow for the small ball, and a chair for the exercise ball.) This has worked quite well, except that there is one exercise in the final workout that I could not on a chair.  You may have better luck, but I'm avoiding that workout, which is still too advanced for me anyway, until I get an exercise ball."
2577,510539610,5,"After the somewhat traumatic (for me) birth of my son, I had a severe prolapsed uterus.  After two years it had not improved, but had progressed to a stage three.  My OB/GYN recommended surgery.  I almost scheduled but I decided to give this a try first.  My goodness.  In four weeks I've gone back to nearly where I was before pregnancy.  I was always been ""shallow"" and I still have a couple of inches before everything is perfect, but my cervix is now at least four inches higher.  They should hand these out at the hospital.  I even had a midwife.  How could we not know about this before? I'm serious when I say this video saved me 20 grand and major surgery."
2578,510539610,1,"It will play on my desktop computer, but my computer is in my office, and I can't do exercises there.  The DVD will not play properly on my fairly new blue-ray dvd player.  It only shows the intro and posture chapters.  It will not go to the workouts.  It will only include the intro posture menu.
Now what?  It looks like a good dvd but it also looks as if I'm going to have to return it."
2579,510539610,5,"Not only does this workout strengthen the pelvic floor, but it is also strengthening my thighs & legs.  As a result, I'm becoming a better runner!  Very nice surprise!"
2580,510539610,5,"The DVD is excellent in quality and content. I am recommending it to all the gals that I am training with for the half-marathon we're running this fall. At sixty, I have enough to worry about without the constant discomfort that goes along with a weak pelvic floor. It had gotten to the point that I was not sure I could continue to train without surgery. After doing the first set of exercises I am thrilled. They are easy to do with gradual steps between each of the levels, clear instructions, and excellent graphics. Thank you so much, Tasha!"
2581,510539610,5,"After a rough delivery, at about 3 weeks I diagnosed my own rectocele. I had a natural delivery, and felt betrayed that my body was so traumatized, and found the symptoms very uncomfortable. In a fit of despair, I ordered this dvd, and was elated to find that after 2 weeks of regular use, my body started to feel normal again. Incidentally, I slacked for a week,thinking I was fixed, and my prolapse symptoms started to return. These exercises work, and also provide some gentle toning postpartum. Prolapse is something women should talk about more, and prepare each other for the possibility postpartum. I highly recommend!"
2582,510539610,5,This DVD is set up in real world format.  The workouts are labeled and timed.  So you can choose the workout you have time for.  Plus has  progressive steps to help you learn the routines!
2583,510539610,5,"I have been using this a couple of weeks & I must say its a great product, really focus on working on muscle groups and areas you wouldn't normally and glad I purchased it :)"
2584,510539610,5,"This is a great DVD that brings the physical therapy into your home. I am a mom of two toddler boys and have little to no time to myself. The workouts are short and once you do them a few times you can retain the exercises and do them throughout your hectic day as time permits.

The Education about the anatomy is a must for every women. I feel this video would be helpful for any woman, teaching us all from the start how to care for our pelvic floor.

The price is great, delivery is fast, there is nothing to loose. You have a life time of PT in your own home for the price of a co-pay!"
2585,510539610,5,I have almost lost hope to ever getting my life back after my third child. I prolapsed and it freaked me out. Praise Yahweh! I was lead to this program and it is affordable and straight to the point. I recommend this to women of all ages. Say yes to this and no to surgery! This works surgery costs a lot with failure at the end.
2586,510539610,5,"My DVD came just yesterday, but already I am very excited about this DVD.  It is very well done, and the instructor is very clear and pleasant.  I look forward to being successful in ""fixing"" my prolapse, and I also plan to pass on the information to my daughters for their future needs.  Thank you for such a well-done product!"
2587,510539610,4,"I bought this after I had my baby and had a cystocele (bladder prolapse). Tara thoroughly describes the exercises and why they help, and she's very easy to understand and listen to. However, it's not just kegels. It's also abdominal, back, and upper leg workouts, which all help more than just kegels alone. However, the workouts take a long time (the shortest one is 8 minutes, and that's AFTER you've mastered the moves first) and I just do not have time to do these with a toddler running around and my busy schedule. If I had plenty of free time or was a stay-at-home-mom, I would do these every day because I know they'd help and it has great reviews. But unfortunately I don't have the time."
2588,510539610,5,I had many problems after the birth of my fourth child. I have noticed a difference after my second workout. I was told by a doctor that nothing could be done for my prolapse. I can actually FEEL the difference in my pelvic area.  I can't wait till the sixth week results. Thank you for this dvd
2589,510539610,5,"While my wife still not 100% (she has an extreme case which has many layers to it), I will say that this dvd has been one of the only things that she does that she and I both feel is helping her.  She loves that there is a lot of guidance and explanation to begin but then, once you understand and don't want or need to take all that time to complete your workout, there is the time efficiency section.  She also likes seeing the graphic visual alongside the model performing the exercises. She likes that it is not a trendy workout so someone could have used these techniques and exercises 100 years ago or 100 years from now.  I am grateful that this dvd is out there for woman who suffer because it is a little talked about issue and it has been extremely hard to find any help for my wife.  I highly recommend it to anyone displaying any pelvic difficulties."
2590,510539610,4,"The program on the DVD itself is excellent.  Both DVDs that I received from Amazon have been scratched, but the second one plays okay.  Hopefully it keeps playing in the future."
2591,510539610,2,"I was really hoping this DVD would help, but all it did was frustrate my many attempts to play it. It came to me very dirty! After trying to play it on numerous DVD players and then cleaning it several times, the DVD finally played.  The information was good on the DVD...but the experience of trying to get it to play was grueling.
Another huge disappointment was that this item comes with no written list of the exercises...so if you want to do them on your own without a DVD player you are out of luck.  I cannot speak to the effectiveness of the exercises as it is almost impossible to do them unless you plan on doing them in the same location day after day. I thought it would come with a booklet which would be a synopsis of the contents of what the DVD contained. I am very disappointed in this<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hab-It-Pelvic-Floor/dp/0510539610/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hab It: Pelvic Floor</a>&nbsp;product."
2592,510539610,5,"I was experiencing urinary frequency/urgency after the birth of my last baby, and doing Kegels alone didn't take care of the problem. After doing these videos for just a week and a half it is no longer a problem! I can't believe how quickly it was resolved! I'd recommend it to anyone experiencing any type of pelvic or incontinence issues!"
2593,510539610,5,"I went to a physical therapist for prolapse, but did not receive this type of information. It was so helpful to have the educational content on this before starting the workout. The workouts are well paced and explained extremely well, along with how they help. Having the workout in DVD form is extremely beneficial, although it does take more time to set up. I also like the blog on their website for more information. I feel relief that this is a condition that can be changed by sticking with the program!"
2594,510539610,5,"I learned about this CD on the forum at prolapsehealth.com and started using it at 4 weeks postpartum and its just fantastic.  It is appropriate for both beginners and seasoned exercisers.  The length of each workout is perfect for busy moms.  The instructions are clear, easy to understand and follow, and anatomically correct.  The accompanying blog is very good.  The workouts are flexible and can be done alone or combined.  Most importantly, it works.  At 8 weeks postpartum I no longer have any irritating symptoms and as a delightful bonus my whole lower body muscle tone is improved.  My only regret is that I didn't know about this 4 babies ago.  Highly, highly recommend!"
2595,510539610,5,"I'm very grateful to Mrs Mullingan's Pelvic floor work-out : it's very easy to do,and after one month you can both feel and see the difference! Pelvic Floor is really ""healthier"" and it's very pleasant too, you will see your stomach is really more tough and flat. I have four children... and now I feel much more healthier and self confident. And when you begin to see results, it gives you motivation and energy, even after a rough day, to do one of the three different work-out."
2596,510539610,5,"I got this about a month ago and had done the video several times.  It made me more aware of my muscles which I have been tightening regularly, doing some of the exercises as the day went on.  I have a prolapsed uterus and cystocele since pregnancy 10 years ago, and yesterday the uterus just moved back into place!  Very cool, my body feels like it did years ago, everything in the right place.  Thanks to the people who made this video, will keep using it indefinitely!!!!!!"
2597,510539610,5,"I love this DVD so far.
There are 4 workouts.  I have been doing workout 1 and 2.  3 and 4 are more difficult.  I'm working my way up.  I'm not sure how long to stick with one workout before moving up.  AFter you learn a workout you can switch to the time efficient workout.
These exercises seem to help.  I just started a couple of weeks ago so I don't know what the long term outcome will be."
2598,510539610,5,"This is an excellent dvd for those who suffer from pelvic floor muscle weakness. I found this video to be very informative,explaining in an easy to understand manner the function of the pelvic floor muscles and the importance in regaining their strength after surgery,childbirth or simply the effects of aging. After a detailed explanation there are 3 separate segments of specific exercise routines to regain tone of the pelvic floor. I was very impressed with this video and wish I had known about it before I spent hundreds of dollars in a local physical therapy office where I felt extremely uncomfortable and embarrassed and therefore,did not obtain the positive results I had hoped for. This dvd has enabled me to practice these specific exercises in the privacy of my home without fear of embarrassment that sufferers of pelvic floor muscle problems sometimes feel. I would recommend this video to all who suffer from pelvic floor muscle weakness."
2599,510539610,5,"I purchased this DVD after being prescribed physical therapy by my Urogynecologist.  I have been plagued with muscle spasms after a hysterectomy, bladder sling and correction of a rectocele and cystocele over a year ago.  Even though I am only 42, I have been unable to sit for any length of time and unable to resume jogging and exercise.

I'm so grateful to have found this DVD on Amazon.  After only two sessions of exercises, I am already feeling fitter.

I am also very impressed that the PT responded to my feedback email and gave me some tips that have helped even more."
2600,510539610,4,"I have noticed a difference after just a few rounds, but the routines take about 20 minutes each, plus the time to set up the dvd, and I have a hard time doing them regularly. This is of course my fault, not the program's, which is an excellent program, easy to do and easy to follow. But if you have a busy schedule, you might prefer a kegel excersizer, which does't require a DVD and set amount of time."
2601,510539610,5,"This is truly a wonderful product.  I had a cystocele (bladder prolapse) after the birth of my second child and was utterly devastated at how restricted I felt because of the bothersome symptoms.  I just want to share that after only 4 weeks of doing these exercises I have had HUGE improvements.

This DVD is made by and actual physical therapist who specializes in Pelvic Floor rehab and had a grade III cystocele herself after each one of her 3 kids.  It is clear,concise and packed full of helpful info.  The exercises are not too difficult and I actually find them somewhat relaxing. It only takes six weeks (doing one of the workouts 3 times/week) to fully rehab your pelvic floor and then just maintenance Kegels after that.  It is a wonderful product for only $30!!!  I HIGHLY recommend it to ANY new mom with or without prolapse.  It can not only help current prolapse issues but also help prevent them in the future!!"
2602,510539610,5,"Having had a background in anatomy and physiology as a outcome-based massage therapist, I am quite familiar with how the body works. I have been athletic all my life until I recently had two pregnancies back to back. Both, natural births at home, took quite a toll on my pelvic floor. My midwife had a few resources which I reviewed but knew they were missing a lot of information and/or had a lot of other information I didn't care for like healing the ""spiritual"" aspect of the pelvic floor. Hab-it Pelvic Floor is like going to a high quality physical therapist in your own living room! The price is minimal for the benefits you receive. I can't sing their praises enough. Very detailed, very clear and concise, exactly what was needed for me to be guided into healing and getting things back where they belong. Already seeing a difference and it's only been a few weeks in. Note: video includes excellent information segment and then exercise segment which is divided into four different workouts. You just have to do one of the workouts each time, three times a week. So one of the four, three times a week, any of the four. The fourth being the most difficult. Once you get used to how they go, there is even a section of time efficient workouts so you can save time. Love this DVD! Recommended it to my midwife and she is thrilled about it too - giving it to her clients in the future. May consider giving this as a gift to new moms!"
2603,510539610,5,"After my 2nd baby I had a prolapsed bladder...was told by the midwife that I'll eventually need surgery & that's all I could do (surgery that doesn't even fix the problem)...

I heard about this from another Mama & so glad I got it...

After 2 times I couldn't feel the prolaspe @ all.  At the end of the 6 weeks (which is all it takes) it's completely GONE!

At first, I thought ""$30 whoa!""  But this is by a PHYSICAL THERAPIST who had prolapse herself, so if I were to go to a physical therapist, it would cost a LOT MORE AND I would have to go to an appt. a few times a week...this is awesome b/c I can stay @ home w/ my baby & newborn & do it!

I CAN'T THANK THE WOMAN WHO CREATED THIS DVD ENOUGH!!!"
2604,544451791,5,This was everything I wanted to give my son for his birthday.  He loved it!
2605,578002019,5,"We ordered Aha Chinese for our 6 year old twins.  The video animation & teaching methods are surprisingly good. Our kids were were very focused - and actually sat still - throughout the entire video. (A first!)  The instruction was easy to follow and totally engaged  the kids.
Aha Chinese really sparked their interest in Chinese culture and now our daughter takes Mandarin lessons in her after-school program."
2606,578002019,5,"This product is definitely one of the best out there right now for learning Mandarin chinese.  My 2 girls (age 4 & 6) love watching the video and actually interact with the characters out loud.  They also ask to watch it over and over because the story is amusing and they enjoy singing the very catchy songs.  The story introduces just the right number of new Mandarin words/phrases and my kids have picked up on them very quickly.  Thankfully, the book and the flashcards have the pinyin pronunciation written for the adults to be able to review the words that were introduced in the video.  We have also been playing memory game with the flashcards that are included to introduce the written Chinese language as well.  If you really want your child(-ren) to learn some Mandarin, while having fun, then this video/flashcard/book kit is for you."
2607,578002019,5,"After using so many different Mandarin educational products from here and China, I must say that Aha! Chinese is the best product on the market today.  The DVD and book really engage my 2 young children and it's easy to follow along. For the beginning student, it introduces phrases and words in a gradual and very logical way.  There is no question that Mandarin will be an increasingly important language to know in our global economy.  In addition, children need to begin learning it at a very young age in order to correctly pronounce the tones.  It's interactive, colorful, and fun while imparting key phrases and concepts in a step-by-step manner. I bought several as gifts for other friends and family who have young children learning Chinese.  Their parents could not thank me enough for finding such a great product.  You will not be disappointed. It's simply the best!"
2608,578002019,5,"I bought Guang the Chinese Dragon set for my nephew who just turned 3.  He loves it!  He watched the entire DVD as soon as his Mom put it in the DVD player!  My nephew has quite a vocabulary and is very interested when his aunt and uncle teach him Chinese.  I've looked at many learning materials to give him - books, CDs, DVDs, etc - for children for more than a year, including when I was overseas.  Many of the other learning materials out there are either poorly produced, not very interactive or engaging for children, or they are too difficult for children and their parents to follow, especially the materials developed for native speakers.  Let's Go Guang! is very different - it is engaging, with lively characters - including Guang the Dragon - to capture kids' interest, and uses effective teaching methods like songs, integrating Chinese in everyday activities like cooking with Grandma, and has a variety of ways for children to learn - the DVD story, a book that can be ready anywhere, and flash cards that let children learn at their own pace.  I highly recommend Let's Go Guang! for teaching the children in your life Mandarin Chinese with fun and creativity!"
2609,578002019,5,"As a mother about to adopt a little girl from Taiwan, I found this priceless to not only teach our son currently in our home but also for our daughter we are about to adopt to keep up with her native language. I love the characters, the video runs at a really nice pace and it is an adorable story! I have also found the flash cards included in the kit to be very helpful for our entire family including myself and my husband. We have been testing each other with them, and it has been a very fun game for all of us. I have found in the adoption world very few products that actually help like this with language skills - it has been such a blessing to have!!"
2610,578002019,5,I learned about this language program from one of my pre-K students who was speaking Mandarin extremely well and couldn't stop talking about Guang the dragon.  I was delighted with the complete boxed set.  I show the kids sections of the DVD at a time and show the mini-lessons repeatedly since they love the songs.  My students naturally repeat the Chinese as it's presented in the DVD.  The flashcards are really popular with the kids since we play the Memory Game with them.  I've also recommended `Let's Go Guang! Chinese for Children' to the parents of my students as a fun way to supplement our lessons at home.
2611,578002019,5,"This is a fabulous new product! My 5- and 3-year-old LOVE the video and always ask to watch it again once it's finished. They both repeat the Mandarin Chinese phrases as they hear them, and the repetition and use of music in the video really helps them retain the information. Likewise, the CD goes with us everywhere now, and my 5-year-old is able to read some of the flash cards also. The book and parent/educator guide are most helpful in that they provide everything you see in the video in written form. Even if learning Mandarin Chinese is not essential for you, this is a great way to introduce the language to your kids and, at the same time, learn some of the key words and phrases yourself!"
2612,578002019,5,"As a mother of 3 young children, I was thrilled to see this new product available. My children love the DVD and always choose to listen to the CD in the car. The variety of multimedia; flashcards, book, DVD, and CD reinforce their learning. After only watching a few times they are already singing the songs and using their Chinese! It's surprising to see how quickly they learn with such a comprehensive collection of materials to teach them Mandarin Chinese.

2613,578002019,5,"This is a beautifully presented Mandarin Chinese program for kids. It includes a fun to watch animated DVD, which got my kids repeating Chinese phrases after just one viewing! It also includes a CD of the songs in the video, a book, and flash cards that can be used for review or games! My kids loved watching the video and singing the songs. My 6 year old daughter picked up the flash cards and started reading them on her own after watching the video! They now love watching the video over and over.

I highly recommend it!"
2614,578002019,5,"After years of searching for a good product to help my children learn Mandarin, I've finally found the perfect product in ""Let's Go Guang!"". Aha! Chinese's new multimedia system, which includes a colorful book, fun DVD video, CD and flashcards, is fantastic! Unlike other Mandarin products for children, which focus on only teaching a few nouns per video, this product introduces and integrates useful phrases within an English context so ideas and concepts are mastered in a natural way.  Each lessons also builds on phrases learned in prior lessons.  Using both animation and live video, the DVD holds the interest of young children with songs, games, colorful animation, and cultural lessons.  The flashcards also have Chinese, pinyin and English.  As a parent, I highly recommend this product to anyone who would like to share the gift of language with their children. My kids love learning with Guang, Ling and Kai!"
2615,578002019,5,"I have 3 kids - 7, 5 and 3. I was amazed by not only how much Chinese they have learned from ""Let's Go Guang!"" but the fact that they are now so interested in learning more Chinese. They started from zero as my husband and I are not Chinese and do not speak Chinese, but after watching this video a few times, they were already saying all of the phrases to each other. They even proudly shared their Chinese to a good friend of the family, who speaks Chinese. As a non-speaker, I especially like this presentation, because the video is in English with Chinese, so my kids (and I) easily followed along with the story. The Chinese was added very naturally and repeated over and over, both in the story, and in cute little songs put to well known tunes like Frere Jacques. They're now asking me how to say everything in Chinese. I know this is supposed to be the first volume of a series - I'll be buying the second volume too!"

2617,578002019,4,"At first I was a little skeptical that the DVD combined english with mandarin because I thought that a total immersion DVD is the best way to go.  I was persuaded to buy this set after reading the reviews and giving it a shot.  To my pleasant surprise, after a few minutes of watching it with my daughter (who was riveted), I could see how helpful it was to provide a background of english for those who are being thrown into mandarin with no prior exposure to it.  It puts it into context and understanding.  The repetition and practicing of the phrases allow her to get a number of concepts / words under her belt without being overwhelmed or losing interest because she cannot understand anything going on.  After watching the story of Guang, there's a Making Dumplings with real kids, followed by a section of songs and more practicing.

What is particularly helpful is the audio CD.  We have that in the car and she loves to listen to the story and sing the songs.  This reinforces what she's learned through purely audible means and I think it's very effective.  I especially like that the songs are set to tunes that she is already familiar with.  She loves the songs and can sing all the words to them!!

I know that it might be a little pricey but like the other reviewers said, it also comes with a book, audio CD, flash cards and reference book for parents.  The reinforcement of the words through various mediums is effective.  It helps that I incorporate words into our day by saying ""ni hao"" ""wo jiao ___"" and ""xie xie"" (I just learned these for the first time through Guang!). The entire package is worth the $49.95.  I understand that Volume Two is coming out and we are going to buy that as well."
2618,578002019,5,"I purchased a several of these kits after my friends (with many grandchildren) told me about this gift set for teaching Chinese. It has Book, DVD, CD, and flash cards. I gave Let's Go Guang to my grandchildren (ranging 2- 9 yo) and I've kept one set at my own home for them to use. I must say that I'm pleasantly surprised at how much the kids enjoy the set and quickly picked up mandarin phrases. I highly recommend this set for young children who don't speak Chinese as their primary language at home."
2619,578002019,2,"The price is $49.95 and I got only 1 CD? Duh!!

The Chinese words in the CD & books are so simple -- you can learn it from Nie Hao Kailan.

Not recommended - if you want to learn chinese languages pls go to your nearest Library. There are tons of how to learn Mandarins books!"
2620,578002019,2,This was a nice 30 minute video and the extra resources are great.  But for $50 I was expecting more than a single episode!  My 9 and 12 year old sons enjoyed it and we'll watch it a few more times and practice with the flash cards.  BUT this was way over-priced!!!!
2621,578002019,5,I have been sharing Let's Go Guang with the 4 and 5 year olds at my school. The kit is very clear and age appropriate (perfect for 3 -6 year olds). It is very kid friendly and the children definitely like the silly dragon mascot. Good vocabulary and really useful repetition makes this a great introduction to Mandarin for young children. The cooking and cultural aspects also help to make it interesting and well rounded and inspired us to make dumplings in school! I would definitively recommend this kit and am looking forward to the next level.
2622,578002019,5,This product is absolutely fantastic. My family and I bought this product for my cousins. They love it! They find it so engaging with the different characters and have learned so much! This product is great for children learning Chinese. Highly recommend it!
2623,578002019,5,"As a mother of two children aged 5 and 2, and with limited Mandarin skills myself, I have searched extensively for a good way to ease them into learning Mandarin. For many years I wanted to find a way they could learn some basics in a fun and non-intimidating way that would give them the confidence and desire to pursue Mandarin as a second language.  When I found Let's Go Guang I was thrilled, and my kids love it.  They are extremely engaged by the DVD and ask to read the book all the time.  I even found that after only watching the DVD once and reading the book a couple of times, with a little reinforcement from me, my 5 year old was volunteering phrases he had learned from the kit in completely random situations. The kit really makes learning so much fun and the kids love the characters and story line.  I can't wait for the next kit to come out!"
2624,578002019,5,"I think learning other languages is a gift parents can give to those children who are interested. So, I have the Little Pim French CDs and my son watches those with much much interest. I decided to get something different (perhaps more interesting to me???) to expose him to Chinese.

My initial impressions were vey positive. The package that arrived was very professionally presented, with a DVD, a book and some flash cards. However, I am not really interested in the flash cards and the book at the moment as the idea is just to expose my 1-year old to the sounds of another language.

To this end, I think that ""Let's Go Guang"" fails in that ambition. There are so few Chinese words used. Having said that, if this was the first in a series of CDs, where new words are introduced and words from previous CDs are re-introduced, then this might be a wonderful series. Unfortunately, so far ""Let's Go Guang vol 1"" has no follow-up volume II.

I like the singing, I loved the extra footage where you see the chinese dumplings being made. Unfortunately, there was no actual recipe given for the dumplings. I guess that's what the internet's for!

I actually was a bit surprised at how short the DVD was.

This wasn't a cheap DVD but it wasn't excessively expensive for what you get (book, flash cards, DVD). Although I have criticised the small number of chinese words being used, I am not going to return this purchase. I like it, just don't love it. My little boy (and I) will just learn these key Chinese words very well whilst we wait for the next instalment....and we may buy another (cheaper) series in the meantime.

***************
UPDATE: My son is now 18 months old and has really started begging for the Little Pim French DVDs. I have just started giving him Let's Go Guang too. I am very glad that I am not teaching him two languages using the same DVDs. Although he loves Little Pim I think it would be confusing to have the French and the Chinese Little Pim DVDs.

My son seems to like Let's Go Guang quite a lot and I find myself learning quite a lot of stuff passively too. I am very glad that I didn't return this DVD and in fact I have just jumped on to the Aha Chinese website to see if there is a volume 11 yet. Unfortunately no.

He is still too young for the flash cards but I am now looking at the CD of the Let's Go Guang story and thinking he might be old enough for this in the car. Wonder if he'll like it?

This idea of exposing him to other languages is sort of an experiment. So far I am really really surprised at how interested he is in the DVDs I am showing him.

***UPDATE****
My son is now 19 months and now asks for this DVD. He likes the CD in the car too. I also noticed that the other day I had passively learned heaps of the Chinese and could recall it well. Now, I really can't wait for the next instalment. Their website says it's due Fall 2011."
2625,578002019,5,My son is 2 years old and absolutely loves Guang the dragon. He's already using many of the phrases in Chinese and I repeat them to emphasize learning. i didn't think I would remember the phrases but it comes naturally now. We're ready for more chinese and it's been 6 months since we've had the DVD. Great learning tool.
2626,578002019,2,"this product is probably good for teaching english speaking child chinese, but definitely not for a child who already understands chinese.

we bought this thinking to give our daughter (16mos old) an alternative dvd movie to watch that's all in chinese. the description said it's in english and chinese, and we thought we'd have the option to choose the language. what we got was each phrase spoken in english, then followed in chinese.  maybe there was a storyline to it, but we skipped through each chapter and didn't notice any storyline.  the making dumpling chapter was mostly in english.

we ended up returning the product, not what we were looking for."
2627,578002019,5,I am very impressed with this item.  Both my 3 yr old and 5 yr old love this...and of course they watch it over and over again.  They sing the songs all the time and are using the language in their everyday conversation.  I am waiting for the next volumes to be released.  Would highly recommend. We are Chinese but speak mostly English at home.
2628,578002019,5,"This DVD is the best I've found for helping my kids learn Mandarin.  (And we've bought almost everyone amazon offers.) My 5 year old wants to watch it every day and he loves listening to the audio CD as well.  His mandarin vocabulary has improved a lot, and what I love even more, he now peppers his speech with chinese phrases.  We hear a lot of ""wo yao"" and ""wo bu yao"" naturally popping up in our conversations.  We are eagerly awaiting the next in the series."
2629,578002019,5,"I completely disagree with the reviewer from ""USA"".  I bought the Let's Go Guang set for my kids to learn Chinese.  They love it!  My daughter asks to watch Guang all the time and she uses the phrases she's learned esp the phrase ""Wo Yao..."" or ""I want..""  Let me say, we are very committed to teaching our kids Chinese and this set has been the perfect way for them to learn about 50 useful everyday words and phrases (not just 40 words!). The pace has been just right for my daughter and fun too!  We read the book together at night, listen to the CD in the car, and I let her watch the DVD on her own.  If a child really learned all of the vocabulary taught in one sitting as ""USA"" suggested, Lets Go Guang! Must be a really effective set for kids to learn mandarin!"
2630,578002019,5,"I bought Let's Go Guang for my sister who is a mom to two girls adopted from China.  Although we are not Chinese, my sister has an academic background in Asian American studies and is very conscientious about integrating Chinese culture and language into her childrens' upbringing.  My nieces are now 4 and 7, and they are enjoying the adorable animation featured in LGG while learning their first words and essential phrases in Chinese.  I was impressed with the quality of the animation, the cute story lines which integrate Chinese themes (from gong fu to making potstickers), the catchy songs, and the beautiful packaging of the learning kit.  Would definitely recommend this product."
2631,578002019,5,"My 3-yr old daughter just loves this program and has been having a lot of fun learning Mandarin!  It's amazing how easily it is all absorbed through songs, the entertaining DVD and, our favorite, listening to the recorded book.  The kit is beautifully designed and thoughtfully produced.  It provides a memorable introduction both the language and the culture that is just a pleasure to absorb as a child and a parent.  Can't wait for the next episode!"
2632,578002019,1,"The whole DVD teaches about 40 very basic words, my 4 year old can learn all that in half day. If you are looking for a movie for your kid, or learn a few words for fun, that's ok, the book and DVD are in good quality. If you want your kid to lean Chinese seriously, go find something else.  $50 for 40 words? It's not worthy."
2633,578002019,5,I purchased this program for my 2 year old grandson and he loves the video and I love watching him watch it because he is so responsive and interacting with it.  He seems to learn so easily from the video.  I am amazed how it keeps his interest and to hear him repeat the words he has learned from it.  I can see him using this program for a long time. So many things I buy for him don't live up to expectations but this program goes well beyond  what I expected.
2634,578002019,5,"I have a 2 year old son, whose attention cannot be contained by much. He absolutely LOVED Guang! He became so interactive and responsive. He danced, and sang along even after watching it 5 times in one day! He's a little young for the flash cards, yet, but we fully intend on using this program for a long time."
2635,578047861,5,"Somos muchos la comunidad Adventista hispana aqui en los Estados Unidos.  Nosotros estamos disfrutando esta pelicula.  Es una joya de produccion.  La presentamos en todas las iglesias hispanas de Indianapolis, pero tenemos que ir traduciendola nosotros mismos.  Nos gustaria que saliera tambien en espanol.  Los hispanos son los de mas rapido crecimiento dentro de la Iglesia y nos gustaria mas material en espanol. Gracias por esta pelicula pues muestra quienes realmente somos.  Muchos no conocen nuestra iglesia y ya es hora de que pueda conocernos mejor.  Gracias."
2636,578047861,4,"As an Adventist, I enjoyed viewing this DVD.  It was fair and informative.  Seventh Day Adventists are portrayed as the thinking individuals that we are. While most of the information will be familiar to us, there were things that I learned from watching this film.

Time is given to our history and faith.  Attention is called to our health message and personal lifestyle.  However the lion's share of the film was devoted to our health institutions and professionals.  If I had one wish, it would have been to see more of the personal aspect of being an Adventist.

I recommend this DVD to Adventists and anyone who wants to know more about us and our vision."
2637,578047861,5,This is just an awesome documentary. I loved every minute of it. I am really interested in health and well being. I am sharing my DVD with so many people that I need another one for myself. I want to watch it again. It is great.
2638,578047861,5,"The Adventists film does a fantastic job of showing the cutting edge health care system and health message of one of the longest living people groups on earth. I was challenged and inspired, both to live more healthfully, and to be a more excellent nurse. I highly recommend this film to anyone even remotely interested in religion or in health. It beautifully portrays God's desire for each one of us to prosper and to be in good health."
2639,578047861,5,Martin Doblmeier did a great job with this documentary. He covers a brief history of the Adventist Church and ties this to a healthy lifestyle as taught and practiced by the church members. He highlights the present cutting edge medical work and facilities that are working to help people reach a healthy life.  There is more to the Adventist church than a healthy lifestyle but this film does a nice job covering that area. I was given a copy of this dvd to review but had already seen it and was planning on getting my own copy anyway.
2640,578047861,5,"This documentary is a great overview of the Adventist Church's health mission, history, and facilities. Doblmeier is a wonderful filmmaker who has really captured the essence of Adventism in an unbiased manner.

This is a must-see for anyone who is either looking to further understand Seventh-day Adventists, or for Adventists who want to see how others (non Adventists) view the Church.

Kudos!"
2641,578047861,5,"I AM AN ADVENTIST, SO PERHAPS I AM SLIGHTLY BIASED, BUT I FOUND THIS DVD TO BE VERY INFORMATIVE ABOUT THE HEALTHY LIFE-STYLE  OF THE ADVENTIST PEOPLE.  IT DID NOT TELL MUCH ABOUT THE DOCTRINES THEMSELVES, BUT THAT IS OK, BECAUSE THIS DVD WAS MEANT TO BE ABOUT HEALTH AND WHY THE ADVENTISTS LIVE APPROXIMATELY 10 YEARS LONGER THAN MOST OTHER PEOPLE.  AT A LENGTH OF ABOUT ONE HOUR AND 15 MINUTES, IT IS FILLED FULL OF HELPFUL INFORMATION AND DOESN'T HAVE TIME TO BE BORING.  THE ONLY THING THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IS THE TITLE; IT LEADS ONE TO BELIEVE THAT THE FILM IS STRICTLY ABOUT THE ADVENTIST RELIGION, NOT THEIR HEALTHY LIFE-STYLE.  IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED ""HEALTHY HABITS OF THE SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS""."
2642,578047861,5,"Martin Doblmeier was the person to film and make this documentary about an obscure religion. I enjoyed the film. I did not give a full five stars because it only focused on diet and exercise. Mr. Doblmeier did very well with this, aspect. I would like to have seen more of the reasons behind for food and exercise and the spiritual part of this religion.

I recommend this film for anybody wanting to know more of Seventh-day Adventists;  but also pick up some of the recommended books and web sites for more information. I also have purchased more Adventist information, they have a wonderful health wise message."
2643,578047861,4,"Though I have a few friends of the Adventist faith I was unaware of the specifics of this religion.  This film uncovers the origin and modern practices of the Adventists.  I was interested most in the emphasis this religion puts on both the spiritual and physical bodies in regards to total wellness.  I would recommend this film to friends and family of all faiths looking to learn more about this religion and its impact on living longer, healthier lives."
2644,578047861,5,"It is like Martin went through a skinny plain door into a world
he had no idea existed.  He does a great job."
2645,578047861,5,"Martin Doblemeir did a great job again.  This one tells about how the medical
work has spread around the world.  He only touched the tip of this ohe but couldnt
possibly get a grip on it it is so mamouth.  When you travel anywhere in the world,
look for the nearest health care place and most of the time, you will find one of the
Adventist ones."
2646,578047861,5,"I really wish I was one of the actors to proclaim the gospel of Christ Though I don't really know how many  Theater  courses that I would have to finished or whether I was supposed to be a film major for one them or not. But I enjoyed Adventism so much and its steadfast message that I always desire what they offer, despite individual folks in the church who might take God the wrong way who says salvation is personal.
  I hope to help the movement reach Holy Hollywood, in Jesus name Amen! I did pray a lot for Adventist film you know thank God For ""Good Good"" and goodies in The Adventist sectors. Oh! Ouch the Adventist Hospitals are so good so does the vegan and vegeterian well prepared food.
Jesus loves for giving us good and steady Adventist film in this day and age. Thank God for Chef Boyardventist

Sincerely,
Yvette Remfort"
2647,578047861,5,"The process of saving children's lives with ""weak"" hearts looks difficult, but has been accomplished for dozens of children
I would like to share the message of the Doblmeier movies with friends and family to show what is being done."
2648,578047861,5,"I like this picture because It has modern medical missionary work in earthquake stricken HAITI where 300,000 people have died.
The picture showed the immediate disaster and the long-term rehabilitation required. It pictured people at work.
It showed that people still care and help others in need"
2649,578047861,5,"Martin Doblmeier has once again produced a very factual, interesting documentary. We found this particular documentary especially meaningful since friends and family members appear in it. Amazon.com came through with prompt, safe shipping as always."
2650,578047861,5,"This was a great video, and learned a lot. It was very informative about the Adventist role in the health care industry."
2651,578047861,5,I saw this on PBS and just had to have the DVD for myself and family concerning all of the great health stips shown here.
2652,578047861,5,"The Adventists 2 was an amazing insight into the motivation behind Adventist Health Care Missions.  As a veterinarian and a life-long Adventist, I have had clients who sought me out because of their experience with Adventist physicians.  This documentary offered an in-depth view of the state of Adventist Healthcare and especially the philosophy and vision which the Adventist Church brings to it.  I found myself watching with pride as physicians were interviewed who were truly motivated not by economic gain, but by the opportunity to serve - to serve their God and to serve their fellow men and women.  Some of those physicians were people with whom I had gone to college.  This film makes me proud that my son is currently in medical school at Loma Linda University, where he is exposed to this amazing service-oriented philosophy and mission-minded provision of health care.  Thanks for this insight into the world of Adventist healthcare.  I strongly recommend this film to anyone who wishes to gain the same insights or those who doubt that a church organization can achieve unselfish service."
2653,578047861,5,"A most beautiful story. True and unselfish love for others, totally unselfish. I highly recommend that everyone see this one."
2654,578047861,5,"As a retired  Adventist nurse, I teach and promote healthy nutrition classes  and In Step For Life exercise.  This
DVD has given me inspiration and encouragement to continue to serve my church and community."
2655,578047861,5,Thank you for offering this DVD.  I saw the first DVD and was very interested in seeing the second one.  Thank you for offering this interesting and informative DVD.
2656,578047861,5,"If I had to describe this film with one word, it would be 'inspirational!'  It demonstrates effectively how the Adventists are putting God's word in action by 'doing for the least of these.'  The film made me stop and take stock of my own life!"
2657,578047861,5,These people are truly selfless. They think of others more highly than themselves. If I was younger I would love to go on a mission trip with them.
2658,578047861,5,"I may be considered a little biased as my family spent 3 1/2 years as medical missionaries in Brazil working with the Seventh-day Adventists. Before becoming an Adventist myself about 15 years ago, I had never even heard of Seventh-day Adventists. Even today, many other denominations are still confused about who Adventists are, even though the Kelloggs cereal company was started by Adventists as part of their medical/health evangelism. Don't take others people's word for it, check them out for yourselves, Adventists are in more parts of the world, have more schools, more hospitals, than any other Protestant denomination. Are some of their doctrines unique? Yes, but most assuredly they are Biblical. I personally had read the Bible through many times and wondered where the churches were that preached the Bible as written before I became an Adventist. Adventists are not ""New Testament"" Christians they are ""Bible"" Christians. The video does a great job of bringing out the medical-missionary work."
2659,578047861,5,"I may be considered a little biased as my family spent 3 1/2 years as medical missionaries in Brazil working with the Seventh-day Adventists. We actually met the American couple doing work along the Amazon River. Before becoming an Adventist myself about 15 years ago, I had never even heard of Seventh-day Adventists.

2660,578047861,5,"Doblmeier has done it again. After watching this excellent film on the medical and altruistic ministry of the Seventh-day Adventists, I felt very uplifted to know that there are people that put their effort into tangible and practical ways for the common good. Martin Doblmeier has done the Christian community a service telling us about different Christian stories of 'faith being alive' (see his commentary in the special feature of the ""director's Comments"" on the DVD) in people's lives. His work on Dietrich Bonheoffer and the Power of Forgiveness of the small community of the Amish people were second to none. And with this second serving of the Seventh-day Adventist Medical and Philanthropic Mission to the far corners of the world, he continues to tell a story of the faith that is active and that makes a difference. I highly recommend this film and anticipate many great documentaries from Doblmeier's creative filmaking and intentional and energetic filmosophy."
2661,578047861,5,"Adventists 2 is a great documentary. It tells the stories of people helping other people in all parts of the world. The cinematography is professionally done with beautiful views of exotic locations. The stories flow nicely along and kept me interested during the entire film. Overall, I place this movie at the top of my list of favorite documentaries. It is on par with any other docs I've seen."
2662,578047861,4,"A dynamic and thought-provoking representation of the Adventists. A surprise cinematic gem. Not to be missed, especially if you enjoyed the first one."
2663,578047861,5,"The Adventists 2 moved me.  It portrayed the Adventists' ability and determination to make a difference in the far corners of the world.  These people would have dedicated their lives with no desire for recognition nor do they care whether or not anyone even knows what they were giving....and in most cases, these people have dedicated their entire lives to helping people medically.  Thank Goodness there are people like this director, Doblmeier, who are willing to follow them LITERALLY to the ""far and dangerous corners of the world"" to tell us their heart-warming stories.  Totally enjoyable learning experience for anyone and everyone!  I TOTALLY recommend."
2664,578047861,5,"I watched both ADVENTISTS and ADVENTISTS 2, and highly recommend both movies. They have made me think how health is the most important thing for each person - young or old, rich or poor. Unfortunately, so many people around the world don't have the access to quality healthcare. The ADVENTISTS 2 tells stories of doctors and nurses who travel to most remote places in the world and try to improve health of the local population.

Excellent movie!"
2665,578047861,5,"Adventists 2 was shown at SON Screen. I liked it even better than the first film. Afterwards the young camera man, a graduate from Southern Adventist University who Doblmeier hired, talked about his experiences making the film. There are several surgery scenes and he described trying to get good shots while still staying out of the way of the doctors. The film also tells the story of a group from Kettering that regularly does short term mission trips. As usual, Doblmeier has done an excellent job."
2666,578047861,5,I really enjoyed seeing some of the world's healthiest people who also live longer.  I just wish the documentary was longer....and contained more information about how they live their everyday lives.  I don't know how difficult this life style would be to copy in my life.  I would like to know more.  Longevity really is a big interest and avoiding illness really interests me.
2667,578047861,5,As a Seventh-day Adventist I highly recommend this DVD. It's informative even for us. It's also a great way to introduce others to our health message and benefits of following God's way.
2668,578047861,5,"A wonderful documentary, just wish it had been longer or done in several parts.  Loma Linda Hospital has long been known for their cutting edge treatment plans and their 'eat healthy, live healthy' diet lifestyles."
2669,578047861,5,"This is an excellent production.  A good blend of Adventist beginnings and their current distinctive features.  It is an important contribution to health and health care.  I applaud the Adventists for not turning over health care to gov't only, but continuing to make it a mission of the church, in the tradition of Jesus and the church through the centuries.  Great."
2670,578047861,4,I really enjoyed the film but I'm hoping the next one will include more of the Seventh-day Adventist church as the health message is well covered in the first film!  Looking forward to seeing the next one on Adventists (International) he is planning.
2671,578047861,5,"This is an excellent presentation of the Adventist message of well being and wellness. It is also, true there are many other facets of the Adventist faith, practices and doctrine that are not included. The author is focused on one specific core value, and briefly includes an overview of Adventist history and beliefs.

There are some who would say that Adventists are, believe or act in ways that are intepreted as or understood as negative or unflattering. In truth, Adventists are little more than a microcosm of our world, there are and will be ""flakes to fanatics"" and ""saved to surrendered"" within the membership.

There a millions of Adventists who represent their faith with excellence and outstanding investments of time, talent and treasure. Adventist humanitarians, educators, attorneys, medical personnel, military and government leaders; as well as every other walk of life, in almost every country of the world, are contributing members of society impacting the world in positive ways in the name of Jesus.

Adventists are not perfect, any more than any other faith tradition, or than those who choose no faith... just people being transformed daily to imitate the Savior in deeds, thoughts and beliefs."
2672,578047861,3,"Purchased as a gift, upon request, for a friend. I did not read it, but I understand recipient found enjoyment reading."
2673,578047861,1,"Don't be swayed people. I was an SDA for 35 years. The doctrine of the church goes against the Gospel of Jesus Christ in so many ways, it's not even funny. Rather than buy this movie, might I suggest that you buy one or all of these books to find out the history & doctrines of the SDA church.

2674,615115187,5,"George Lucas said it himself when he reviewed it, ""this movie is the life story I wish i had."" With it's references to all 3 of the star wars movies and the great acting, George Lucas in love is possibly one of  the greatest short films ever made. I'm not the only one who thinks so.  Apparently the people at the Texas Film Festival, the U.S. Comedy Arts  Festival, and the Tahoe International Film Festival, who gave such awards  the 2000 Audience Choice Award and the  2000 Best Short Film think's it's  pretty funny too."
2675,615115187,5,"Wow!  This video had it all...confict,love,creativity.  The whole family loved it and we have shared it with all our friends to rave reviews.  The film quality was top of the line, and we especially enjoyed the  setting...USC.  A great first endeavor for Levy and Nussbaum, they have  great potential and we will look forward to seeing future works by these  impressive TROJANS!"
2676,615115187,5,"1967 film student George Lucas has writer's block trying to finish his ""Space Wheat"" script, until a beautiful fellow student with a familiar hairstyle teaches him that the best stories are in plain sight.
Full of cleverly subtle (and some not-so-subtle) references to  ""Star Wars"" and George Lucas's other films, this film has taken  its place on the list of great ""Star Wars"" spoofs. A short film  that gets better with each viewing."
2677,615115187,4,"George Lucas in Love is a must see for any one who considers themself a fan of the original Starwars trilogy. Its hilariously funny, with subtle references enough for any diehard while also being accessible for the casual fan."
2678,615115187,5,"An ultra-funny parody of the college life of George Lucas and how he was inspired to write the ""Star Wars"" trilogy."
2679,615115187,3,"This DVD is fun. Not the best of all the Star Wars Satires I have seen, but certainly on of the few that focuses on George Lucas and his universe.
Done to the tone of ""Shakespeare In Love"", this movie has cute moments, Star Wars inuendos and some clever diaglogue. The performances are very good too.
It's cute. For the Die Hard - Star Wars fan this is a must. Be warned, its very short!"
2680,615115187,4,"Ok, so I never saw ""Shakespeare in Love"".  After watching this 10 minute Star Wars/Shakespeare spoof, I'm not sure I want to.  I'm sure it's a fine movie, but what ""George Lucas in Love"" accomplished in only 10 minutes surely can't be improved over the course of a 2-hour movie (perhaps I'm also still bitter that it beat ""Saving Private Ryan"" for best picture of 1998.. grrrrr).  That little rant aside, Star Wars is probably the most frequently spoofed movie or cultural phenomenon of all time (with Star Trek running a close second).  This current incarnation takes its inspiration from ""Shakespeare in Love"" and finds a college-age George Lucas struggling to find his inspiration to write an 'agricultural space opera' for his final project.  As he walks across campus to meet with his advisor, you see many quirky schoolmates who seem to have inspired different characters and plots in Star Wars, from Han Solo to Jabba the Hutt.  Even his advisor engages in the backward speak that defines Yoda.  George finds his inspiration in the form of an attractive co-ed who's hairstyle seems vaguely familiar.  There is even a little twist that romance that I dare not mention.  This is a hilarious send up of two very successful movies and definitely worth the 9 minutes you will spend watching it."
2681,615115187,5,"In ten minutes, how many allusions to Star Wars and George Lucas lore can you make?  Well, if you're the director of ""George Lucas In Love,"" (aka GLIL) dozens.  With a wonderful sense of comedic timing and a finely honed script, GLIL manages to keep its viewers engaged... and looking forward to seeing the next reference to Star Wars.  And for non-Star Wars fans, there's even a version of the film on the DVD explaining the jokes and references, a la ""Pop Up Video.""
There are some other short films on the DVD too, but they're not as good as GLIL."
2682,615115187,5,"The plot of this short film revolves around the young George Lucas in his senior year of film school. He's trying to write a great agricultural space epic, but can't seem to put anything together until he meets a beautiful girl with big hair in the student theatre. She encourages him to write what he knows and from there it's movie history.
The DVD version of this short film includes a short commentary by the film's creators, an enhanced version of the film (basically a pop-up video trivia veiwing), a short ""making of"" documentary, chapter search, and a ""special"" secret feature (the code number is 1138). For being a short film, a lot of these features seem redundant. However, they fit in with the spirit of the film and make the DVD that much more entertaining.
Also included on the DVD are three other shorts. EVIL HILL is a parody of the Austin Powers films and the movie NOTTING HILL. A young Mr. Evil (he's not a doctor yet) is treated like a monster by the people in his small town in Bavaria. However, one day Marilyn Monroe wanders into his children's book store and his life is changed forever.
FILM CLUB is a parody of the movie FIGHT CLUB. If you haven't seen the movie, this short parody will make no sense whatsoever. The final short is SWING BLADE, a parody of SLING BLADE and SWINGERS. That short is filmed as a coming attraction and shows what would happen if Karl from SLING BLADE moves to L.A. and hooks up with the gang from SWINGERS.
Overall, a highly entertaining DVD that fans of STAR WARS and/or film buffs will enjoy."
2683,615115187,4,"This was extremely entertaining for me as I am a huge Star Wars fan, but beware it is only 9 minutes in length.  As long as you go in with that expectation, I'm sure you will find this to be an enjoyable short film.  You also get 3 other shorts on the disc, but they are all less than 10 minutes in length.  Evil Hill was far less entertaining than I had hoped."
2684,615115187,5,"I've been a Star Wars fan for all of my 20 years and was very impressed by this short film.  I had heard of this fan-fiction short film on the internet but never bothered to download it.  Recently I saw it at a local media store for (a low price) previously viewed on DVD and promplty grabbed it (just got a DVD player and the only other movie I had was Spaceballs).  This short movie was absolutely amazing.  I assure you the only way it could be any better - a full length movie instead of a short film.  My DVD wasn't macrovision encoded so you get awesome video quality - much better than you'd get downloading the film from the web.  Plus a great musical score, scene selection (really necessary on a short film?) and 3 other short films that are also worth watching, especially Evil Hill... Be sure to see Mediatrip.com for the code to unlock the secret bonus section, its worth your time!"
2685,615115187,5,"I haven't seen either ""Swing Blade"" (although I love the concept) or ""Evil Hill"", but I've seen (and laughed myself almost into a hernia) both ""Lucas in Love"" and ""Film Club.""
One reviewer complained about how ""Film Club"" is only funny to people with noses in the air.  Quite the opposite, although only film geeks will get it.  A deserving mocking of both David Fincher's pretentious feature and the rules of Dogme 95 (which has produced some breathtakingly stupid, boring, and cliched movies), this is a stone riot.
""Lucas In Love"" anyone will get, probably as much a tribute to Star Wars' pop cultural presence as anything.  It's not mean-spirited or ironic in any way (well, okay, maybe Lucas' ""source"" for the Force cuts a little closer to the bone than the rest of the gags if you know some Warsies), it's light, simple fun.
Definitely this is worth fifteen bucks.  If nothing else, it's a great party disc!"
2686,615115187,5,"This was a very good short.  I love the way it shows how George Lucas got all of his ideas about how he wrote starwars.  The cast was very good also, who ever played Yoda I think did a fantastic job, I thought that was the best part of the movie.
  Oh and no, I am not a Starwars fan at all, even if you've only seen bits and pieces of starwars this movie is hilairious.  I don't think I ever sat through the whole starwars movie before and I thought this was great.
  If you are a big fan of Austin Powers you should get this one too.  Evil Hill was a good one too.  Swing Blade was even better.  But I did not like Film Club, I thought it was kind of stupid but there was some funny stuff in there."
2687,615115187,5,"George Lucas in Love may very well be the ""Form"" of a short film - what the perfect short film should be, in a higher realm of understanding.  A low-budget, well-shot, beautifully scored, and endlessly engaging piece of work, Joe Nussbaum's clever little feature never falls into film-school pretentiousness or short-film stupidity.  Although it is a one-joke premise, the directing and editing manage to keep things moving fast enough that it doesn't get old.
The 8-minute short opens with George Lucas, in his last semester at film school, unable to finish his final project, Space Wheat, which begins ""Not Long Ago in a Nearby Galaxy.""  His teacher (a stubby guy who talks like a certain Jedi Master) is no real help, and it isn't until he meets a girl with hair wrapped tightly in donut-buns (a stunning Lisa Jakob, of Independence Day fame) that he finds a muse who encourages the young Lucas to ""write what he knows.""  What he knows is the dozens of Star Wars references surrounding him, and the rest, as they say, is history.
As much an homage as it is a parody, Lucas in Love succeeds where so many others fail.  A review of the three other shorts on the DVD - ""Evil Hill"" (Dr. Evil meets Notting Hill), Film Club (Fight Club in a film school), and Swing Blade (Sling Blade mixed with Swingers) easily demonstrates how this type of experiment can fall flat on its face, turning into a gigglefest by filmmakers and audiences with the kinds of noses that stick up in the air.  Thankfully, Lucas in Love is never reduced to this insipid level of ""didja get it?  didja?  aren't we CLEVER!!!) that the other films on the DVD do (and, unfortunately, so many other short films available on the Internet).
The DVD features a commentary track by the director and producer, which reveals little about the film (there isn't much time in an 8 minute session), but there is a ""making of"" that actually lasts longer than the film itself - perhaps a first in DVD history - that has all the major players and some great behind-the-scenes stuff.  The real gem is a pop-up video version of the film that shows you all the Star Wars references - chances are, unless you are the most obsessed fan out there, you missed at least one.  There is also a secret code area where you can enter a numeric code you get from mediatrip.com, makers of this DVD.  Considering mediatrip.com is now defunct, I don't feel bad saying that the code is 1138 (as in THX-1138, one of Lucas' early films) and that the secret is a short clip of the director showing off his letter from George Lucas congratulating him on the film.
Is it worth the money for this DVD?  Up to you.  Basically, it's a question of how big of a Star Wars fan you are.  You can download the film from several places on the net, and the SciFi channel runs it every now and then, but if you want the interviews and a crystal-clear transfer, then it's probably worth it.  Besides, it's great to roll out for your friends and show them without boring them."
2688,615115187,5,"This is one of the best parodies I have ever seen. The premise is a young George Lucas, having writer's block, trying to come up with a story that would be timeless. His experiences and encounters with the people in this short movie help build up the myth that is Star Wars.
Now with that introduction over with, let's get into the specifics of how good/bad this DVD actually is. Like I said above, this is an awesome pardoy, spoofing both Star Wars and Shakespeare in Love at the same time. The cast is very well selected and when they show up on screen you can immediately tell which Star Wars character they're supposed to be. The jokes are never forced and are honestly funny, the false ending is absolutely hilarious, as is the actual ending itself. All in all, look forward to having loads of laughs at the story.
However, and I think a lot of critics will agree with me, George Lucas in Love is really too short. I know, I know, it's supposed to be a short movie, but the creators have really whetted my appetite for more. 10 minutes is way too short for a DVD of this caliber. Sequel please ???
There are a few other short clips included in the DVD, including Swing Blade (a parody of both Sling Blade and Swingers), Film Club (a parody of Fight Club) and Evil Hill, which is, like the George Lucas in Love short, essentially an Austin Powers prequel. It depicts the youth of Doctor Evil set in Bavaria a la Notting Hill and it shows how his origin started.
This DVD is fantastic in the comedic sense, hence my 5 star rating above, but don't buy it unless you're a real hardcore Star Wars fan, it's not worth the money."
2689,615115187,5,"Great story, Great acting, Beautifully Edited, Well shot, and funny too... I'm glad I own this one."
2690,615115187,4,"This was an excellent film.  Gosh, if only it could have been longer!  The commentary and the making-of pieces are equally as entertaining.
The other shorts on the DVD version leave a little to be desired.  But Lucas is great!"
2691,615115187,4,"Some folks talk about what they could do given enough time, money, connections, blah, blah, blah.  Well, these guys have demonstrated what can be done with some talent and action.  This door-opener short is excellent - funny, insightful, and executed with finesse.  You like Star Wars? Get this for your collection."
2692,615115187,2,"I'm sorry,  I just felt like this flick was one joke told again and again for about twenty minutes.  I think it would be more amusing as a concept you share with your friends at a bar one evening, but as a completed short film...you should probably borrow it, as opposed to renting or buying."
2693,615115187,5,"This short film is a parody between Shakespeare in Love and Star Wars. The main plot is about young George Lucas in college and he's trying to come up with a great screenplay. Throughout his daily activities, we see where he gets his inspiration. Even though I didn't see Shakespeare in Love, I was still able to get most of the jokes. This is a VERY funny film and is worth watching over and over again. If you're a Star Wars fan, you might also want to try Hardware Wars."
2694,615115187,5,"As a Star Wars fan, I wasn't sure what to expect from this short film. Buying it more on a whim than for any other reason, I popped it in the VCR and promptly laughed so hard that I nearly fell out of my chair! The worst thing about the film is that it is so short, the best thing is that it is short enough that you can go back and watch it over and over in order to catch the lines and nuances you'll miss while laughing so hard. This film imaginatively captures the genesis of every Star Wars character and does a wonderful job of showing a ""plausible"" reason for George Lucas to have created his masterpiece. Star Wars fanatics and casual fans alike will enjoy this extremely well done short film. In my opinion, it would make a great addition to any video collection."
2695,615115187,5,"Wow! During the 9 minute span of this short film, these folks were able to throw in every Star Wars/Lucas joke possible (even the low-blow ""Howard the Duck"" joke before the credits). ""George Lucas In Love"" is some wildly funny and entertaining stuff! The character swaps keep the humor moving, yet the nice production gives the film a professional gloss.
For people who are still uncertain about plucking down some cash for a 9 minute DVD, the extra shorts appearing on the film are fairly entertaining as well! ""Evil Hill"" and ""Swingers"" are slightly less affective than the feature, but very funny nonetheless. ""Film Club"" was just. . . silly! The tons of extras included also add to the viewer's entertainment factor."
2696,615115187,5,"The sentiment of ""why buy it when you can download it for free?"" isn't even close to being valid here. It's just not possible to appreciate the excellent production and effort that went into this short on a jumpy computer screeen.  This is a real film, worthy of a full-size theater. Lacking that, your TV is the next best thing. Even if you already have the VHS, you won't regret buying the DVD. It's not just the lovely print and sound of the title short, but the copious extras which make this DVD a real bargain. The background and commentary on George Lucas in Love is great, though much of the information is repeated in various forms. Still, it's fun to know how this short came about, and to realize it was truly a professional production all the way around. The additional short films are great to have as well, though you can tell their budgets are far smaller than that of GLIL! Swing Blade is laugh-out-loud funny, but the Film Club short is not to be overlooked. It's a spot-on parody of the Fight Club trailer--the detail is perfect, right down to Brad Pitt's gestures and Edward Norton's expressions. Any fan of Fight Club (and if you have a DVD player you MUST have a copy of Fight Club, right?) will get a big kick out of it. The Evil Hill parody--despite a terrific Dr. Evil impression by Timothy Dowling--is slow and uninspired. This is the guy who thought a live-action Rugrats movie would be a good idea. Mr. Dowling is clearly talented, but judging from this work he needs to stay friends with people who can tell him when his ideas stink. Come to think of it, George Lucas could use a bit of that kind of help as well."
2697,615115187,5,"This parody on ""Shakespeare in Love"" mixed with ""Star Wars"" is an excellent job of filmwork at its best.  George Lucas has writer's block at the worst possible time, he needs a script to pass film school!  Inspiration is gone and he must find his muse to get the creative juices flowing again.  Fortunately, the script for ""Star Wars"" is all about him, he only needs to open his eyes and see it.
The only problem with this short - is that it is too short.  You will have to watch this about 10 times in a row just to fill your thirst for it.  This will leave you laughing every time.
The DVD is well done, but the rest of the shorts on the DVD are merely OK.  The extras are nice and really worth watching."
2698,615115187,5,"After reading the customer reviews of this fantastic short film, I find it amazing that the ones who violently depise it fail to realize one simple fact:
This is NOT A STAR WARS PARODY!  It is a SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE parody!  Okay?!?!  All the Star Wars fans who dissed this film for making ""hackneyed Star Wars references"" for no reason at all do not realize that the references are not STAR WARS references, they are references to SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE.  It doesn't surprise me at all that a healthy chunk of Star Wars fans haven't seen or even know what SHAKESPEARE is about.  I guess if a movie doesn't have action figures made from it or can't be found at one of those insipid sci-fi conventions, then it must not be worth watching, huh?  Let's also keep in mind these are liekly the same morons who gave good reviews to PHANTOM MENACE.
Yikes."
2699,615115187,5,"This film manages to parody Shakespeare in Love AND Star Wars in an astonishinly small eight or nine minutes. And I laughed the whole time! I don't recommend this if you haven't seen the films...or if you're such a rabid fan that you cannot put up with people making fun of the Star Wars characters. Basically, every character shows up in a ""college-campus alter-ego."" From a drugged-out hippie (Obi-Wan) to Lucas's athsmatic black-clad neighbor (guess who) nearly everyone from the trilogy is included.
And of course, the end is more twisted than his girlfriend's Princess Leia hairdo!"
2700,615115187,5,"I've seen other Star Wars parodies, and this one is up there with the best of them, not only parodying Star Wars, but 1999 Best Picture Shakespeare in Love.  It is well researched into Lucas' undergraduate life at USC, and even references 2 of his student films.  It also captures even the littlest and obscure Star Wars references.  A short film in 8 minutes, it's worth the admission price!"
2701,615115187,4,"Just received my DVD of ""Lucas"" and the other films and thought that Lucas looked much better on the DVD than on the internet.  I especially liked ""Swingblade"" but how come no comments from those guys?  Also, Film Club was good but I didn't get all the references.  All in all a great group of films!"
2702,615115187,5,"This is the best short film I've ever seen.  It's perfect for Star Wars fans, aspiring writers, or anyone who likes to laugh.  Until I saw this film i don't think I had ever laughed uncontrollably for nine straight minutes, but now I have."
2703,615115187,1,A 30 second joke told over and over.  You can almost feel thesmarm lapping around your ankles.
2704,615115187,5,"I remember clearly when Hardware Wars came out, with my sister and me howling with laughter at the clever parody. We loved Spaceballs, with its jabs, too. Being a great fan of both the Star Wars trilogy and of Shakespeare in Love, I was laughing out loud at this deft combination of the two done in a mere 9 minutes. It's like the super-fast-Shakespeare spoof which is making the theater rounds - a blast to catch all the subtle innuendos!
What's the cost for the video - about the price of a Big Mac these days? I'd gladly pay double for the fun this has been at parties and when friends come over. I don't have this much fun with a lot of commercial sludge that's out on the big screen, that's for sure! Well worth it ... but see for yourself!"
2705,615115187,5,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas and previewed ""to be sure it ran fine.""  LOL  I have watched this movie short about 6 times now and everytime I watch it I see yet another reference to the Star Wars Trilogy or Shakespear In Love.  A must have for the Star Wars enthusiast."
2706,615115187,4,"I saw this film in English class a couple days ago because my eccentric and wonderful sophmore english teacher had Dowling, a creator of the film, a couple years ago.  His sister is currently at Wellesley High School.  This film is very creative, and quite humorous to even non Star Wars fans.  I was surprised to find it here...it is reasonably steep for a 9 minute spoof.  However, for star wars buffs, or people who want to share it with friends, this is a worthwhile purchase."
2707,615115187,2,"Probably just because of all the hype about it, when I finally got a chance to see it (on the Sci-Fi channel's ""Exposure"" show) I  ended up only finding it fair at best. It's basically one very simple joke  told repeatedly. This isn't a terrible thing as the film was so short, but  surely something much better and much funnier could have been achieved with  the same idea.
My recommendation is that you watch it before buying. You  may, like me, not see what all the hype is about."
2708,615115187,2,"Unfortunately cinematography and music are really all there is to this short. The rest was soulless and pretty weak comedy. The film has nowhere  near the passion of ""Hardware Wars,"" etc., and the comic moments  are highly repetitious (they have to be because of the ""idea""  behind the short, I guess, but that doesn't mean it's enjoyable). But I did  enjoy the way the cinematography and music danced around both films they  are spoofing, and the actors were decent, so I give it a 2.
Don't fall  for the hype.
X, the Unknown"
2709,615115187,3,"I will admit that the jokes and parodies were humorous, there was definate much more that could have been done.  Have you ever watched a movie and  said to yourself, ""man, if they would have let me make that movie, it  would have been so much better.""  This is one of those movies.  They  blew past the jokes so fast, you couldn't even appreciate them.  They tried  to cram so much into the 8 minutes, there wasn't enough time to really  expand and make it a movie that had real replay value.
If you're sharing  this with some friends, go ahead and get it.  But, if you plan on watching  it this by yourself, don't waste your money."
2710,615115187,5,"I saw this when I was scanning for another movie on Amazon. I read the reviews. Then I saw that it was only 9 minutes. I did some more shopping a  month later and I remembered this film. I was still intrigued. I loved all  of the behind the scenes stuff about Star Wars, and George Lucas is such an  incredible visionary. So I said, ""What the heck"" and bought the  movie. The most deciding factor was actually all the rave reviews that  people left.  Well I got the film and I was impressed. In such a short  film, go get so much out of it, and feeling like I just stepped out of a  Star Wars movie when I got done - just that overpowering feeling that  simply is awe...  I highly recommend this movie to anyone."
2711,615115187,3,"$8.00 for Nine miutes!  Even though it was enjoyable to see where George got his ideas from, if its any truth to it. This should have been an add-on  or a gift when you purchased over a certain amount of Star Wars stuff from  a store. How many 9 minute tapes do you own? That you had to purchase?"
2712,615115187,5,"Liked it much I did.  Humor intelligent, details done well they were."
2713,615115187,5,"If you've seen the Trilogy, and are at least a semi-star wars fan, you'll LOVE this movie.. It covers so much in 8 minutes, that it doesn't seem that  short. I don't think I've laughed so hard in years! One thing, tho.. Don't  let anyone tell you anything about it. Just watch it. You'll love it!"
2714,615115187,5,This short is hilarious.  All the little cameos really do the film justice.  A great amount of cleverness is packed in to this 8 minute wonder.  After seeing this movie I would definetly reccomend it to anyone who has seen the Trilogy!
2715,615115187,4,"This is a very enjoyable 9-minute movie, and you don't have to be a diehard Star Wars fanatic to enjoy it.  You just have to have seen the 3 initial movies.  The price is a bit high ($12 including shipping), but  worth it if you'll split the price with some friends.  After all,  Blockbuster doesn't have it.
BUT, don't look at the box or talk with  people about it before watching it.  Remember, it's only 9-minutes long.  There are lots of scenes on the box that you'll find quite funny in the  movie if you're NOT already anticipating them.  Don't lose the fun of half  the movie by seeing half the jokes beforehand."
2716,615115187,5,"this mini-movie is a must for all Star Wars fans!  I laugh through the entire thing everytime I watch it.  It plays just like a Monty Python movie -- every time you watch it, you find something you didn't see before.  The  actors gave superb performances.  I hope they produce a follow-up to this  one!"
2717,615115187,5,"I watched this for the first time with a group of friends, all Star Wars fans. About half of us had seen Shakespeare in Love, but we'd all seen the various Star Wars movies many times. The movie produced gales of laughter.  Several times we had to stop and back up because we were unable to hear the  dialogue following one of the gags. I'd highly recommend this for any Star  Wars fans - it's definitely good for a laugh."
2718,615115187,5,"This is by far the greatest short film of the year. Being a spoof is one thing but being a good spoof on a great concept is what makes this video outstanding. Everything from the Vader-esque neighbor to the beard on  ""Lucas'"" chin is relevent in either the fabled  ""Trilogy"" or real life. This director knew what he was doing and  did it with passion. To reiterate: This is the a truly wonderful comedy  about an absolutley amazing man. It gets my thumb way up."
2719,615115187,5,"This is truly one of the funnier Star Wars things I have ever seen. There seems to always be a Mad magazine spoof, or references to the Trilogy + 1 in a Kevin Smith film, and while these kinds of pop culture type references  are amusing, I have to say this short blows anything else away. And the  thing with this is you get the references, they are right there in the  open, no thinking involved and you laugh everytime. For Amazon's asking  price.... and if you are hoplessly devoted to the Saga..... then buy this  film."
2720,615115187,5,"Reading many of these reviews after having seen the movie myself, I've come to the conclusion MANY seem to agree with: This was an amazing film, and those who criticize it are upset that they didn't think of the idea  first! It was a 9-minute independent film, and yet wove through Star Wars,  George Lucas, and Shakespeare in Love so slyly, that you must applaud Mr.  Nussbaum, Mr. Dowling, and Mr. Levy for an amazing piece of cinema.
To  those who criticize, go ahead and nag! The people, however, have spoken,  making it the most downloaded movie ever on the Internet, and I understand  that Mr. Nussbaum is the talk of Hollywood as the next big director out of  USC. Don't take my word for it - Read the Wall Street Journal, People  Magazine, and the New York Times! If the biggest complaint is that 'Lucas'  isn't long enough, it's a testament to the genius and skill of those  involved. Bravo!"
2721,615115187,5,"Very clever, very funny.  Joe has a dazzling career ahead of him.
You go, Joe!
Kathie Coulson, Former co-worker and Fan"
2722,615115187,5,George Lucas In Love is an excellent example of what a student film should be:  It gives us a taste of the director's style.  The fact that he was able to add so many elements to a nine minute film is truly outstanding!  When watching this film make sure to take notice of the use of camera  angles and the timing of the whole film.  That is what makes this something  you should go out and purchase.
2723,615115187,5,"GEORGE LUCAS IN LOVE is a parody of ""Shakespeare in Love"" featuring the life of a 1967 George Lucas in USC film school.  This film is less than 10 minutes long, but manages to cram joke after joke in, alluding  to many of the characters George Lucas has created for his films (not  limited to the STAR WARS films).
The filming, acting, and score is  superb.  My complaint is similar to others: it wasn't long enough.  I also  feel like the script could have used a little more polish.  However, this  short film is a fun and diverting fantasy, adding another dimension of  folklore to the layered theories surrounding the STAR WARS series and its  much-revered creator."
2724,615115187,5,this movie was simply breath takingnot only was it fnny but it inspiers if you never seen this movie yougot to by it
2725,615115187,5,"I loved this movie!  It's too bad it's so short!  My wife didn't get it -- she thought it was about the making of Star Wars, even though she made me watch Shakespeare in Love.  I have to watch Shakespeare in Love again just  to see how George Lucas in Love parodies it.  I can't believe it is a  student production because it is so sophisticated."
2726,615115187,5,THIS JUST IN: THE NOODLE HAS WON THE RACE!
2727,615115187,5,If you know your Star Wars characters and plots inside out this short movie is loaded with funny scenes relating to the SW films. But you have to pay attention - some clips are really short. And you will probably miss  something anyway (there is supposed to be a reference to Anakin somewhere  but I missed that apparently). If you are not into the SW movies this movie  is of no value to you.
2728,615115187,5,"For fans of Star Wars, this is an absolute must see!  Fans of Shakespeare in Love will roll when they see this movie, for the simple fact that they will pick up many of the subtleties of humor that us ""just plain""  Star Wars fans would probably miss.
For my own part, after reading the  reviews of this movie when in first came out, I went to the website and  watched the movie online before I bought it.  The blatant Star Wars  allusions -- from the asthmatic rival, to the not-so-subtle background  action -- are absolutely hysterical, but I knew that I was missing  something.  That night, I went to the video store and rented SIL just so I  could understand what it had to do with the parody.  I can now say with  absolute assurance that if you're a fan of both films, George Lucas in Love  will probably be the best parody you will ever see!
Oh... one more thing  -- if you watched this movie on the Web and thought it was hilarious, I  would still encourage you to buy it.  There is a surprise ending on the  video (not shown on the Internet version) that is, in my opinion, the best  moment in the whole film.  What is it, you ask?  Now now, you'll have to  buy it, and see for yourself!"
2729,615115187,5,"Props to the makers of this ingenious little movie.  To say anything is to give away all the gags, which are hilarious.  If you are a fan of Star Wars, there's really no reason not to love this short film.  My friend and  I about died laughing at some of the injokes.
I guess my only complaint  would be that I wish it were longer, to satisfy my thirst for more of this  movie."
2730,615115187,3,"A co-worker, a huge ""Star Wars"" fan, breathlessly brought this video to work and had me borrow it. ""It's so great!,"" he promised. Eh... My friends have made more effective nine minute movies, but  it's not hard to understand why this film sells so well -- there's an  endless supply of mythology for devotees of ""Star Wars,"" and this  movie exposes it, if not skillfully, at least blatantly. Few of the  so-called ""inspiration"" shots really work well -- Obi-Wan and  Jabba work because they're more subtle. The Darth Vader and R2D2/C3PO ones  stretch for believability -- I know there's weirdos at any university at  any time, but these caricatures try a little too hard as written (if what  I'm writing doesn't make sense, it's because I'm trying to not give the  movie away). Really good filmmakers (and remember that Nussbaum is still  new at this) don't pander in such obvious ways. Still, the acting's good,  it's reasonably well-made, and there's only nine minutes of it, so you  don't have too long to dwell on shortcomings anyway. Not a bad purchase for  ""Star Wars"" freaks."
2731,615115187,1,"First of all, anyone who gave this movie a 5 needs their head examined.  It's only 9 minutes long.  I understand it's a short, but that's a little riduculous considering it costs $12 to get it from Amazon.  That's $1.25 a  minute, for a movie that isn't funnier than anything I could think of.  And  why does his girlfriend have that hairdo?  They don't explain.  So I  suggest, you don't buy."
2732,615115187,5,"Several reviewers around here really seem to want a lot from a 9 minute film.
'George Lucas In Love' was a very fun short. From Lucas' roommate Benji talking about an 'all powerful force' to his friends Hal & Chuck  working on Hal's 'fastest thing on campus' to a professor whose speech  patterns resembled a well known Jedi Master, this film has a heck of a lot  crammed into it's 9 minutes.  If anything, the filmmakers should have done  a 15-20 minute film! The film was very clever and enjoyable. Maybe just a  tad bit funnier than 'Hardware Wars'.
The music, cinematography, and  acting are all very good, indeed.  Anyone who didn't enjoy this at least a  little really needs to get a sense of humor.  Of course, it's a bit cheesy,  but it's meant to be that way.  It's presented in the slightly corny,  overblown way that 'Hardware Wars' or the 'Naked Gun' films were. The same  people who didn't understand those films probably won't understand 'George  Lucas In Love'.  It's not a 'great' film, but who cares?  It's a fun little  short by a guy who really loves 'Star Wars'.  Some have condemned the  filmmakers doing this just for the money. I seriously doubt that Mr.  Nussbaum will make a huge fortune from this film and if he does, big deal.  Nothing wrong with making money from doing what you love or making money at  all. Surely, none of the people who reviewed this film would go and work at  their jobs for free and live in a cardboard box under a bridge somewhere!  Anyway, GLIL is great fun and a great to watch before your next screening  of 'Phantom Menace' or the original trilogy."
2733,615115187,5,Very Clever! Well Acted! A downright good time. Good god I sound like a jerk. But it was good.
2734,615115187,5,"You don't have to be a genius to understand the magic behind this video. You get to see in a, parotical sense, the experiances that inspired the work of George Lucas. Believe it or not, it's hilarious. Calling this movie a waste of money just tells us how dense you are. This Video Rocks!  END"
2735,615115187,1,"This short film is the biggest waste of money since Arnold's End of Days.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a HUGE Star Wars fan, but, unlike Anakin Skywalker, this short has no chance of redemption.  All it consists of are unimaginative impressions of ""real life"" Stat Wars characters  like a black-clad asthmatic film school rival, and an earmuff-coiffed love  interest.  The flick is over before it begins, lacks any kind of  unpredictable climax, and can be summed up in one word: Dumb."
2736,615115187,1,"this move is bad and not very good. i really don't think its worth the attention or the you know money. ha ha. i wish for all them to learn how to make moves that are worth the money. this is not. you know what i mean.?  anyweays, think before you buy. i don't like the stupid jokes about  charactars and stuff. where are teh ewoks?"
2737,615115187,5,"Great short film!  Well worth it...funny movie.  If you're a true Star Wars fan, then you shouldn't be without this in your collection!  A++"
2738,615115187,5,"A really good, short film full of excellent observations. Worth adding to any order. I hope this film maker can maintain the same humor-density in his further work."
2739,615115187,5,"Fans of the Star Wars movies will find a lot to laugh about (particularly if they are observant) during this short but extremely funny movie. For me, much of the humor came as the young George Lucas interacted with characters  and events in college that were strangely familiar....
Someone who isn't  a fan of the Star Wars universe (is there such a person?) won't get most of  the inside jokes and references to the movies, and some things will fly  over their heads entirely. But they should still find something to laugh  about.
The sound, visuals, and storyline are all extremely professional,  and it's refreshing to see something so witty and well-written come out of  a low-budget environment. The people that made this have a lot of talent."
2740,615115187,5,"I've been hoping I would see this in a hardback book version as well! Full of humor and information on THE MAN George Lucas, himself, his films, and his life.
Great for fans of all his works or just the Star Wars saga  fans!"
2741,615115187,5,"As far as comic shorts go, this one is a gem.  For those of you who find fault with story developement, originality, etc. (see other reviews here), I have this to say: it's a short film, not a feature film, and so by  defition it's not gonna give you what you can get in 120 minutes of screen  time.  But what Joe Nussbaum does in eight minutes puts to shame most of  the slop churned out in Hollywood.  It's probably harder to do something  good and funny in eight minutes than it is in a feature length film, and  this homage/spoof delivers the goods.  The details are dead on, the writing  is crisp and funny, the acting perfectly in tune with the spirit of the  project.  So everyone just relax and enjoy Lucas in Love for what it is."
2742,615115187,5,"Being a long time Star Wars fan, this was a hilarious film.  If you  haven't seen it I would recommend it to any one who has grown up with Star  Wars.
This was well directed for an independant short film.  You can see  how all of the people in the movie could have been inspirations for George  Lucas.
This is not a spoof of Star Wars, but rather a spoof of  ""Shakespeare in Love"", with a Star Wars theme to it.
I give  this one two thumbs up."
2743,615115187,3,"I first saw this film on the internet, like many other people. I found it to be very interesting for Lucas fanatics (like some of my good friends), but otherwise it is kind of dull, and needs a lot of fleshing out. And,  altought Lucas is obviously no Shakespeare (he will never be known as a  great writer), it is an interesting comparison / spoof. Well worth the  eight minutes."
2744,615115187,4,"Saw this orginally online and it spread like wildfire aroundthe office. Hysterical, with brilliant references and parodies. If itwas any more expensive I'd say pass but [at this price] you can't even buy a paperback. You get a few hours of fun as you play for every uninitiated person who visits your house."
2745,615115187,5,"...the result is hilarious!
An asthmatically sinister neighbor who sounds surprisingly similar to Darth Vader; a hairy friend who groans like Chewbacca; a college student who beeps and bleeps like R2D2 with his tall  friend who answers him like C-3PO; a girl with very interesting hair buns  on either side of her head, who is leading a rebellion; a teacher who talks  backwards, and just when he almost starts to make sense, he says, ""Too  much have I already said.""  They manage to cram all that and so much  more into 9 minutes of hilarious movie.  I especially like the twist at the  end (and you'll have to watch the movie to find out what it is). :-)
This  is the story of George Lucas' inspiration for writing ""Star Wars""  a la Shakespeare in Love.
This video is great!  It's also nice to watch  it on video, since in the past (before I got the video) I watched it  online, and every time, I ran into net congestion.  No net congestion with  a video. :-)"
2746,615115187,5,"This whitty and refreshingly original portrayal of the birth of the Star Wars series will not only be enjoyed by avid fans, but anyone who has seen the movies.  I do feel, however, the part of the young man who was working  on the car was drastically understated.  His charisma, sex appeal, and  talent  should be used to its fullest.  I can see him as a young  Doctor/Doogie Howser or a rebel leading some sort of coup.  Any directors  out there need to cast more of this young man.  I have thoroughly enjoyed  this movie and will continue to recommend it to anyone who brings up Star  Wars and George Lucas."
2747,615115187,5,"I saw this when it was originally distributed as quasi-samizdat, and it's great. The acting is quite fine with it being played totally straight. It's worth visualizing Shakespeare in Love and Star Wars briefly before watching  if only to help catch all the little jokes. Great casting."
2748,615115187,5,"This inspired parody is a classic, whether or not you are a SW fan.  The references are outstanding, including the one non SW reference that very few people seem to get.  The casting was phenomenal, the screen wipes an  expert touch and the cinematography very well done.  At 8 minutes long, it  is a perfect length for a short so as to grab your attention and let you  know that these young prodigies are capable of anything in the world.  Well  done, to all involved!"
2749,615115187,5,"Belle parodie,de la part de ces tudiants, de ce film culte qu'est STAR WARS.On peut tout particulirement fliciter l'interprte du futur  Chewbacca qui mriterait aussi bien l'Oscar pour ce film que Gwyneth  Paltrow pour SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE."
2750,615115187,5,"What most people don't see at first is how well Nussbaum captured the opening sequence from SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE and meddled it seemlessly with more STAR WARS riffs than a Pepsi commercial.
I've seen enough BAD  shorts in my time to know when someone really, truly puts in the effort to  make something special. Well executed and well directed, I'm sure Joe will  have fun with any movie endeavor he takes on in the future."
2751,615115187,4,"Very clever spoof of George Lucas, his movies and his many attributes.  Very subtle references to many of his movies and performed in a very witty manner.  Those who need this short film explained to them are clearly not a  fan of Mr. Lucas' films. The creater, director and stars of this short film  are just moments away from ""making it big""."
2752,615115187,5,"This is one of the most original and creative spoofs I have ever seen.  Who would have thought that Lucas was inspired in such wacky ways?  All true Star Wars fans should own their own copy of this film.  All true  Shakespeare in Love fans should own one too, for that matter.  I am looking  forward to seeing more from these guys!"
2753,615115187,5,"Independent Short films are not supposed to be this good, but an artistic and talented director can take a non-studio group of actors and a superb crew (editing, producing, and scoring in particular) and create something  truly incredible. The story-weaving is amazing, and feels like a true  post-modernist film rather than your basic satire. If I were a movie exec,  I'd be after Mr. Nussbaum in a second for a feature project! I look forward  to his studio directing debut. (Maybe Lucas will let him direct the next  Star Wars movie - Nussbaum would probably do a better job!)"
2754,615115187,5,"As with any short-subject work, you need to get right to the point in a hurry, without losing the viewer.  This leaves the viewer laughing, and eager to watch again and again. This will certainly join my video collection. The best!"

Reports are that so far this holiday season, online sales are up 20%, while bricks and mortar vendors are reporting barely any incresase at all.
Ms. Stevens not only tells you how to reduce your advertising costs on this medium, she presents it in the DVD format, which most of us find easier to comprehend than written book material. This is particularly true when she demonstrates actual examples of how to impliment the secrets she teaches us.
Her history as a coach diagramming plays on a blackboard obviously taught her how to get her points across in an understandable way. I'm looking forward to her next foray into this field."

I have spent literally thousands of dollars in years past for books and tapes and the like from seminars by experts in their respective fields. Never have I experienced the energy of Wendy Stevens. She held over two hundred people in captivated awe at her knowledge of her subject and her uncanny ability in driving it into our minds. For two whole days, this woman never stopped walking back and forth on the stage spouting statistics, dates, ratios, etc, without consulting a single note.  She answered specific questions and responded to all manner of questions from the rapt audience. I am still digesting the material by watching the DVDs over and over again. If anyone follows her wealth of knowledge on internet marketing and doesn't succeed in their campaigns, they simply didn't do it her way.  Her systems are spelled out in minute detail and are all based on her fantastic success in her chosen career. You will be hearing from Wendy Stevens again. As far as I am concerned, she is the final authority on Internet Marketing.

I can edit documents, send emails, open attachments and even fix a jammed printer.  But when I entered the field of internet marketing I didn't know that there was a whole university's worth of knowledge that I was missing!  But once I put in Wendy's DVD it was like plug and play. She did everything short of hold the mouse and guide the cursor for me! Oh wait - she did do that!  Even a child could get it in a heartbeat. - Step-by-step video presentation removed the content mystery for me and made internet marketing much more palpatable for me. I learned some basic and not so basic advertising concepts so that I could create more sharper target specific advertising.  Also, makes it possible for little guy to be seen.

2842,615544266,5,"This was such a memory enhancer from our days in South Korea teaching esl.  There was a lot of new information here, also.  We absolutely loved it, loved it, loved it!  This is very well done."
2843,615544266,4,"Caught this on PBS earlier this year and thought that this would be a perfect christmas gift for my mother who hasn't been back to Korea since we left a couple months after I was born. My mom did make fun of Marja from time to time when they went back to her kitchen in new york and tried to make the dishes, but she really did like it when they were in Korea and touring around the food markets and what not. For me, it was nice to see the bevy of different dishes she used to make for us when I was child (the seaweed soup was my favorite along with kimchi of course). She really enjoyed it b/c she lives with my dad nowadays in a place where there aren't any korean people and it was something that allowed her to see homeland which she really liked."
2844,615544266,5,"Exellent DVD with delicious recipes.
You must see this DVD. Try to know about Korean culture. It is very pleasant."
2845,615544266,5,"My girlfriend, who became interested in Korean food, caught some of Kimchi Chronicles on Public TV.  Suffice it to say, she had to have the series. What we received was not merely a foodie's delight, but an interesting melange of Korean history, personal journey, travel documentary, comedy, and, quite unexpectedly, hang out sessions with Hugh Jackman who serves, at times, as narrator as well as companion discovering Korean food. Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, who happens to be the host's husband, helps with some of the cooking. I found it particularly fascinating seeing him make observations about how Korean food  breaks the fundamental rules of his traditional French cuisine and somehow comes together in ways ways that his culinary training can't account for. You'll see Marja cooking with for her family and friends after visits to a variety of sites in Korea."
2846,615544266,5,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kimchi-Chronicles/dp/0615544266/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kimchi Chronicles</a>
This is a very entertaining series. I lived in Korea for 3 years and my wife is Korean and we love to watch these episodes. She literally gets hungry watching such great food being prepared and I enjoy the story lines that accompany each episode. I can relate to the bi-racial theme and think it is great to see such a wonderful global mix of cultures presented here."
2847,615544266,5,"cool show, lots of interesting foods and places, makes me want to go to south korea on a food quest just like her"
2848,615544266,5,"I love this series, it made me hungry for Korean food. I wanted to make some of the dishes on the show and I wanted to go to the places Marja went to. If you want to visit Korea, watch this series 1st and write down all the places in the show, to give you ideas of where to go and eat. It's a must."
2849,615544266,3,"The product outer packaging gave no indication that the product itself was defective. Upon playing both dvd's, they were either skipping ahead or just totally stopped playing. I had wanted to get a replacement, but was informed that only a refund would be given. I promptly returned the item & was given a credit within a couple of days."
2850,718003373,5,"I don't know why people like The gospel of John better.  I never had.  Matthew is so much better.  I saw an edited version of Matthew on tbn in '94 and thought it was great. and bought the 4 tape vhs in '96.  and got the dvd in 2000. Matthew portrayel of Jesus was unlike any portrayel I ever saw before.  from his tender compassion to jolly sense of humor to his serious side.  Bruce does a great job of acting.  A must see.

but when John came out in '03, it wasn't anything like Matthew.  I was highly disappointed.  He wasn't half as jolly as Bruce.  I guess I was expecting something like Matthew."
2851,718003373,5,"This approach to Matthews's Gospel was superbly done.  The original text is used unexpurgated, but with the entire story acted out in full colour.  Anyone thinking of starting to take an interest in the Bible would be very well advised to buy this DVD.  And if you are sufficiently enthralled, there is a similar one based on the book of Acts."
2852,718003373,5,We are using this for our small group study and the visual interpretation along with the word for word translation make this an exceptional learning tool.
2853,718003373,4,"Hi...My mother first got this when i was about 14. I was touched on how good this was done by the actors. I am now 20 years old and i am living on my own, and this is a MUST HAVE. Too bad it's sold out on here becuase i would have bought this on here. Bruce has touched my life in many ways, and so has this film. Watch this for yourself and you yourself may incounter that the word of god is the most powerful words written in the world. Thanks visual bible!

God's Blessings to all who seek the word of God

David"
2854,718003373,5,"I thorougly enjoyed the Book of Matthew not only because it followed the NIV transalation word for word but the portrayal of Jesus was superb!  I've never seen a more human example of Jesus Christ.  He was playful, full of joy, and compassionate.  This is a MUST SEE!  The Falling Fire movie was also good but more of a dramatic portrayal than a word for word account."
2855,718003373,5,"Outstanding Performance by Bruce Marchiano& Richard Kiley. Jesus is Incredibly Loving and kind. One is drawn to Him(Jesus) by His love and compassion. The healing scenes are very moving. I do believe that Jesus was just as Excited as those who were healed because He loved meeting the needs of people and showing His love. His non-verbal communication of Joy shouted His Love to People. His message is Love. How can we help but love Him and Give Him our all. Yes Bruce Marchiano captured the Love of Christ to us, manifest by ""The Joy of the Lord"". Richard Kiley is also marvelous in his role as narrator and Tax Collector Matthew. Outstanding Film ...It will touch your heart with the love and Joy of the Lord!"
2856,718003373,5,"Having not seen the dvd before buying it (a friend recommended it) all I can say is WOW. An incredible portrayal of someone who would have attracted the crowds that the actual Jesus did. It was a pleasure to witness a Jesus that was not somber, depressing or scary as in so many other movies about Jesus. As a preacher of the Gospel, I will show this again and again to whomever will give me the time to do so. You can follow along in your bible as it gives the verse reference for every word in the bottom right of the screen. Five stars is not enough for this movie. I cant wait to receive the Acts dvd that I just ordered."
2857,718003373,5,"The Matthew film has made a huge impact on my vision of the personality and character of Jesus.  This film is word for word to the NIV translation of the Gospel of Matthew, and shows the chapters and verses in the lower corner of the screen.  There are no added stories, characters, or words; but all of the emotions are expressed to their fullest which gives you a great understanding and meaning behind what is being said.  It identifies a very approachable and caring Jesus figure.  This film has inspired everyone I have shown it to (and I have shown it to many).  In my personal opinion, the character of Jesus that is portrayed in this film, matches the Gospel more than any other movie I have ever seen about Jesus.  This video has given me a great picture to go with the words written in the Bible and has helped me get a better understanding of what I am reading.  I highly recommend this and all the other films made by The Visual Bible; they really do an outstanding job of adding personality to the characters.  I am convinced that this is very close to the way it really happened (besides being white and speaking english of course;)  I hope this review helped!"
2858,718003373,5,"Using the NIV text as the basis, these DVD's are a film recording of the gospel of Matthew.  All the dialog, narration, everything is directly from the Bible.
The wonder of these videos, however, is the fact that they are able to make you think.  While sticking so closely to the Bible and with well researched visuals, the producers, directors, and actors give their own interpretation of the story, which allows you to open your eyes to something new.  The best example of this is Bruce Marchiano's portrayal of Jesus.  Instead of the solemn, serious person you usually picture, here we see a person who enjoyed life, laughed, and had some fun in between dealing with the serious issues of life.  When I first watched these videos, it made me look at my preconceived ideas of God very differently.
While expensive, these DVD's are worth checking out for a different perspective on a familiar tale."
2859,736925856,5,This DVD was very interesting. The rapture could be happening anytime now. Israel is preparing for the new temple to be built. You must watch this DVD and show it to your church or Bible study.
2860,736925856,5,Love anything about Israel and the Word of Yeshua.
2861,736925856,4,Well written with contemporary points as well as biblical and historical references.  Brings up points that are important to consider today.
2862,736925856,5,"An amazing book dealing with Bible Prophecy and current events. These two authors continue to produce excellent commentary on how news headlines fall into line with the predictions of the prophets as guided by God in His Holy Word. This book quotes middle east and U.S. leaders to show that Israel and Jerusalem remain the very center of the universe in God's plan for His earth. The book is very well written as expected from Dr. Ankerberg and easily understod. Many relative questions are answered in the last chapters, also."
2863,736925856,2,"John Ankerberg and Jimmy DeYoung come together to create ""Israel Under Fire: The Prophetic Chain of Events That Threatens the Middle East,"" a book that promises to explain the Biblical predictions concerning the current events in Israel, how what happens in Israel affects the rest of the world, and answers the age old question, ""Will there ever be peace in the Middle East."" To come to these answers Ankerberg and DeYoung interview - on location in Israel and the Middle East - many of the policy makers and experts who would be close to the situation, such as, Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel and Reuven Rivlin, the Speaker of the Knesset in Israel.

Ankerberg and DeYoung are less authors than interviewers for much of the book (and interviewees, as I will explain.) The authors claim that the book will answer questions and give a biblical basis for the current events in Israel. To accomplish these goals the authors provide a brief history how the modern state of Israel came to be, what exactly is currently happening in Israel. On these points, I found that the authors were successful. Unfortunately, this was only the one part of the book.

In the second part of the book, the authors interview current world leaders and here is where I feel the books goes awry. I had two issues here. First, the authors advertise on the back cover that they interview Adnan Husseini, Yasser Arafat's cousin and Palestinian Authority spokesman.' It is true. But this is a little misleading as he is one of three world leaders advertised yet he appears in only one very short section with only a couple of questions, while the others leaders, Jewish pundits exclusively, are interviewed extensively. This is far from balanced coverage.

Second, the authors didn't just interview pundits they agreed with - they also interviewed each other. I understand that the authors may be experts in a field but their opinions should be bolstered by other expert's opinions, statistics, reports and the like. Author's opinions should not be proved by their own opinions. The issue of lack of documentation and proof isn't just relegated to their opinions in interviews. Unfortunately, the authors take comments and opinions from pundits they agree with for granted, moving right past controversial quotes that cry out for data that reinforces the opinion. The only reference in the book to an outside source (other than the Bible) is on page 156 (of 174).

In the third section of the book, the authors attempt to tie current events with Biblical prophecy. I would expect that anyone, after reading this book, even someone who has no experience with Biblical prophecy or current events, would be able to walk away understanding the ""prophetic chain of events that threaten the Middle East."" What I found in this section, though, was confusion. To explain a complicated book like Revelation, I would expect we would start at the beginning and work our way through the (purported) time line from start to finish. I would expect that current events would be tied in to the timeline to show how the events fit into the puzzle. I would expect that the authors would show how these events work together to fulfill prophecy. Unfortunately, Ankerberg and DeYoung did not make a convincing connection for me.

While I did find the first section of the book interesting, this book left me unsatisfied in my search for connections between current events and Biblical prophecy. Revelation itself is already difficult to understand and I found the authors didn't accomplish their goal of making it accessible and understood by the novice.

As much as I would have liked to, I cannot recommend this book to anyone but the expert Bible prophecy student.

2865,736928936,5,"I was so excited to see this new Bible Study from Lysa TerKeurst. I LOVED Made to Crave and was thrilled to see not only a new book by Lysa, but also an Interactive Workbook and a 6 part DVD series called ""What Happens When Women Say Yes to God""!

I received the the DVD series and the workbook in the mail to review from Harvest House Publishers.

This is a wonderful series speaking exactly to where women are today. We do need to be willing to say Yes to God!

One of my favorite phrases from this study is, ""When the Messiah touches our mess, it becomes our message to the world.""

We all have a story, a mess that God has or can touch and He wants us to say YES, to allow Him to use those things in our lives for His glory.

Such a powerful word from Lysa!

The description of the workbook says, ""Excellent for individuals or groups, this workbook companion to the DVD helps women discover and delight in God's joy and purpose for their lives."" It does that through personal questions, activities and discussions. There are a few lessons in the workbook to go with each session which allows you to dig deeper into what Lysa taught during the week's DVD session.

I am excited to use this material in my women's Sunday School class and give them the opportunity to go through this study again with me!"

2871,736928936,5,"I bought this to use in my small group at church, as well as the book.  The DVD and the participants guide is all that is needed for an amazing study, but the addition of the book takes you deeper.  We all loved it and felt like it was well worth the money and time invested."
2872,736928936,4,I would like to sell all the materials back as we have decided t do a different study  in our fellowship
2873,736928936,5,"I have yet to finish this but I was very please with the book, CD and workbook.  I am looking forward to going through it.  Thank you for the prompt service."
2874,736928936,5,"Our ladies Bible study group found this study a challenge to our faith.  Hearts were touched and our faith was stretched.  We hope to continue saying ""yes"" to God.  There is a text book and a study book to accompamy the dvd."
2875,736928936,4,"A group of ladies from church are having this Women's Bible study in our home. The facilitators purchased the study guide, and DVD set, and book for each of them. The rest of the ladies just are either using the book or ebook version for the study.  This is a group of 8-11 women who are using it as a summer study and reading a few chapters each week, watching the video, and then discussion from the study guide has helped the group to grow closer to God and each other.
  The DVD has been pretty good, but the audio quality is sometimes lacking.  I would recommend this for those who want to say Yes to God."
2876,738920444,3,"Ok it did get into a little more detail, but the commercial says its not censored, it still is you don't see anything more than what you've already seen on tv... dissapointing."
2877,738920444,4,"I liked this video.  However, if ones intentions for buying it were to see/hear uncensored aspects of show (nudity/swearing)- you will be really disappointed.  It is very censored.  But if you are interested in seeing  some hysterically amusing previously unseen on tv parts of the show (What  was it really like?  What did they think of this?  What was really going  on with those two?  etc) - I think the video will be worth the price.  Basically, after watching the tape, I felt like I understood more about  what was going on and I was rolling on the floor laughing at the same time."
2878,738920444,3,Real World is Awesome. You get up close and personal with these seven strangers. I can't wait till next season to see what MTV and Real World have in store for us viewers. Keep up the great work MTV.....
2879,738920444,5,"This is probably one of the best MTV Real World tapes that are out.  Colin is absolutely hysterical, as well as easy on the eyes.  The only thing that is a bit misleading is the ""uncensored"" comment they make about  the tape.  Everyone still has those fuzzy bars blocking all the important  parts, and the ""bad words"" are bleeped-but, the tape is great!  Buy it!"
2880,738920444,1,"This is nothing but stuff that fell on the cutting room floor that didn't make the MTV edit. It's a waste of time and money. If you want to get close to the cast members, move to Hollywood. They're all over this place. And  they think they're real actors. Ha!"
2881,738920444,1,"What a waste. This video is completely censored. Not worth the money. Rent, don't buy."
2882,738920444,1,"Here they are, the Insufferable Seven in all their uncensored glory. And  guess what? They're exactly the same uncensored as they are when their  a**es are blurred and their obscenities are beeped.
It is kind of funny  that these would-be exhibitionists--especially Teck, Kaia and  Ruthie--didn't sign nudity releases, and so the scenes of them cavorting  nude are still blurred out. How does Kaia expect to get a modeling contract  if she doesn't show some T? Some A? From her riveting personality? And  while on the nudity subject, it's more than a little disingenuous for Colin  to eschew the girls' nudity when he's never got a shirt covering up his  studly chest.
The only fun thing about this video is that Justin--that  pretentious, cigarette-smoking, pseudo intellectual creep--gets sent up  very effectively. The producers do have the last laugh on him. From his  phony double talk to his failure to flush before he flees, he'd no doubt be  mortified to see how he really comes across.
The video is organized  ""thematically,"" so there is a ""bloopers"" section (NOT  funny), a nudity section (censored), a bodily functions section (Teck and  Colin farting), and so on. There is no ""narrative"" to speak of,  none of the stories are forwarded the way they were episodically in the  regular season.
What would have been MUCH more interesting, if the  producers wanted to really provide something that we couldn't get watching  on TV, would have been a video showing the cast members' reactions to  having their foibles broadcast on national television. None of what we  watch on TRW is in real time, it all happened 5 months ago. I would have  loved to see Amaya's embarrassment while witnessing her own ill-fated Colin  obsessing. I'd love to see Kaia realizing she's not going to get a modeling  contract. I'd love to see Matt cringe as he watches himself ministering to  Ruthie's every alcoholic whim.
Soon, these people will (like Justin did  before them) be dropping off the national radar screen, never to be heard  from again. Rumor has it that Colin has been offered a TV pilot, and if the  cute factor alone can get him a ""showbiz"" career, more power to  him; one doubts it, though. He's old news."
2883,738920444,1,"UNCENSORED ????? Baloney, the producers should be sued for false advertising. If you are buying to ""see what you won't see"" on MTV, forget it. If you are buying it because you just can't get enough of  the show - get a life."
2884,738920444,2,"The box says 100%uncovered, what a big lie! I thought it would be uncensored. It's the same stuff that you would see on regular TV. Don't waste your money on this."
2885,738920444,1,"I wonder where the producers got the idea that this was a cast that really likes each other, or that this is the most interesting cast yet.  Haven't they realize that people watch just to feel better about THEMSELVES?  Is  there anyone who DOESN'T laugh at these people?"
2886,738921467,4,"My son is 23 months old and LOVES Oscar the Grouch.  I searched through the Sesame Street videos to find one in which Oscar was the primary character (my son also really likes Telly monster)- and this one features  both.  The ""movies"" that are reviewed by Oscar and Telly are not  some of 'Sesame Street's' greatest, but on the whole, it's a cute video,  and good for some laughs from the little people."
2887,738921467,4,"I never saw this special during my childhood, which in retrospect was really too bad. Now that I have a four year old son, I love finding ""pre-Elmo"" Sesame Street productions for him to watch. This is a fun special - In a nutshell, thanks to Big Bird, the Sesame Street folks find themselves locked overnight in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. At this point, various characters start having their own adventures: Oscar becomes enamored with the museum's collection of ancient Greek statues, believing them to be beautiful ""trash"" because they are missing limbs, noses, heads, etc.; Bob is forced to thwart Cookie Monster's desire to eat a painting by Paul Cezanne and other works of art; Super Grover tries to make friends with a suit of armor, thinking that it's a real person; and Big Bird along with Mr. Snuffleupagus help a 4006 and one-half year old, cursed Egyptian boy (who presumably lives by day as a mummy in the museum) solve an ancient riddle so that he can transform into a star and live with his parents in the night sky.
Admittedly, the Egyptian portion of the special is a bit odd; they continually make reference to the ""demon"" (played by actor James Mason) that arrives at stroke of midnight to pose the riddle's question to the Egyptian boy, as well as Osiris (the god of the underworld) who poses the final challenge to the boy's ascension. I thought this segment was great, but I never thought I would hear the word ""demon"" uttered by Big Bird - Maybe they should start having him call Elmo a ""little red demon!"" (Just Kidding).
As with nearly everyone else who reviewed this special, I really wish that it was available on DVD. However, if I must purchase a used VHS copy, I will do so."
2888,738921467,5,"I have this on vhs.  Now, I don't even have a player for it.  My kids loved this.  Now, I want my grandson to see it.  Can't someone release it on dvd?"
2889,738921467,5,"i love this movie, i rem. it from when i ws a kid. i wish it was on dvd so i could buy it. my girls would love this movie!!!"
2890,738921467,5,"This one should be reissued in DVD. I am a grandmother and remembered how much my children, one of which is now a professional artist, loved this. I was not wrong. My three year old granddaughter requests to see it everyday over many other choices when she comes to visit. She is frightened by the wizard and cried when Sahu goes to his parents; she didn't understand why he went away, but would just come get us to sit with her for that part. She is still requesting it a year later. I have memorized the songs. As with so many others brought to you by Sesame Street it is treasure for all ages."
2891,738921467,5,My title says it all. It is a wonderful way for parents to introduce the cultural aspect into their childrens' world
2892,738921467,5,"I have not seen this in YEARS, yet it is still fresh in my mind.  I just bought it off the Met website and am going to look into converting it to DVD.  I am 22, and I want to be able to show this to my children.  It is still probably one of my favorite movies (well, more of an hour long show) of all time, topping many things considered ""grown up"".  There really is no children's programming like this anymore.  Get it while you can."
2893,738921467,5,"Best Sesame Street movie ever. It started my love for all things Egyptian, and for museums! I now work in one, and on my days off, I travel around going to other museums! This movie sparked my obsession. It is educational, and something no child will forget!"
2894,738921467,5,"I am one of those kids who grew up watching this video. Nineteen years  after first seeing the video, I went as a college student last for the first time to the Met, taking snapshots of all of the important artifacts from ""Don't Eat The Pictures"".
  Oddly enough, I really believe that this movie was a large contributing factor to my choice of archaeology as a career. This movie is a classic. It encourages real world participation and is still able to make me laugh. As soon as I have children, this will be the first video that they ever watch."
2895,738921467,5,"I first saw this film back in 1983. I must have been about seven. I remember when it first premiered on PBS (Channel 11 in Chicago, where I grew up). My sister and I were allowed to stay up late on a Sunday night just to watch it. Then I didn't see it again for many years until I found it for sale on Amazon.

It's such a cute video. The adults of Sesame Street take Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Grover, and some of the kids to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC. Just as the museum is about to close, Big Bird says that Snuffy was supposed to meet him. Of course this draws a lot of moans and groans from the adults, as Snuffy wouldn't make his debut for two more years. Big Bird sneaks away to find Snuffy just as the museum is closing! It becomes a game of cat and mouse as the night guard is sure that something weird is going on and the gang just slips by him. But the biggest story is that Snuffy and Big Bird meet an ancient Egyptian prince named Sahou. Sahou has been trying to get into Heaven for 3,000 years but he can't because he can't answer a riddle. Big Bird and Snuffy come to the rescue to come up with the answer.

There are also some cute little songs in here, like ""Mothers and Children,"" sung by Olivia, ""Don't eat the Pictures,"" done by Cookie Monster and the Girls, and ""You'll get Home Soon,"" by Big Bird and Sahou. I liked this video and I plan to share it with my own children someday because it opens up the world of art appreciation to them. Very well done. And no Elmo!"
2896,738921467,1,"I ordered this because I had seen (but, alas, not bought at the time) ""The Best of Sesame Street"" in a store and the 3 items included were great old ones.  On Amazon, there was no picture of the set's box, and the description did not list the DVDs included.  It turned out to be three nondescript, uninteresting DVDs in a box that was not like the box I saw in the store.  I returned it, but they charged me shipping and handling, and I was out the time and effort.  The return process gave no way to explain the problem.

Be aware that you're ordering a pig in a poke."
2897,738921467,5,"Loved it then and still loving it now!  Only wish it was on dvd and that

the songs would become available on cd!"
2898,738921467,5,"As a kid, I used to watch Sesame Street, a show that was by then a classic. My parents bought this film from the library and my sister and I watched it constantly. My dad still remembers songs from the film and my sister and I reminisce about it.

The plot of the story is that the kids and the puppets get locked into a museum overnight. They get to tour the area without being bothered by others. Oscar the Grouch sings a song about wonderful trash, referring to the broken statues all around him. Cookie Monster sings the title song when he gets hungry from looking at still life paintings all night. Big Bird and Snuffy find an Egyptian Prince and attempt to help him become a star in the sky like his parents. Everything that happens is entertaining and educational.

Not only does this film address a side of schooling that isn't always addressed in schools, art, it is a great way for parents to spend time with their children and help them to grow."
2899,738921467,1,"1 star is too high for this.  It should be rated ""Stay away, it's horrible"". This movie is the epitome of false advertising.  The name is misleading and the video is misleading.  It's not really about the MET at all.  There are token amounts of the museum in it, but it's primarily about showing kids evil, demons, and how to become a star in the night sky.  This is really satanic and is inexcusable to foist this on unsuspecting children (and parents)."
2900,738921467,4,"I looked up a description of this set at Barnes and Noble.com, and as it turns out this set is just a compliation of three other sets: Elmopalooza, Do the Alphabet, and The Best of Elmo (telling me that apparently the best of Sesame Street is very Elmo-centric).  Personally I was trying to find some of those classic comedy routines I remember from when I was a kid, like Ernie calling to the fish (Here fishy fishy fishy). But I'm giving it four stars since I'm sure the material on here is perfectly good, even if I'm not personally interested."
2901,738921467,5,"I've been looking for this movie on DVD for quite some time.  This is one of my absolute favorite muppet movies, let alone Sesame Street. What I love about Sesame Street, the Sesame Street I grew up with anyways, is that little kids love it and it is educational, but there are enough jokes that parents can laugh and enjoy it as well.  This movie is no exception. I'm 20, and first saw it when I was 4 or 5.  It still holds up and is just as great as I remember."
2902,738921467,1,"Common, Amazon... there isn't even enough information here to make a purchase!  What DVDs are included in this ""Best of Sesame Street"" set?  And no picture, either?  :("
2903,738921467,5,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about this movie. I believe that every child should see this movie. Not only did it foster my love for all things Ancient Egyptian, it introduced art to me in such a wonderful way. My parents always remember how they took me to the Met and i shouted ""SAHU"" into every corridor searching for the little prince. If you are a parent PLEASE buy this for your child, they will thank you for years to come!!!"
2904,738921467,4,"I wish CTV would consider reissuing ""Sesame Street"" as a chronological series, starting with ""Season One,"" and working their way to the present... I would love to see the old episodes as they were originally broadcast, not with a few select bits chopped up into the new, modern mix.  The old shows were so wonderful... and that awful, whiny Elmo was nowhere to be seen!"
2905,738921467,5,"This is my favorite Seame Street Video.  I have always like the way Big Bird ans Snuffy helped Prince Sau.  It is a great way to show kids about ancient Egypt.  It is out of print because it has David who is not on the show anymore.  I wis they would put it on DVD because I know kids today would enjoy it reguardless.

It is funny whe Cookie Monster sings the Don't eat the pictures song after wanting to eat all of the food pictures after being stuck in the museum all night.

This is a great way for kids to learu about Museums.

 Sesame Street Fan For Life!!!!"
2906,738921467,5,Why is this costing $50-$75 here?  Go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art website and get it for $12.95.
2907,738921467,5,"We bought this video in 1996 for our first child and we are now using it for our third.  This is a wonderful video, probably the best in our collection.  It is calming and sweet but also entertaining.  It works too...it always calms them down and puts the baby to sleep.  Our oldest, now nine, still enjoys watching it, and the two younger ones (1 and 4) share a room and both really enjoy it.  The songs are nice and the skits are fun but calming.  My favorite part is the moon and sky story, but I also like the rest of the video as well.  It is calming to hear in the background, because I know soon they will be asleep!"
2908,738921467,5,"This movie is fantastic.  It is the first appearance of Snuffleupagus, which is great, because as a little kid, I kept on insisting that I could see him too and my mom was starting to worry!  You can still purchase this movie in the Metropolitan Museum gift shop or on their website [...] if you have trouble finding it.  I wish they would release it on DVD.  I strongly urge anyone to find this movie anyway they can.  Adults and kids alike will enjoy it for years to come."
2909,738921467,5,"Weve had this tape since the 80's. We have raised 4 kids with it, now my 15 year old wants it because she loved it so much."
2910,738921467,5,"My almost-4-year-old really gets a big kick out of this tape, as does her little 1 1/2 year old sister. It's amusing for them because it features some really silly short films and cartoons. It's amusing for me because of the Siskel and Ebert-style format with Oscar and Telly. It's one tape I don't mind playing for them frequently because It appeals to me as well."
2911,738921467,5,"You cannot go wrong with this bundle. I grew up in the 70's and 80's watching Sesame Street. My son has been watching Sesame Street since he was 11 months old and has learnt so much from the shows. We are fortunate in Australia the show is aired weekdays, the only down side is we only have a few of the dvd's available to purchase. So I didn't hestitate in purchasing them from ""AMAZON"". You won't be disappointed, this is children's viewing at it's best, and you too will enjoy watching Elmo and friends on Sesame Street."
2912,738921467,5,"My daughter loves Sesame Street, so we picked up this video on a whim.  Great purchase!  At 20 months old, she says her alphabet and counts to 15.  It's not just number recognition, either -- she counts items on pages of books and groups of toys.  She loves Ernie and Baby Bear, and loves to sing along and dance to the songs.  We're very pleased!"
2913,738921467,5,"Sesame Street specials are always wonderful, but this hour long movie, filmed when Sesame Street was in its prime, is just spectacular.  It remains one of my favorite ways to cheer myself up (I'm 27).  When Big Bird wanders off near closing time to meet Snuffleupagus, and the rest of the Sesame Street monsters and humans try frantically to find him, they all get locked overnight in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  The rest of the video, which amounts to the bulk of the story, revolves around three main storylines:  1.)  everyone trying to find Big Bird while avoiding the suspicious but clueless mustachio-ed museum security guard, 2.)  everyone discovering and enjoying the museum in the process, and 3.) Big Bird and Snuffleupagus helping a little Egyptian boy named Sahu prove his inner worth in a yearly ""test"", so that the god Osiris will let him join his parents as stars in the sky.  There is enough of a storyline to ensnare even those with the shortest of attention spans, children and adults alike, and quite a bit of comic relief to lighten the way.  Watching straight-arrow Bob as he runs around trying to keep Cookie Monster from scarfing down the Still Lives, while a group of dancing Monster-ettes sings the doo-wop title tune: ""Don't eat the pictures, no, no, no!"", is particularly amusing;  as are the scenes where Sahu's invisible cat, who still meows audibly, befuddles that poor hapless security guard.  The many many shots of the Museum interior are gorgeous, and a magical exposure/introduction to art and museums, in particular the paintings, sculpture, and medieval artifacts of the Met.  The video of course has a happy ending, but one that will bring tears to your eyes.  I watched this tape for the first time when I was 7 years old, and I must say that when as an adult I had my first opportunity to go to the Met in person, it was a truly awesome visit.  Another friend who had watched the movie as a child led me on what we called the Don't Eat the Pictures Tour, and she showed me every piece of art showcased in the movie.  Her tour ended at the Temple of Dendur itself, and as it was near closing time, it was dark outside with stars in the sky--just like the penultimate scene of DETP.  A memorable day, and a memorable movie.  It's a true gift from the Sesame Street gang to us, the viewing public.  You and your kids will love it."
2914,738921467,5,"(Althought the titles differ, I believe this is the same as Sleepy Time Songs and Stories.)
We watch this about once a week (too often and we all get bored, no?) and every time it calms my 2 year-old who then goes to sleep quickly and soundly.  The songs are lovely and there is a delightful story about how the sun and the moon came to live in the sky which is narrated by Ozzie Davis.  The last song is a drift-y, dreamy sequence with balloons - a nice ending.
This does not have the usual frenetic Sesame Street pace/quality but is rather sweet and very relaxing.  Bert, Ernie, Cookie Monster, Big Bird, etc.  (no Elmo).  Excellent!
We mix this goodnight video up with Kipper, Little People, Goodnight Moon and Maisy.  Sweet dreams!"
2915,738921467,4,"Parents,
I have not watched this tape that much but on Sesame Street Grover wants to be someone else. So all Grovers friends on Sesame Street cheer him up and show him how good he is. This is a great video for you and friends to watch."
2916,738921467,3,"Parents,
This is a video tape with some comic mocvies for kids in it. My 8 year old loves Cookie Monster so I try to find video tapes that inclued him. Keep in mind you will think this is fummy to."
2917,738921467,5,"Parents,
In this rare Sesame Street video they go to the Metropolitan Museum Of Art. My 8 year old boy loves Coookie Monster so I tried to find a tape that included him. Big Bird goes gets Suffy to leave the museum but when he comes back to all his friend they were stuck in the museum. Cookie Monster sees a picture but Cookie Monster sings a song to don't eat the pictures."
2918,738921467,5,I purchased Do The Alphabet for my boy/girl twins when they were 6 months old and they've been mesmerized by it since.  They are now 20 months old and are beginning to say the words of the alphabet song along with Big Bird and Baby Bear.  I think that this video and some of our other Sesame Street videos (like The Alphabet Jungle Game) have helped them begin to recognize and be able to say the letters sooner.  They are particularly fascinated with Baby Bear.  I would highly recommend this one!
2919,738921467,5,My son who is 8 months old has watched this ABC video since he was 2 months old.  He still loves it and he now swings his arms and kicks his legs while watching it in his toddler chair.  I have the words memorized and if I sing him the ABC's his face lights up immediately!  Hopefully he's learning the alphabet!
2920,738921467,4,"The best way to help your child learn the alphabet or numbers is to work with them one on one with books and letter shapes.  However, these videos are a fun way to reinforce what you're teaching them.
My two-year-old son will easily watch one of these videos all the way through, dancing and ""singing"" along.  He can almost make it through both of them back to back, which is quite high praise for a video from a toddler!
I must admit that Baby Bear has never been one of my favorite Sesame Street characters.  He *seems* older than a little baby, and his ""mispwonunciations"" a la Elmer Fudd grate on my ears.  But he is the character who is being taught the alphabet in ""A,B,C"", not the one doing the teaching, so he doesn't bother me as much.  He goes to Big Bird for help learning the alphabet.  Big Bird is the teacher who uses various cartoon clips and live action bits to illustrate the entire alphabet and most of the letters individually.  Please note I say ""most""--Baby Bear already knows A, B, and C, for instance, so although they are mentioned in passing they are not featured.  Also, a lot of verbs are used for illustration (J is for Jiggling, Jumping, and Jogging, for instance).  Because children usually learn nouns before verbs this makes some letters a bit less meaningful than others.  But don't get me wrong--there is plenty of singing and dancing and the entire alphabet is repeated multiple times.  My son loves to hear the Sesame Street gang sing the ABCs!
""1,2,3"" is the video that inspired me to buy this tape.  My son saw it at a friend's house and was captivated.  In this case, each number between one and twenty is featured in at least a small sketch or song.  The plot focuses on Ernie who finds a hotel room key and then proceeds to teach the managers how counting can help them do their jobs.  It, too, is great fun.
In short, buy the video for your preschooler, but don't rely on it alone to team him or her the alphabet or numbers."
2921,738921467,4,"My son is four and in Pre-K 4.  His teacher told me he was falling behind because he couldn't recognize the numbers.  Well,  I started searching around for learning tools for counting and I found this set of tapes.  I got them and started playing them for my son and they are really catchy tunes.  He has improved 100%."
2922,738921467,5,"My daughter is two years olds. She loves these vidoes , escpecially the ernie 123. She can now count to 20 just from watching the video. The ABC vidoe has also helped her learn the ABC song. She has been watching and loving these vidoes since she was 14 months old. I don't like the way baby bear speaks in the abc vidoe, its confusing for little kids. The text and the adventure is simple enough for toddlers to enjoy, and not too annoying for parents to watch along."
2923,738921467,5,"Because it certainly desrves it. Unlike today's emphasis on dumbing down programing ala Barney, this video tape was made in a time when children were actually respected and given enormous respect.
Granted some of the acting seems weird because of the programing shift, but I seriously doubt that it would scare today's little kids. I watched it as a little girl, and keep hoping that it will be released.
One of the unexpected side effects of this non-condescending treatment is that young adults such as myself still fondly remember this movie and are not at all bored by the pace. Whatever your chronological age, you will find this program timeless in it's appeal and beloved by all.
That is what indicates real staying power, not how many toys one can invent, market and make profit from."
2924,738921467,5,"My 20 month old son absolutely loves this video. There are 5 or 6 songs in the hour long video, which he has fun dancing to. It has all of the favorite Sesame Street characters that he recognizes from the television show. I like the video because it introduces our kids to art in all its forms. This show is a hit in our house and I am sure it will be in yours too."
2925,738921467,4,"It is amazing how my 23 month-old girl quickly learned how tranquilizing and ""soothing"" this video is! She goes to her bed and waits for Big Bird to announce his methods of falling asleep... By the time the Count  counts sheep, she's sound asleep! This video is just the right one for  kids' bedtime!"
2926,738920061,4,"We've seen virtually every Sesame Street video - some once, some many times.  This one is one of the most enjoyable.  We owned it for a long time, then my kids outgrew it - or so we thought!  They've asked to see it several times since we gave away our copy, so we keep getting it out of the library.  My kids are 7 and 10 now, and still asking!  We are particularly fond of 'Telly's Lunch' and the skit with Grover.  This is one of the really good Sesame Street videos - definitely worth the $ - only wish we'd kept our copy when we had a chance!  Four stars because nothing is better than Elmo's Sing Along Guessing Game, but this is VERY close."
2927,738920061,5,"My 2 1/2 year old son and 1 1/2 year old daughter love watching this video!  It also contains fun references for the parents that the kids won't necessarily pick up on (i.e. Cereal Girl is a spoof on the song Material Girl).  We got this video to use as part of my son's food therapy - he has oral sensory issues and is extremely selective about what he will eat.  Time will tell if this helps with his food therapy, but it is definitely entertaining - he is already singing some of the songs and giggles when Grover acts silly."
2928,738920061,5,"This Sesame DVD has to be my favourite! And believe me, we have them ALL. I love the songs, which will have you singing long after the dvd is over. Very cute skits and characters, Grover is very lovable. The underlying message is eating healthy but kids will enjoy the music and skits so much they won't notice there is a great message as well! We liked this so much that we bought it for my now 7 year old twins years ago and have now bought it again for my 2 year old."
2929,738920061,5,"We love this video!
We watch it over and over again. My son has always been a picky eater and this video has truly helped him to venture into trying new foods."
2930,738920061,5,"I enjoyed this video more than I thought I would.  I don't know what my daughter will think of it (she's too young to watch it now), but I really bought it for myself.  I grew up on Sesame Street and although this is not like the traditional Sesame Street, the same loveable characters are there.  I've always had an interest in food and especially love seeing talking, singing animated/puppet food -- this did not disappoint!  Grover tries to stress the importance of trying new foods and Cookie Monster has a rap song about vegetables (because he wants to be clear that one should not just eat cookies).  I liked it so much that I want to watch it again!"
2931,738920061,5,"My daughter is only 9 months old, but on both occasions that we have watched it she immediately begins butt bouncing in excitement. The tunes are catchy (I LOVE CEREAL Girl!) and Its a throw back to classic sesame street for me."
2932,738920061,5,As they say in espanol  ESTUPENDO.  Great songs fabulous presentation and it works. Couldn't rate it highly enough. Lo Mejor  The other titles I have purchased were also of a high standard and most enjoyable.
2933,738920061,3,"There's some parts of the video that is really entertaining, but also had a lot of filler stuff that didn't really get my daughter's attention.  For the most part, I'd say this one is OK."
2934,738920061,5,"As a mom, this is one of my favorite Sesame Street videos and my two-year-old also loves it. Grover is my favorite character and I bought the video because Grover is featured on the cover. I love Grover's interactions with the ""blue man"" ...they are so funny. Along with Grover and the ""blue man"", there are great songs and videos of children eating and playing. Some of our favorites are... ""blueberry mouths"" and ""cereal girl"" . Excellent video!!"
2935,738920061,3,"Remeber Grover the Waiter and his chubby blue customer?  This video is a great chance to visit them again - Grover has ""worked his way up in the food business"" to become a Planet Storybook (read Hollywood) waiter and change the unhealthy eating habits of his favorite customer.  Along the way are lots of gags about storybook characters (Grover trips over Jack Be Nimble's candlestick, for instance - and the restaurant is decorated with memorobilia like Cinderella's glass slipper)  Very cute.
I think I'm not cool enough to enjoy the song clips, but if you and your kids enjoy spoofs, you'll like them: ""Cereal Girl,""  Cookie monster rapping about ""Healthy Food,"" and bologna, cheese, and bread singing ""Telly's Lunch"" (Brady Bunch Theme) I liked ""Blueberry Mouth,"" a Leon Redbone style (?) tune about blueberry picking.
I don't know that it made any difference in eating behavior with my son, but he's a pretty good eater anyway.  He enjoyed it, though: particularly the singing broccholi."
2936,738920762,5,"I originally started with the Baby Bach and Mozart tapes for my baby boy, who is now 11 months (at about 4 months)but I could see he was getting bored with the Baby Einstein set.  I noticed he liked Sesame Street, so I purchased the ""123 Count with Me"", video - Well he is addicted!  He laughs along with Ernie and friends.  He also get's a real big kick out of the bellhop-rat!  It was by no choice of our own that my husband and I now know all the songs and can occasionally be found singing them at work and in other embarrassing public places.  I really think a child couldn't help to memorize 1-20 just by knowing the opening and closing songs.  I would just like to WARN you... no more ""News at 6"" or ""HBO"" once this video becomes a favorite!"
2937,738920762,5,"When Ernie drops by ""The Furry Arms"" hotel to return a missing key he found, he ends up giving everyone a lesson in counting, and also ends up getting hired as hotel manager! Ernie soon discovers that when he ""Dings The Dinger"", Benny The Bunny (Kevin Clash-who also does Elmo) will bring him something different everytime, depending on the number of times he dings. For example, when Ernie dings 3 times, Benny brings 3 pillows. Ernie however, does not need the pillows, and tells Benny he's glad he now knows what happens when he dings 3 times. This running gag goes during the entire video, and it gets quite funny. Most of the segments in this video are well chosen, such as a neat segment with singing crows, and the fantastic ""Honk Around The Clock""! I also find the new songs very catchy, and have found myself sing them quite often! This not only gets five stars becalse it's much better then ""The Great Numbers Game"", but also becalse it's extremely funny! In recent years, The Furry Arms seems to have been deleted from the show. Why? It was such a great place, and I liked Natasha's parents having a job! Oh, well. At least we have this video!"
2938,738920762,4,"Like many parents, I purchased this with the belief that it would be far better than other programs, and also serve as a good educational vehicle -  and we were not disappointed.  Our daughter adores the characters, and her  comprehension for counting continues to grow.  The difference between  Barney stuff (entertainment) vs. Sesame street (edu-tainment) is amazing.
As an adult, I find myself humming along to the tunes.  Okay, so I  happen to be a big kid.  In any case, your kids will enjoy it, and as a  parent, you will have a guilt free conscience about your kids consuming too  much TV."
2939,738920762,3,"I bought this video at the same time as I bought ""Do the Alphabet"" and now my two-year old nephew won't watch it.  He only asks for ""Bic Birt"" (Big Bird is on the box of ""Alphabet"").  I've tried sneaking it into the VCR when he isn't watching in hopes he'll  get hooked, but he always asks plaintively for the other one.  Personally,  I think that they count a little fast for him while the  ""Alphabet"" tape goes pretty slow.  And Baby Bear is always a  winner.  I think though that he will appreciate when he gets a little  older."
2940,738920762,4,"I have 3 pre school children, the oldest 5 years old reads, and counts thanks to Sesame street, program and videos"
2941,738920762,4,"My 18 month old has been enjoying this video for months.  It has some old favorites (""#9 cutie"", ""One singular sensation"") and some new catchy tunes (""1 and 2 and 3"" sung by three counting  crows, ""Seven"" sung by Dorothy andher goldfish friends &  ""Five"" rapped by M.C. Elmo)as well.  They count all the way up to  15 and there is almost a song for every number."
2942,738920762,5,"My 21 month old son has watched this video countless times. It is hands down one of his favorites. This tape spotlights Ernie (one of his favorite Sesame Street characters) and includes Elmo in several segments - always a  plus.  The best part is he's already learned to count to ten. And although  he's watched this many times , I'm not at all sick of it.  The songs are  fun and catchy and in typical Sesame Street fashion, the muppets are clever  and entertaining, even for adults.  I highly recommend this video."
2943,738920762,4,This is my 18-month old son Max's favorite video. He dances to the songs  that are a mix of classic skits (that I remember from when I watched Sesame  Street) and modern pop rock spoofs. It's a video that both parents and  children will love.  END
2944,738920762,5,"Bought this for my 2 year old son.  He loves the songs and is learning to count along. From the parent's perspective, it's catchy but not terribly annoying, even when on the inevitable toddler repeat loop."
2945,738920762,5,A+ luring video
2946,738920762,5,Great video for learning. Can't wait for my grandson to learn from it.
2947,738920762,5,"My toddler son loves Sesame Street. His favorites are Elmo and Ernie. He loves this DVD. It's educational, fun, and colorful."
2948,738920762,5,Sons favorite
2949,738920762,4,My 2 1/2 and 1 yr old love this dvd. Its super cute with catchy songs that teach them to count.
2950,738920762,5,Good
2951,738920762,1,I am sure it would have been great but unfortunately it does not work in my region. I wish I knew that before I bought it as now it is too expensive to return to get my refund.
2952,738920762,1,it didn't work i am so upset !! although i bought shapes DVD with it and it is worked properly.
2953,738920762,5,2 year Toddler loves
2954,738920762,5,:)
2955,738920762,3,ok
2956,738920762,5,Great for learning!  Keeps granddaughter's attention.
2957,738920762,5,my grandkids love it and so does their parents!
2958,738920762,5,I think I like it more than my kids..
2959,738920762,5,My 1 year old loves this dvd
2960,738920762,3,It starts off slow for a one year old child.  It is not a bad DVD but it may be more for an older child with a  longer attention span.  I attempt to watch the entire dvd but my son was so bored with it I had to turn it off and turn his attention to something more entertaining.
2961,738920762,5,cost very little but a big and good investment for the kid.
2962,738920762,5,Kids love it
2963,738920762,5,Can never go wrong with Sesame Street learning.
2964,738920762,5,It's Sesame Street it's counting and the kids love it.
2965,738920762,5,Very entertaining and what a wonderful and fun way to learn counting. Five year old loves Sesame Street and especially this dvd. A+++
2966,738920762,4,"This dvd was a hit with the kiddos.  Doesn't seem as geared towards learning numbers as much as the abc dvd, but the kids like it so...."
2967,738920762,1,Video quality is not good !!
2968,738920762,5,My daughter and I love this DVD. We would play it over and over again! Counting is always fun!
2969,738920762,5,My preschooler who was struggling to count past 10 is now counting to 20 with ease and only after watching for a week!
2970,738920762,5,I recommend it
2971,738920762,5,good counting activity
2972,738920762,5,I love this for my great grand children. They are learning from the dvds
2973,738920762,4,great book for a toddler to learn numbers
2974,738920762,5,Grandson loves it
2975,738920762,3,uh
2976,738920762,5,grandson loves it!
2977,738920762,5,nice
2978,738920762,4,Suitable for pre-schoolers. Educating and witty.
2979,738920762,5,"I love it. My daughter not so much. She loves yo gabba gabba. I watch it, she watches yo gabba; so we both win:)"
2980,738920762,1,Received with a cracked cd.
2981,738920762,5,good
2982,738920762,5,"packaged as advertised, great product"
2983,738920762,5,Great
2984,738920762,5,Thank you
2985,738920762,5,Who does not like ernie. my nieces like the songs. Reminds me of my childhood
2986,738920762,5,My grandson loves it!!!!
2987,738920762,5,Again a great gift for a 4 year old.
2988,738920762,5,i bought this for my cousin and they seem to love it. the only appropriate review would be all 5 stars
2989,738920762,5,very good indeed.
2990,738920762,5,My 20 month old loves this film!!! He watches it and even tries to count with them. He knows the names of the characters too. It is a very colorful newer production as opposed to some of the films that have a bright cover but are really films from the early 90s. It does have a few throwback scenes in it which are all good. I would recommend this movie!!!
2991,738920762,5,My daughter loves this video so much.  We started playing it for her in the car when she was around 1 years old.  She sings along and never gets tired of it.  I even bought it for others as gifts.
2992,738920762,4,According to my daughter the grandkids really enjoy this.  Morgan a bit more she is 3.  Carter is just going on 2 in June.
2993,738920762,5,"My daughter likes this video... It isn't her favorite (she prefers Grover), but she enjoys watching it - Other posters complained about the bunny being rude - he IS short tempered, but it's more humorous than offensive (in my opinion)..."
2994,738920762,5,Awesome movie and condition of dvd. I will buy another copy as the condition was good and my grand daughter loves it.
2995,738920762,5,"My 2 year old loves loves loves this DVD. Great for learning how to count!
Cute/repetitive songs that are perfect for learning!"
2996,738920762,5,My grandson loves it and talks along with the characters.  A good way to learn and making it fun for his age.
2997,738920762,5,"I highly recommend this video - Ernie and his cute little friends make learning how to count lots of fun!  Our toddler sings the 1-2-3 song all the time - in fact, this video is how she learned to count beyond the number ten!  Highly recommend."
2998,738920762,5,Great video for my 18 month grandson who loves Elmo. He is starting to count now even tho we are not pushing it
2999,738920762,5,My children enjoyed this video very much.  The video is very entertaining and educational.  The lenght of the video is perfect.
3000,738920762,5,"I got this for my daughter to watch as an educational show rather than letting her watch what I consider more ""junk"" shows.  I don't like her watching too much TV but Grandma will let her watch plenty so it's easier to buy things like this and 'redirect' what she let's my daughter watch.  This is very engaging and educational.  My daughter loves all the sesame street characters."
3001,738920762,5,"daughter loved it when she was 2-3 yrs old, Its a childs DVD not sure what else to say its cute?  Helps them learn?"
3002,738920762,5,Now my grandson counts all the time with no effort.  This is a good educational too for Toddlers to havefor their learning.
3003,738920762,5,I bought for movies for them to watch in the car. They chose this one every time. My 20 month old daughter is counting now.
3004,738920762,3,"I love Sesame Street and I like the other DVDs I have purchased so far. This one is not great.

One if the characters is angry and annoyed and in a bad mood through most of the program. His voice gets on my nerves. I don't enjoy listening to it while I am driving and I don't really want my daughter to be influenced by seeing the character's negative behavior.

We rarely play this one."
3005,738920762,2,"I gave this to a friend's daughter who is 27 months old. She's just beginning to watch video as her parents waited until she was two years old before exposing her to videos. She was eager to watch the video, but after five or ten minutes she said, ""I don't like this."" She asked for Elmo. Her mother tried to fast forward to other places in the video, but she soundly rejected it. Instead, she happily watched the Letter factory video I sent her a few weeks ago.

We're still hoping with time and more exposure she might come to like this video. But today I ordered her the Elmo Potty Training video. If she wants Elmo; I'll send her Elmo.

October 2, 2013

Her mother says she doesn't like this video because of the grouchy rabbit who is a main character."
3006,738920762,4,"overall this is a very good entertainment for both me and my 20 month old kid. the rabbit Benny was rude, Ernie was annoying by bothering the rabbit which he was told not to. It's not really a good example for the kids, but it was funny. It has some fun music and we enjoyed that. It might not help a lot if I want to teach my 20 month old counting numbers with this video."
3007,738920762,5,"I once had these dvds on vhs tapes years ago for my son.  He is now 15 years old, and I was excited to know that my daughter would have an opportunity to enjoy them as well.  Thank you for having these tapes available."
3008,738920762,5,"I use this Cd for my daycare. When I'm busy cooking or cleaning, I can count on this music to keep my littles busy"
3009,738920762,2,"My 2 year old daughter enjoys the songs, but the snarky and rude behavior modeled by Ernie and the bellhop is a bad example for her. Sesame Street, at its best, teaches children respect and kindness towards others. That's not only absent here, but what is shown is the opposite of how I would like my child to behave."
3010,738920762,5,"I have a 16 month grandchild that I travel with and keeping her attention is hard. But this has full color, singing and counting. She already counts to 5 but now she at the number 8! Total babysitter"
3011,738920762,5,"I LOVE this dvd! I love meeting Elmo's alter ego Benny.
He's the best!!!!
A tired,rattled, rabbid bunny who spends his time trying to run the fuzzy arms, while the place is in true Ernie form going nuts.
I use this dvd in my classroom, and I Never get sick of it.{And in this particular class it is new every time we watch it. It's great for the last half hour on a Friday.}
LOVE THE BUNNY!!!!!!!!!!!"
3012,738920762,2,thought i would use it for my grandson.have to wait till he is older.not as musical or colorfull as i had hoped
3013,738920762,5,My 1 year old son loves this video all the singing and shenanigans with counting he dances and claps his hands. Catchy and fun songs
3014,738920762,5,"Super, super fast shipping. My 4 year old nephew is developmentally delayed and this video has really helped his math skills. Also bought him a rubber duckie (99 cents at Walmart) to go with it!"
3015,738920762,5,"This dvd came sooner than expected and is entertaining. My son loves it.  I recommend anyone looking for a fun, educational movie to check this out."
3016,738920762,5,"These DVD are just as pleasurable for the parents as for the tots! My little guy loves this video. The songs are catchy, the Muppets/puppets have great characters - yes even the surly rat bellhop.

Above and beyond the obvious counting lessons to be learned here, there are many many great tactics taught to little ones. They learn how to make work easier by using skills available, how to deal with not so nice people and how to do research!

One thing I didn't know was that Sesame Street is completely non-profit. All proceeds go to help children around the world enjoy the wonderful and proven learning techniques these programs has to offer.

So, now I can buy a DVD that my son loves and get the pleasure of knowing I'm doing good for someone else."
3017,738920762,5,I bought this for our 2 year old who is learning to count.  He loves it!  It really adds to our Sesame Street collection.
3018,738920762,1,This tape doesn't play properly  It skips a lot.  My son got excited at the beginning and then it just started skipping.
3019,738920762,5,"I was at walmart a few months ago and I found this dvd in the $5 bin. Up until then my son had been watching your baby can read. His vocabulary improved from your baby can read however they didn't include a segment on numbers in the first 3 dvd's. I picked this up hoping it would help us introduce him to numbers. I must say I didn't expect him to like it as much as he does. He was only about 15 or 16 months at the time, but he started asking to watch the movie everyday. So, we made it a routine every morning he watches it after breakfast and sometimes before bed. By 18 or 19 months my son was recognizing numbers and pointing them out whenever he saw them. My son is now 22months and he can count to 10 with no problem. I also let my god-daughter watch it, and after a few times she was counting and singing the songs as well. Her parents were desperate for a copy of their own, but couldn't find it at walmart. Amazon has it so I'm going to order a copy for her. I recommend this to any parent who wants to help their child learn their numbers. It really is a great tool and the songs are so catchy that you'll be singing along with your child."
3020,738920762,1,"It's goofy enough for my son to think it's hilarious, but there is not much educational value to this dvd.  The clips are too random and jumpy- sometimes you are talking about a certain number for 5 seconds and sometimes you will spend 60 seconds on a certain number.  If you are wanting a dvd to help your child learn how to count, buy something else.

Thankfully I got this at a garage sale for $1 - but it wasn't even worth that.  Oh well."
3021,738920762,5,Bought this for my daughter to go with the flash cards/book and she loves it. If you have a child that loves Seasame Street this is for you. It is educational and keeps my 18 month old daughter interested. You can't go wrong with seasame street. This is a win in my books.
3022,738920762,5,"This movie is that perfect combination of educational, fun, and a real story. My kids love it, and it's enjoyable enough that I can sit through it as well, and even find myself humming the songs. This is one of the best Sesame Street products out there. I get such a kick out of the characters. . ."
3023,738920762,3,"Really Sesame Street?  Worst Sesame street DVD we've ever watched.  Bummed that I bought this.  ""Count on Sports"" is a much better counting DVD.  Basically, every other SS DVD we own is beyond WAY better than this one."
3024,738920762,4,Right now this DVD is not so exciting for my 1 and 2 year old but I liked it so I think in a few months my kids will love it.
3025,738920762,1,"I couldn't stand to listen to it, so my 2yr old hasn't watched it very often. But there is this weasel character (a bellhop) who gets paged every time they ding the bell. He comes into each scene yelling and complaining and ""talking ugly"" as we call it. This character alone was enough to turn me off the show. I much prefer the leapfrog series, whose characters have upbeat attitudes just right for toddler movies. I also hate the show Angelina Ballerina, so if you like that show you may not mind the weasel's grouchy angry words. Neither has characters I want my children to mimic!"
3026,738920762,5,My 4 year old loves this DVD.It teaches the basics of numbers in a really fun and creative way that grabs the toddler's attention. My little girl is definately hooked on it. She watches it every day :0)
3027,738920762,1,I bought this product with great hope. But it is not working in my kids portable DVD player. But I didn't get time to return it.
3028,738920762,5,I bought this video for my 2 year-old son to help him learn his numbers. He absolutely loves singing the numbers and can count to 20 on his own. This is probably great for kids who love Muppets and love to sing.
3029,738920762,5,This is an excellent product. It is both very educational and entertaining. My two year old loves it and is actually learning to count quickly. Highly recommended
3030,738920762,2,"My 2.5 yr old will watch just about anything, but this just has never grabbed her attention. I don't know if it's an Ernie issue and just not enough other characters or what, but she's just not having it. She usually loves Seasame Street stuff, but this is a big miss with her. I'm glad I bought used."
3031,738920762,5,"My daughter was 22 months old when we purchased this DVD and we alternated playing it daily for her, after naptime, with the Do the Alphabet DVD. Within 2-3 weeks she could count to 15 and one day surprised me by counting backwards using a number book we had. She is now 26 months old and is ready to count to 30 which we are working on. We incorporate counting and saying our alphabet letters throughout the day daily. Yesterday I parked in spot #21 which was very clearly labeled and she keeped saying ""12, 12, 12..."" I realized that we needed to advance her to learning more numbers b/c to her it looked like a 12 since she could only count to 15. There are some things you purchase that do not work with your child, and this one was like striking gold- it is the best purchase I've made, right up there with her BabyBjorn soft bib."
3032,738920762,5,"My little boy knew his alphabet before he was 18 months old and isn't two yet and is starting to spell.  He's not smarter than the other kids - with parents that constantly ask what we did to teach him the alphabet - he was just exposed to letters early.  This video was a huge help and he loves to sing with the songs.  Sesame Street Know what they are doing and this collection of the best letter skits is excellent.
We go somewhere almost every day and videos like this one get to play for 10 - 20 minutes and he learns on every car ride.  Mix videos like this with books and you'll be surprised at the results.
I said alphabet because we used the other Sesame Street videos to learn letters.  We got the same results for numbers with this video.  He now counts to 100 and he just turned four.  He also does basic math."
3033,738920762,5,"I bought this for my daughter a month ago.  She is now 10 months.  She loves puppets so I though this would be a good fit.  She watches this video intently and loves it.  I find it entertaining.  I've seen it at least 2 dozen times.  I like Benny, the surly, angry rabbit who is the bellhop.  He keeps it entertaining for adults with his sarcastic quips.  Highly recommended if your kids like puppets.  It will keep them entertained while learning about numbers."
3034,738920762,3,"This is a cute video with some catchy tunes (""one, two three, count with me, we'll count everything around us that we do and hear and see!""). It's not old enough to appeal to parents like me who like Sesame Street nostalgia and want to introduce their kids to the genius of Jim Henson. (Ernie, in particular, is without his characteristic mischief.) But, it's not new enough to be instantly recognizable to the kids of today. I'll put this video on without complaint when my daughter asks for it (she does like it) but it's not one of the first ones I reach for. I like the Count's ""Count It Higher"" much better."
3035,738920762,5,i got this video several moths ago from a local store and my daughter (2 1/2) loves it!  it has helped her with her numbers and she even sings along with all the songs now.  it's really cute!  my 7 month old seems to enjoy it too :)
3036,738920762,5,it simi-ly kept my nephew entertained which is a very hard thing to do he doesnt like to just sit there and do nothing so i think its ok for little kids!
3037,738920762,4,This is a pretty entertaining video as far as the Sesame Videos go.  I don't mind watching this one with my son.  Good songs and enough action to keep him entertained.
3038,738920762,5,this is one of the best thing i have ever done in my life.my kids love it.
3039,738920762,5,"My 22 month old granddaughter love this video. She loves to it's jazzy music and even sings with Elmo, etc. She know the number 5 now and no doubt the rest of the numbers in no time. She gets a lot of repetition from us, too."
3040,738920762,5,"The dvd arrived last week,for my 8 month old granddaughter. I decided on this dvd after reading the 5 star reveiws. I'm happy with the choice. It's educational,fun and entertaining. My granddaughter stops to look and listen when she hears several songs,rock around the clock,elmo singing #5 song and the crows singing. I'm sure as she gets older this be one of her favorite dvds. I usually play it twice back to back because I enjoy her smiles when she reacts to the songs. I HIGH RECOMMEND THIS DVD. I'm going to purchase another one so she will have one at her home."
3041,738920762,5,"My 19 month old son loves this video! It is about 30 minutes long- just enough time to clean up the kitchen and get a few other things done around the house. All the favorite characters are there as well as a few new ones I did not know about including ""Benny the Bunny"" who is really funny..Elmo does a rap for the number 5 that thrills my son. Good quality both sound and sight."
3042,738920762,5,"We first borrowed this from a friend and I am now ordering a copy for ourselves. My 4-yr old son love it! This is the best tool yet to improve his number skills. It is fun yet simple, and he never gets bored watching it. Even my 6-yr old son enjoys it.

I highly recommend this DVD. It is worth every cent!"
3043,738920762,5,They should be using these old Sesame Street video's in public school. It is probably the fastest and easiest way to teach.
3044,738920762,5,My 1 year old can count to 14!  The songs are funny and the both my kids love to watch it.
3045,738920762,5,"This funny & entertaining video helps teach young kids to count.  Each number has a catchy little song; the whole family enjoys it.  My husband confessed to whistling these tunes while at work!  This DVD has helped all my kids learn to count.  Also, try Sesame Street's ""Learning About Letters"" for the alphabet."
3046,738920762,3,It is ok dvd. But the style is bit old. I think the numbers are flashing too fast. If children watch for long time I guess it would not be so good for their eyes.
3047,738920762,4,"Our two-and-a-half year old really got into this, but didn't like ""learning about numbers"" at all, except for one little sequence that show 2 girls playing with a dollhouse. the two dvds are actually quite different: this one features elmo and ernie and feels very much geared toward children while ""learning about numbers"" actually seems like they were trying to entertain children and adults at the same time by adopting a mock talk show format where big bird is supposed to be some kind of jay leno standup. plus there is a lot of ""The Count"" in that LAN, and our toddler didn't like him at all!  Much better choice, I think, for toddlers. Only weakness is that they give short shrift or even skip over certain numbers between 1-20. Some kind of brainless editing decision by somebody who didn't get enought sleep, no doubt."
3048,738920762,5,"THIS IS MY FAVORITE KID'S VIDEO.  We originally borrowed this from the library.  We liked it so much, and I was so tired of having to return it after maxing out the renewals just to check it out again, that we decided to buy it.  The kids (2 and almost 4 years old) ask for it all the time.  I thought they'd be tired of it after a few months, but it still holds their interest.  The songs are a great compliation of really great Sesame Street production numbers.  We all sing along and, quite frankly, I can't get the songs for the numbers 3, 5, and 10 out of my head. The kids also like the bits with Ernie and Benny (don't call him bunny) between the songs which is usually when the kid's lose interest in this type of DVD."
3049,738920762,4,"You have to love Sesame Street-they consistently produce material that is child-friendly and educational.  The songs are catchy and it is a great tool for teaching numbers.  I did not give the video five stars because I think Benny is annoying, but that is just my opinion."
3050,738920762,5,"This DVD really helped my 2.5 year old daughter progress quickly with learning her numbers, and the different songs are great and catchy for singing in the car.  The only thing I don't understand is that in the opening number Ernie counts to 20, which is great, but as they go through each individual number they stop at 15?  That's still OK since most of the others only go to 10.  Overall a great educational DVD."
3051,738920762,3,"This one has some decent material, but it takes too long to get to it. It begins with Ernie finding a room key from the Furry Arms Hotel and he proceeds there to return it. Once there, he engages in some banter with Benny the Bunny, the hotel owner and some hotel staff. This goes on for several minutes and becomes tedious before some short Sesame Street segments are able to offer a brief respite. Some of these are good, though the song with three blackbirds is not very good and lasts too long. Also, the MC Elmo song about the Number Five is also on The Best of Elmo DVD; so, if you are looking for exclusive Elmo material for your child, this is not your best bet. Now, I like Ernie as much as the next person, but I'm not certain what they were thinking when they decided to feature so much interaction with other, practically unknown characters. He ends up dinging the bellhop bell fifteen times, which is way too repetitious for even the youngest viewer. Overall, this isn't terrible, but it is far from the best Sesame Street has to offer."
3052,738920762,5,"my 4 yr old absolutely loves it and even though i am not fond of television, i don't mind 30 minutes of silly educational songs."
3053,738920762,5,This is a very cute dvd and quite easy for me to watch with my 3 year old son.  This has a funny theme and is filled with great little songs about numbers.  Highly recommended!
3054,738920762,5,"My 22 month old daughter loves this dvd! It was a reward for using the potty multiple times.  She absolutely loves it and loves to count going up stairs, counts her toys in her crib, counts in the car! Great investment!"
3055,738920762,2,"I loved Sesame street growing up, but Sesame street as a whole seems to be going downhill to me.  This video, while it does have a couple of great vintage clips, models HORRIBLY rude and disobedient behavior.  The bunny is extremly rude to Ernie and the Honker, and Ernie and the Honker repeatedly bother and annoy Benny, even after Benny asks them to stop (and of course, asks in a rude way).  The educational value is minimal.  I really don't think this helped my child to count to 15 or to recognize his numbers.  If you want some good vintage Sesame STreet clips, check out the 25th anniversary.  Good clips, educational value is about the same, but no rude behavior, and no disobedient behavior."
3056,738920762,4,"it's just got heart and soul.  do you want to watch a slideshow of electronic toys with Mozart soullessly sequenced on synthesized marimbas, or do you want to watch real characters singing genuinely clever lyrics teaching the same stuff."
3057,738920762,1,"This DVD is just plain terrible. There is so much shouting and rude behaviour. In the video, Ernie continues to annoy the bunny even after the bunny has asked him to stop. This video will teach your children to be cheeky and annoying. Avoid it."
3058,738920762,5,"My 18-month old twin boys LOVE Ernie.  We found this DVD at our local library.  Well, this is one video you can enjoy listening to.  I also choose the 'Songs' option which is much easier for younger toddlers to follow. (Therefore, it's on the top of my purchase list)

Thumbs up!"
3059,738920762,5,"If you or your kids like Sesame Street, than this DVD is a must!
It's fun, creative, entertaining, and keeps your kids moving, dancing and counting!

We LOVE it!"
3060,738920762,4,Its pretty good. It took a while for my son to watch more than 5mins but now i just go to the songs and he watches the dvd. It has really helped with his counting. He just turned 2 on feb. 24th 2007. I would advise buying it if your kid is around his age for the counting part.
3061,738920762,4,"Purchased this for my Grandson who is 4 months old.  He has watched it three times and is very fascinated with it even though the theme is too advanced for him.  However, it will become a great learning tool in the near future.  Sesame Street is the greatest."
3062,738920762,3,This DVD was very advanced for my 18-month old. In Kids favorite Songs there is a lot of counting backwards from 10 to 1 which my kid loves too mimick (he still doesn't say much that can be understood) so I thought he would love this DVD. There is too much talking in the intro and it bores my kid as soon as it starts plus there is no Elmo. My kid loves Elmo and expects to see Elmo on Sesame Street. We are keeping this DVD for later when he is about 3 he might appreciate it then. Right now he has no interest in it whatsoever.
3063,738920762,4,"It has a storyline that incorporates lots of little clips from Sesame Street during my childhood, along with newer ones exposing my child to numbers in a musical way."
3064,738920762,5,The songs are great and really do help kids with numbers. Seasame Street does a great job of entertaining parents while teaching kids. Would recomment this DVD to any parent with kids who like music and songs and want to get better with numbers 1-20.
3065,738920762,4,"If you have kids, definitely this is the right choice for their TV time. Educative, fun, and long enough for their needs."
3066,738920762,5,My daughter is watching this video now - she LOVES IT! I do too - the songs are fun and make learning to count easy.
3067,738920762,5,My 2yr old daughter loves this.  Its got great songs and she loves to move and dance when its on.
3068,738920762,5,My daughter just loves Sesame Street.  She likes Ernie and the characters in the DVD.  Before she turned two she was able to count to 20 (not in order when she reached 15 but she got there when she reached 2)!! Great product!
3069,738920762,5,Excellent and great education for my daughter.entertaining as well. i'd like some more of this!!
3070,738920762,5,"It is excellent, and teaches our daughter numbers in a fun way.  She can watches this dvd over and over even we as parents enjoy it too."
3071,738920762,4,"The video is set around Ernie(one of the few human muppets in Sesame Street)

who introduces the world of numbers & counting to the operators of the Furry Arms Hotel.

My 19 month old loves it. The music is catchy. The characters are lovable(especially Benny the rabbit, the cantankerous Furry Arms bellhop).

However, for adults watching along it is a bit tiresome to see the numbers

repeated ad infinitum.

This con aside, worth buying for your toddler."
3072,738920762,5,This is a great video to get your child to learn numbers 1-20.  There are catchy songs and visual effects.
3073,738920762,5,and my daughter loves it too! This one is laugh-out-loud funny and the music is great!
3074,738920762,5,123 Count With Me really helped familiarize my then 2-3 year old daughter with not just the recognition of numbers and the concept of 'how many' but also the concepts of 'sequence' and why we 'count' things. Excellent production with a light sprinkling of humor moms and dads can appreciate while sitting on the couch with the little one. My favorite? The 'Counting Crows'!  Check it out!
3075,738920762,5,"We have watched this DVD, oh, about 40 times since I got it 2 weeks ago.  My 2yo twins start saying ""Bo Ernie, Bo Ernie"" as soon as we get in the car (the place where they get to watch tv). I know if the boys could vote they would give it 5 stars hands down!"
3076,738920762,5,"I wish CTV would consider reissuing ""Sesame Street"" as a chronological series, starting with ""Season One,"" and working their way to the present... I would love to see the old episodes as they were originally broadcast, not with a few select bits chopped up into the new, modern mix. The old shows were so wonderful... plus that awful, whiny Elmo was nowhere to be seen! Anyway, that's my wish as a Sesame Street kid who now has a kid of my own... PS - yay, Ernie!"
3077,738920762,2,"I rarely review books or DVDs but I felt compelled to do so with this one because it is really, really bad.  There's a lot of yelling from one of the main characters (the bunny) and, though the songs are cute, there's no way to play all of the songs without also watching some of the bunny, who comes across as really cantankerous and angry.  I love Sesame Street as a general rule, but strongly dislike this particular video."
3078,738920762,5,"This video is fantastic. My kids are 1 and 2, and both absolutely love it. It's easy to understand what Ernie and the rest of the characters are saying (which is what I find annoying about Elmo and Zoe), and the songs are great (with inclusion of one or two songs from the 70's that I know and love!)."
3079,738920762,4,"This DVD is good as far as exposing children to numbers and my 2 year old seemed to enjoy it, but the bunny is VERY rude. My son has not asked to watch it so I haven't shown it to him since the first viewing, because if the rudeness of the bunny. I would prefer if they made an effort to display or encourage good manners as well as  teach about academic things, like Barney tends to do."
3080,738920762,4,"The Sesame Street - 123 Count with Me pulls together a neat theme that holds the attention of my grandchildren.  Its hard to compete with all the wild cartoons going on that bombard children today, but my 3 and 2 year old grandchildren are mesmerized by it and they've watched it twice so far.  I felt like it was worth buying.  I'm glad I have it."
3081,738920762,3,I've been disappointed with this video.  The bunny is a bit over the top for me and I don't think this video's story line flows as well.  I'm sure their are MUCH better counting videos out there...
3082,738920762,5,"This is the first Sesame Street video we've purchased for our two-year-old.  We've been extremely happy with it for a number of reasons:

* The song segments, many of which are based on adult songs ranging from ""One"" (A Chorus Line) to ""Rock Around the Clock,"" are well-produced and very funny.

* There's a plot, but it's mainly a device to tie the song segments together and to throw in as many sight gags as possible along the way.  Perfect for the attention span of a very young child.

* Plenty of yuks for the adults in true Sesame Street style.  The hotel owner is Ms. Sherry Netherland...the Furry Arms has a half-star restaurant featuring Peanut Butter Goulash as the daily special...if you watch carefully, there are a few subplots involving only characters that appear in the background.  Sesame Street assumes that people of all ages will be watching; it's a rare producer for young viewers that does this.

Our daughter has watched this video for only a few weeks and already counts aloud more easily than she did before ""Count with Me.""  It's the only video we own that we'll gladly sit down and watch with her.  Thumbs up!"
3083,738920762,5,"I have nothing but praise for the 1, 2, 3 Count With Me video (hosted by Ernie, not Elmo). For the sake of comparison, I do not hold Sesame Street's Do the Alphabet video (hosted by Big Bird) in high regard. In 1, 2, 3 Count With Me the story cleverly centers around work at the Furry Arms Hotel and with great comic relief shows children practical applications for using numbers. I bought the video when my son was two years old. My children, currently ages 4 1/2 and 2, learned number recognition and numeric order reliably thanks to the catchy theme song and clips highlighting specific numbers. Now that my oldest child is successfully learning addition, I see in a new light the importance of reinforcing numerical order (adults take it for granted). Educational value aside, this video makes them laugh out loud too."
3084,738920762,1,"The screaming bunny is just terrible. He's not funny, and he introduced my daughter to downright meanness. I'd sell this dvd, but I don't want it to affect any other kids!"
3085,738920762,5,This is a great DVD - my daughter is 19 months and enjoys to watch it.  It is classic Sesame Street - catchy songs and great characters.
3086,738920762,5,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old. While I was watching it with her, I noticed segments from when I was her age watching sesame street on tv. She loves this dvd."
3087,738920762,4,"This works well as a teaching aid if you are wanting to teach your child/children how to count. I like the fact that my daughter learns a lot quicker and easier instead of just having me sit there and go over the numbers and it can get boring. It provides some songs and dances here and there and my kid seems to enjoy watching it. I recommend this to families that are looking to teach their kids, and just want a little extra to help them along."
3088,738920762,4,Great show...but the bellhop is quite abrasive and annoying. My son loves the counting songs.
3089,738920762,4,"Educational DVDs should be cheaper (at least USD 6.00) & it'll help all education-concious parents to buy them. Besides, their DVD running time is approximately 40 minutes. My 12-month-old niece is into cartoon in the first place. My sister-in-law's mistake. Cartoon offers her entertainment. And my wife told her younger sister that Sesame Street DVD can be a good tool for babies/kids to learn & promised her it'll be a birthday gift for her daughter. Sadly, we can't find any Sesame Street DVD in Malaysia & if there is any, the price will be around RM 80 (USD 20.00). That's when I logged on to Amazon.com & purchased it. Now she has gradually developed big interest in watching the DVD. The only dissatisfaction I have is that the captioning doesn't appear (only the subtitle appears). The captioning is good for impaired-hearing people & kids to learn about reference to situation (eg. ""chattering"", ""laughing""). I've bought few DVDs from Amazon before (eg. American Me) & the captioning appears as just fine on my region-all DVD player. Regards, Irwan Shah from Malaysia."
3090,738920762,3,"my 2 year old won't watch this video. i bought it about 6 months ago, and she watched it maybe a half a dozen times then, but if i suggest it now I get an emphatic NO. she loves counting books and activities, so my guess is the Furry Arms, the monster couple that run it, and benny the bunny just don't resonate with her, because she typically loves ernie. I wish i'd gotten the count's counting DVD instead."
3091,738920762,5,"My daughter, now 15 months absolutely loves this DVD and has since she was about 4 months old.  At first it was mostly the music she liked, but now she really watches the DVD and enjoys the characters (even Benny.)  There are tons of songs, and she loves to dance.  Also, if your kiddo doesn't like sitting through the entire DVD, you can just watch the songs and sing together without going through the whole bit.  I would absolutely recommend this one."
3092,738920762,5,"My son loves this DVD. He is 11 months old and can't get enough of this program.  Even my 2 year old nephew can't get enough of it.  It's all Ernie so if you child doesn't care for Ernie, they may not sit and watch it.  It such a cute program with Benny the Bunny.  What a jokester! I think any kid would love it but again, it's all Ernie."
3093,738920762,5,This one is funny and entertaining.  Very cute and educational at the same time.  You'll find yourself singing along!
3094,738920762,3,"My daughter is 19 months old and loves Sesame Street. But we were disappointed that she didn't like this DVD. She found the rabbit/bellhop character annoying and a little scary. He's kind of ugly and mean, and unfortunately he's the main character after Ernie. And her favorite character, Elmo, is only in one vignette. It was also too slow to hold her attention without more of her favorites like Elmo or Cookie Monster in it. She's learning to count just great without it anyway, so we'll probably just give it to someone else."
3095,738920762,5,"My 2 year old daughter loves Ernie, and hence she loves this DVD. However, I think I love it more. After watching many children's tapes, DVDs, programs, etc, I think I have a well informed appreciation of puppetry and it comes no finer than in this story. The subtle (or not so subtle at times) body language of Benny the Bunny is remarkable and he truly steals the show. Ernie is also excellent and the whole story flows along at an interesting pace. Look out for the penguins! My wife and I now have a running joke every time we order fish in a restaurant!!"
3096,738920762,4,"We rented this from Netflix first and it's a current favorite.  Both my 2 year old and my 3.5 year old like it and the 3 year old has learned to count from it, to 10 easily and is working on up to 20 pretty well so far.  I like several of the songs (and as a musician I'm picky) and the Sesame Street characters are generally appealing (although I can live without Elmo doing Rap).  A bonus was that I remember the ""number nine martian cutie"" song from my youth! :-)"
3097,738920762,5,"My 8 month old daughter has been watching this video for over a month now, and she loves it!  The story is fun, and the songs are very catchy.  I find myself humming them at work sometimes.  I highly recomend this DVD."
3098,738920762,2,"The story line is very boring.  My toddler loses interest immediately.  As a parent, I do as well.  Compared to some of the other Sesame dvd's, this one is poor. Story line is portrayed by Ernie, along with ""second string"" characters.  I think you should spend your money on other learning materials."
3099,738920762,5,"My 5 month old loves it - and he doesn't even get how cute it is yet!  Still he loves the music and he laughs uncontrollably and many scenes.
I don't mind watching it, either.  The tunes are pretty catchy and I end up singing them at work (an unfortunate side effect)."
3100,738920762,5,"I have several Sesame Street videos but this is by far the most entertaining and engaging for my 10-month old daughter, as well as for me! The songs are catchy, and the storyline is very funny.  My little girl absolutely loves it!  If you only could chose one video to buy, I would definitely recommend this one."
3101,738920762,5,"I LOVE THIS DVD.  My daughter, Leah is 2 years old and after only 2 weeks of watching this video.  She learned to count to 10.  It is a must have for every child's dvd collection!!!"
3102,738920762,5,This is the best educational video in the sesame street collection for teaching numbers.  I'm even going to purchase it for my sister in -law who is having a baby.  It has catchy tunes and upbeat music to go along with counting so little ones can't help but want to try to count along...thus teaching them to count!
3103,738920762,3,"This dvd does not keep my son's attention as well as other dvds out there (Baby Einstein, Richard Scary), but he does love the musical numbers & will dance with them. Obviously, the educational value is high, but I would have expected better from Sesame Street."
3104,738920762,4,"It is fun to watch and also educational to some extent. After watching this video several times, my 22 month old son learned how to count. It was surprisingly quick. But my son keeps following what benny does. He throws stuff to the floor, and yells loudly. I think benny is a nasty character."
3105,738920762,5,"My 18 month old daughter loves this dvd.  And you know what?  I do, too!  There are some classic songs I remember from Sesame Street as a child along with some newer songs, all about counting.  All the songs are catchy and fun.  My daughter is learning how to count with the help of Ernie, his friends, and Elmo, as well.  Sesame Street has once again succeeded at making learning an enjoyable experience!
The DVD is nice because the menu has all the songs available to listen to at your preference. The length is about 40 minutes. This is a great buy, and I highly recommend it!"
3106,738920762,5,"This video is so much fun.  My 15-month-old starts dancing as soon as it comes on.  The ""Counting Crows"" segment along with a little ""Bob Dylan"" make this just as entertaining for moms and dads. As usual, Sesame Workshop scores a winner!"
3107,738920762,3,"I have to say I had higher hopes for this video; Sesame Street has such a wonderful stable of number clips, and I was hoping to see better ones.
So, for the first time, I'm recommending the between-clip footage over the clips!  The opening song ""That's How The Numbers Go"" could easily become the numerical version of the ABC song; its jazzy and singable and goes all the way to twenty.  The setup is that Ernie stops by the Furry Arms Hotel to return a lost room key, where he shows bumbling hotel owners Humphrey and Ingrid that things (like room keys) can be organized with numbers.  I also like that this video isn't scrubbed clean of any conflict - the much-maligned bellhop, Benny the Bunny, is one of Kevin Clash's best characters, and he's terrific in this video; he and Ernie show how to return a sour face with a smile (and some innocent teasing!)
Although there is one good clip - ""Martian Beauty #9,"" unfortunately, this doesn't include some of the ingenious and artistic number clips from Sesame Street past:  no bakers falling down stairs, no pinball machine, no counting marble machines.  Instead, you get the lukewarm ""#11 rap,"" which shows pictures of 11 things, and ""Five Jive with Elmo Hammer,"" which is already on too many Sesame Street videos as it is.  Yawn."
3108,738920762,5,"I bought this for my seven month old on a whim as my wife and I were looking for some DVDs from the Baby Einstein video series.  But after watching this, we are glad we made this purchase. The characters are great and, in typical Sesame Street fashion, are goofy as heck!  Benny has to be our favorite character and I'm sorry one reviewer didn't take more kindly to him - he definetly brings more humor to this already funny video.  Think of him as a funnier Oscar.  The songs are extremely catchy - I find myself humming them on my way to work (shh, don't tell anyone!).  This has quickly become the most watched DVD in our home!
...and oh yeah, my kid really likes it too!"
3109,738920762,5,My son 2 years old really like it even me . the song is great. easy to listen and remember. my son tell me to play it again and again. you got to have this one.
3110,738920762,5,Lots and lots of Ernie!
3111,738920762,5,"My 2.5 year old want's this & the A to Z DVD all the time. We live in Israel, and he learned the english numbers within a week of seeing the DVD! (he only knew the hebrew count before)
A good buy"
3112,738920762,4,"We love this DVD.  My son enjoys and asks for it frequently.  Highly recommend...my son loves to count things now!
HOWEVER, I do have just one small complaint.  The ""chapters"" are not clean...if you go to the chapter on the number 3 you get the tail end of 2; chapter 5 closes with the beginning of the next number.  This is annoying...especially when you want to go to a number and you have to sit thru the end of the previous chapter and all the while La Petite Prince is chanting 3 3 3 3 3 3 3.
I have noticed that the SS DVD's (like Follow that Bird for example) don't have logical clean chapters....why?  It doesn't seem like rocket science to me..."
3113,738920762,4,"This is a nice video, gives a chance to learn the numbers, but the Sesame Street Learning About Letters cassette was much better. I'm not sure the plot is so easily understood and it would have been nice to have the numbers run through more frequently or more songs and less of standing around and talking. Nevertheless it is a very good cassette and is recommended over the age of 2."
3114,738920762,3,"Yep, despite that voice change, this is a truly engaging disc. Sesame Street is still as entertaining to me as an adult as it was when I was a kid, and my kid is now enjoying this too.
But I must take a minute and criticize the sound quality of this disc (and 'Do The Alphabet' as well). In normal operation, I will run my TV volume at 19, 26 for VHS, 23 for DVD. This DVD requires  the volume turned up to an unbelievable 37 before it's decently audible. But when I pop in the 'Kids Favorite Songs 1'  DVD, I have to turn the volume DOWN to 14. What is up with this, Sony Wonder?"
3115,738920762,4,"My 14-month old daughter has watched this several dozen times already, and she still picks this one out when given a choice between this or another Sesame Street video. She loves Ernie and Elmo, both of whom appear regularly in the show, and while she still isn't saying her numbers, I'm pretty sure she's getting the concepts figured out. I also make sure to interact with her to help reinforce the concepts and help keep her focused.
Even though I've watched it with her for at least half of those viewings, I generally enjoy watching it with her. Part of the reason is the different segments are well-done and actually have the occassional bit of adult humor (e.g., the ""counting crows"" who sing about 3 -- supposedly the source for the band's name), and also for the things that happen in the background as Ernie interacts with Benny and the Dinger (for instance, when Ernie dings the Dinger for the first time, watch the action in the background -- it's quite funny, and definitely targeted for the adults who are watching along!)."
3116,738920762,5,"Sure, it teaches them to be naughty and tease like Ernie teases poor lazy Benny, but it has a nice story line, and really teaches the numbers -- my son just starts dancing when he hears the title song sung by Ernie.  Lots of the songs are pretty good, and definitely stick in your head.  The great thing(imo) is that Elmo has only a small bit, and this video has firmly lodged Ernie as his absolute favorite Sesame Street Character!!!  He talks about tubby time and bath(not on this DVD though), and has learned some numbers (I think :-)) We have a laugh at Benny every time we watch, which is a few times a week -- would be 24 x 7 if it was my son's choice."
3117,738920762,5,"My 1.5 yr old loves this and she can actually count now!  Filled with songs and old standbys, you cant go too wrong with this one.  For maximum ""babysitting time"", try 25th anniversary DVD - it is an hour long!  this one is half that."
3118,738920762,5,"I have created a monster!!! My kid only watches two movies out of his 26 cartoon videos, so the rest are useless now. I have to play these movies all day along. The first is, Sesame Street - 123 Count With Me. He started babbling 123 at the age of 18!!! The second is, ""Sesame Street - Do the Alphabets"". Both of these videos are must own videos. Best of all, they are educational."
3119,738920762,5,I am a mother of a 10 month old. She started watching this when she was 8 months old and just simply loves it. I can put her infront of the TV turn it on and a lot of times she will sit and watch the whole DVD! As you know for a 10 month old that is  unusually! But she loves it that much! I have a Nephew that is 2 years old and he just loves it as well! I recommend any parent out there that wants a educational fun Video/DVD for there child ages 6 months- 6 years this one is GREAT!!!!
3120,738920762,5,"I have a 9-month daughter and this video is the only thing that can soothe her when she's cranky
Worth every penny"
3121,738920762,4,"My four-year old son just asked if he could watch this for the 3rd time in a row this evening. The little story line (Ernie is learning the routine in the Furry Arms, the local hotel) is entertaining for little kids-- as are the characters. Some are over-the-top, but with little kids, they *have* to be so the kids recognizee they're obnoxious.
For kids who avoid counting, this is a good way to sneak it in. They don't realize it's ""good for them""!"
3122,739040375,5,"I've worn out this video over the years cause I got it on VHS,now its on DVD! My few comments on Paul Gilbert is that through his playing,he show's alot of discipline and passion on the way he play's. but most of all, he's passionate about music thats why he got to the level of where he's at. I've meet him couple of times at a NAMM show and it was like talking to the next door neighbor. no rocks star attitude just plain Paul Gilbert DOWN TO EARTH...If your like me who's alway's practicing to get better all the time and to learn more, GET THIS DVD and apply the skills you learn from Paul in a band situation when its called for. I happen to be fortunate that growin up in the 80's doing this stuff called shred playing was the NORM back then, so I caught up to this GIT style real quick and for the most part,this was the ticket to be in a band back then.
if you've never done this kinda stuff then be prepared for some seriouse learning curve adjustments. Dont give up keep up on practicing and discipline,some things don't come easy but when you get there, its personaly an awesome accomplishment,convidence builder. but most of all one's you can master 2 or 3 of Paul's licks it comes easier cause it builds on top of each other. happy picking and have some good laughter on Paul's humor..."
3123,739040375,5,"This was produced going on 20 years ago, (the 1st half anyway) but is still relevant today.  After the post-grunge backlash of the early to mid 90's it is good to see this style of playing coming back.  Paul is an unassuming character whose delivery & instruction of his style & technique is very helpful & down to earth.  The 1st half of the DVD was done in his early Racer X days & really reflects the licks from that era, as the 2nd half naturally exposes the Mr. Big pop oriented offerings.  This DVD will either inspire you to attempt to reach his level of technique, or really discourage you.  But again, I believe his good nature will inspire most.  I was able to meet Mr. Gilbert at a clinic shortly after ""To be with you"" was a hit for Mr. Big years ago & he was still really down to Earth.  A whole new generation have the opportunity to learn from him & really should make this DVD part of their library.  Just do your best to ignore the 80's-90's ""production"" :)  Also the addition of the .PDF files for Vol. 2 is a nice touch!"
3124,739040375,4,"Paul Gilbert instructs viewers in his style of incredibly fast guitar playing while entertaining you with ""guitar tricks"" and Cheerleader segways.  A must buy for anyone who wants to learn speed picking techniques with a sense of humor."
3125,739040375,5,"Paul Gilbert got my attention in a tiny article from Guitar World, maybe Guitar Player, back in I'd say 87? maybe even earlier. he had just won a guitar gun slinger contest in the LA area and was heaed to GIT.  ayway, I kept an eye out for him along the way, and sho nuff, he is a technical monster. he may not send quite the emotional chills of say, I don't know, Eddie Van Halen (78-84 that is)? but the cat definitely sings some soul with his axe too, don't get me wrong.  I'd say, get his chops down, maybe some DiMeola master's level stuff too if you are into fast, clean, alternate picking as I try to be, then fuse your own soul with it--put some Clapton, SRV, Jimi, and Eddie in there--don't forget to bend it and shake it! you may come out with some really fresh, really good stylistic new frontiers--At least, that's what I'm after. just don't forget to make it YOUR OWN! balance in all things.  this video is all you need to get started on the Gilbert part of this equation.  its full, complete, and well done. His work with Mr Big is seriously good too, if a litte poppy, particularly their first two (I never got to hear too much of the later work.  enjoy, work the technque down to perfection, cleanly and slowly, then rip it up full speed when you're ready.  keep this vital part of intense rock alive and then, lift your goblets of rock!"
3126,739040375,5,"I just got this dvd a few weeks back and I can already feel a noticable improvement in my technique.  In the first section, he goes over picking, 3-note per string scales, chromatic and harmonic minor licks, hammer - ons and pull - offs and different arpeggio techniques, including sweep picking and string skipping.  In the second section, he gives more practical applications of the techniques and offers insight on how to improve phrasing and how to practice soloing.  Paul is a great teacher and he will keep you interested both with his playing and his sense of humor."
3127,739040375,5,"I own every Paul Gilbert video that I am aware of.  These two volumes have dramatically improved my technique, speed, phrasing, picking, etc.  Paul is an amazing teacher.  He explains everything in depth so that even the novice guitarist will understand most everything covered.  I own many other videos including Yngwie, Vinnie Moore, Richie Kotzen etc.  None of the other videos can compete with the Paul Gilbert videos. I often watch Intense rock 1 and 2 as refresher courses or just for plain entertainment.  If shred is your game, then look no further.  Learn from the best!"
3128,739040375,5,"This is the best purchase anyone can make if you want to shred being that finding a good teacher that can teach this skill is not easy. Paul besides being an incredible player covers all bases of Alternate Picking and String Skipping like he was in front of you. This is worth every singe penny. Now you have both instructionals on one DVD for the price of one!!!!

I own a vast array of instructionals, and if you only had 17 dollars to spend on a dvd, this is the best money you'll ever spent. Paul teaches shred like he was in front of you and believe me, no one posseses that skill. I also recommend his other instructionals after you are ready to move forward from this one Terryfying Guitar Trip, Get Out Of My Yard and his latest, Silence Followed By a Deafening Roar.

RATING 10"
3129,739040375,4,FUN LESSON
3130,739040375,5,"This dude is nuts, but he can play the guitar, and he teaches pretty good too.  Good DVD."
3131,739040375,5,intense guitar lessons.
3132,739040375,5,Thank you for my Paul Gilbert DVD. It is double plus premium and A-Okay! I now own Paul Gilbert guitarist on video. He is trapped forever!
3133,739040375,5,Best guitar instructional video that have seen in my 20 years of playing. Comes with video tabs which is great too!
3134,739040375,5,"Paul gilbert showing some of his favorite chops, a true innovator of the 80's
guitar era with racer x/mr.big and his solo work!!!!"
3135,739040375,5,"Muy bueno y explicativo para todo tipo de guitarristas, ayuda a incrementar la tcnica y rapidez.
Excelente DVD para tenerlo en consideracin en nuestra coleccin."
3136,739040375,5,Paul goes into great detail on scales arpeggios and everything you need to sound like a pro!!  I would highly recommend!!
3137,739040375,3,"I give this product three stars because it was good.  It is pretty basic.  There are good lessons here for fundamentals.  There are a couple of interesting arpeggio ideas, but really nothing to write home about.

Consists of picking exercises and simplistic scalar patterns.  Great for a player in their first few years."
3138,739040375,5,"If your leads only consist of Box 1 of the minor pentatonic scale, this DVD will leave you in the dust quickly. This is only for guitar hero-shredder types that have real chops. You need to be fluent in music theory, you must have absolute command of the entire fretboard, and you need to be fast in all the scale modes to keep up with the material. The video is very entertaining and packed with info that will help any guitarist no matter your skill set; the problem is, you won't be able to play the examples up to speed. Watching a virtuoso like Mr Gilbert run up and down the fretboard at the speed of light is worth the price of the DVD. An amazing guitarist!"
3139,739040375,5,"Nice lessons from the shredder King, is better start with this DVD, recommended for increase your guitar skills and fun"
3140,739040375,5,"... at a price that cannot be beat.  the product contains both of paul's first 2 dvd's and offers a huge selection of over-the-top shred guitar.  i had the 1st vhs way back in the day (the 80s!!!) and just about wore it out so i had to purchase this item just to have.  if you want to take your guitar playing to the next level and save some coin in the process, get this."
3141,739040375,5,"I am speaking for someone else here, but I am very very happy with my purchase nonetheless. I got the dvds for my boyfriend who is a professional guitarist and he was ecstatic! thank you amazon for having everything I can ever think of to get for someone."
3142,739040375,2,"Part 1 of this DVD is crammed with standard shred licks...but not much in the way of how, when and where to use them. In that respect, it's one of the more disorganized guitar instructional videos I've seen. Despite Paul's youth and enthusiasm,, the material gets relatively advanced rather quickly (and he can play the licks so fast and perfect, it's just as discouraging as inspirational).

In Part 2, he sporadically mentions things that would be aimed at relative beginners...which definitely doesn't belong on these videos.  On the other hand, Example #7 is so much more intricate/difficult than anything else on this disk, it seems out of place.  The best thing on the whole disk are the 2-note per string/string skipping arpeggios (wish I woulda started practicing those 10 years ago). There are a couple of other cool licks, but the video ends up a mess of a lot of talking...my mind wandered.

Before attempting to play along, you should already know all the major scale modes and the melodic minor scale.  Your alternate picking should already be very controlled/synchronized and you should be experienced with string skipping.  It also contains some extreme finger stretches/intervals that a lot of people might never be able to do (a shorter scale neck or extraordinary long fingers will come in handy here).

If you don't already have the skills mentioned above, I highly recommend Don Latarski's ""Guitar Theory Basics"" and Frank Gambale's ""Chopbuilder"" be bought first.  Sequentially, they'll introduce you to all the basic mode fingerings and get your alternate picking, control and speed somewhat closer to Paul's level."
3143,739040375,4,"I've been playing guitar for years and years. Have many books, CD's, etc. This is my first on ""shred"" techniques... holy cow! It's like I'm back to square one.. but that's good.. basic techniques are well presented in logical format. I was able to move through some of this fairly quickly, in theory, but still working on speed speed speed! Wish there was TAB for Vol. 1, but I found that online. Vol. 2 tab is included in PDF on disk. Would be nice if there was something to paly along with, it's presented and you're off on your own to practice. All that said, it's a good bang for the buck... plenty of good techniques and lessons to work on for a long long time."
3144,739040375,5,"Within a month I have already notice some serious improvements in my playing.  Particularly my picking is much cleaner.  Also, it's nice to add some more licks to my library...I was getting pretty bored with my playing for a while, but this video has revived my playing once again!"
3145,739040375,5,"This video guitar lesson is for those who want to get a bit more technical into their repertoire. Intense Rock 1 has old school Paul (good old Racer X days) teaching us the basics of soloing, scaling and just good guitar playing overall. I like how he also incorporates funny skits in between sessions which is great cos learning guitar is meant to be a fun experience too (in his case anyways). Intense Rock 2 kinda builds on the first, introducing a few more patterns and sequences. Paul continues his humorous presentation keeping the audience awake and laughing. I play with a whammy bar so it's a bit of a shame PG doesn't like it too much but that's his playing style I guess.

Overall PG is a cool and fun down-too-Earth guitar teacher you won't be disappointed. Oh and did I mention he's the world's 4th fastest guitar player?"
3146,739040375,4,"Every budding shredder needs this. I'd give it a 5 star but it lacks a bit of technical detail. Gilbert is such a impeccable player though so just buy it anyway.

David
[...]"
3147,739040375,3,"I have been playing forms of rock/metal for a few years, but never really tried my hand at leads so I figured I would give this vid a shot.  I watched the video through a few times and obviously Paul is very good at what he teaches, but I got left in the dust right off the bat.  I eventually decided to focus on some of the easier patterns, memorize them and run though them everytime i pick up my guitar.  I am a lot faster now than before I started, but still nothing close to paul---even on the simple ones.  I would say this video is more for someone that can already play fairly fast and is either looking for more licks or wants to play faster.  Don't get me wrong it is a good vid, i just wish I were more up to speed when i bought it."
3148,739040375,3,"I read good reviews about this guy and this video. I even saw some clips of him on youtube and that convinced me to buy this. However when I got it and watched it, I noticed he went too fast in his instruction for me to keep up. My biggest gripe is that he does not teach you the rudimentary techniques such as how to hold the pick so that you can pick as fast as he is. I found myself pausing the video a lot just to get the lick. The DVD comes with a printable PDF booklet (13 pgs). This is def not for beginners. It would have been better if he started out showing you how to use a metronome in shredding and subdividing notes. The included sample vid with John Petrucci (he shows you shredding with a metronome) was what this video should have been."
3149,739040375,5,"I'd already seen a few of the lessons online and there was no doubt on what I was in for.

A detailed shred of shredding. And Paul Gilbert is a fantastic teacher. And a great artist. He really rips apart his own technique and shows you the light... the rest is up to you. Whether you have the motivation to DO and practice consistently and accurately.

If playing fast is the real thing on your mind. Just pick up this DVD and hear your self transform in a matter of months.

I used to have this fear of speed. Thanks Paul for dispelling completely. And making it accessible for mere mortals. While I still am not sure I can ever get to the clarity levels that he has on his fast ones... I am definitely not scared anymore to attempt to play fast...

Thank you very much Paul Gilbert."
3150,739040375,5,"There'd be a lot more amazing guitarists in the world.  Intense Rock I is mainly directed at improving technique providing a lot of different 3-note-per-string, string skipping and sweep arpeggios sequences.  Paul does a great job at breaking these things down while giving us a taste of his goofy sense of humor, but for my money Intense Rock II is king.  Among other things Paul covers dynamics and control, and the last segment on practicing alone is worth the money.  Do yourself a favor and pick this up, your guitar will thank you."
3151,739040375,5,"Paul Gilbert is one of the best guitarists in the world. Lucky for us, he's also a really down to earth guy and is a great teacher. While all of Paul's DVDs are great, Intense Rock helps you lay the groundwork to play shred metal.
From the first simple exercise to the last terror lick, Intense Rock is an exercise in the development of shred technique. Paul is a great teacher who actually slows down the licks and explains how he plays them. He certainly isn't too haughty to forget what it was once like to be a student. Pair this up with Troy Stetina's shred masterpiece, ""Speed Mechanics for the Lead Guitar,"" spend most of your free time practicing, and you'll be able to shred. (There's no great secret to technique! It takes time, drive, patience, and belief in one self.)

John Petrucci's Rock Discipline is highly recommended as well, since Petrucci, while less wacky and attention-grabbing than Gilbert, is a great teacher as well. Although, I would say it's better for those who've already bettered there technique, and have, thus, seen some concrete rewards for their playing. The Intense Rock ( and Speed Mechanics, for that matter) exercises are very musical, and are therefore easier for the beginning shredder to practice for an extended period of time, than Rock Discipline which has a lot of (valuable) atonal exercises."
3152,739040375,5,"Gilbert is a master player and instructor - and I think we all know that those two things don't necessarily go together.  His technique on this DVD is jaw dropping.  I really don't think it would be possible to alternate pick faster with the clarity Mr. Gilbert brings to the instrument.  Paul seems to have both sides of his brain fully developed - the artistic left side that rocks out with gut searing intensity and emotion, and the geeky analytical right side that can perfectly explain and break down why it all works.  I own literally thousands of guitar instructional materials that I've purchased over the last thirty years, and can honestly say that this DVD ranks in the top three.  If you are at all interested in shred guitar, you simply have to buy this.  Many of us paid $40 or more per VHS tape for the original videos (parts I and II), so this DVD is an amazing bargain at this price.  Thanks, Paul!"
3153,739040375,5,Anyone interested in improving their picking and articulation would be well advised to check out this DVD. There's enough here to keep a player occupied for quite a while. Volume two of this title really drives home the point of making those tasty shred licks musical. This DVD is a fantastic deal.
3154,739040375,5,"Paul is the master of fast guitar licks. I mean Wow!!
he teaching very valuable technique that is helping me improve my speed. I've got all the DVDs and bought them for my kids too! Thanks Paul!!!
Tommy G"
3155,739040375,5,"Paul's ability to teach is amazing.  VERY relevant and ALWAYS fun!  For 20 years now he has been and continues to keep things easily understood that are essential in taking your technique to a new level.  As a player whom has been playing for 30 years now myself, Paul's breakdown of left and right-hand technique finally got me over the ""hump"" I had not been able to overcome most of my guitar playing days as I finally overcame a plateau and quickly saw noticable improvment in speed and accuracy as I finally got the metronome setting to click higher than ever and still growing."
3156,739040375,5,"I have been playing guitar for more almost 20 years and I wish I had this DVD back when I was trying to develop my shred guitar technique. Couple this DVD with a book like Speed Mechanics by Stetina and you have all you need to start shredding. Paul is such a virtuoso shred player, he will blow you away with licks played at the speed of light!! He however slows  all these licks down and even shows every small detail in achieving these licks from alternate picking, sweeping, sequences, sweep-tap, legato and more!!You will also need a metronome and LOTS of practice time to learn these techniques. When you master them you won't regret it since you will playing with terrifying technique. If you want to play like Paul Gilbert and other master shredders out there, this is the DVD to start with. And for this price you can't go wrong."
3157,739040375,4,"Paul gilbert does a good job at explaining all the sequences. the only reason i don't give it a perfect rating is that part one gets kind of boring to watch, and you need to get through a lot of it in order to understand part 2."
3158,739040375,5,"I actually bought this video (vol 1) when I was 11 or 12 when it first came out with my allowance that I saved up. As a guitar teacher and someone with 20 plus years playing experience, I can say that this is the best video on shred guitar technique. Volume 1 alone is well worth the price. My only issue(a VERY minor one) is that he doesn't talk about the metronome and its usage. But any good teacher can explane that in about 2 minutes.
 Volume 2 while not quite as shred heavy is still a great dvd to have(and just as important content). It concetrates more on phrasing, dynamics, rythmic ways of building phrases, etc. Don't worry, there is still plenty of shredding as well.
 These volumes are the best investments I ever made as a guitar player,teacher and student. Anyone who wants to learn how to shred, get this dvd package, and a book on music theory(or instruction by a teacher) and a good chord book and you'll have everything you ever need.
 Keep in mind, no matter what, you still have to practice(alot!!!!). No book, Dvd, or anything is going to MAKE you play well. If you are a beginner(or even advanced), you still have to work hard. However, this is a big help."
3159,740318764,5,The whole family loves drive through dvd's and this one seems to be endowed with an extra dose of humor. I loan these dvd's out to all my friends. Maybe I should start charging rent?
3160,740318764,5,History should be told and it should be told truthfully.  The kids think these are funny and they are learning at that same time.  What better way to learn then when you are laughing.  My kids laugh and learn at the same time and that is a great way to learn.
3161,740318764,5,Dave Stotts and Focus on the Family hit another home run!  The entire series should be at least shown to school aged kids and it is great entertainment (and informative) for we adults too.
3162,740318764,5,"This video is an excellent supplement for American History studies, or anyone interested in learning about America's history.  It would be ideal for home schoolers.  Dave Stotts is goofy, but enjoyable to listen to and watch, as he sometimes dresses for the occasion or place to which he is visiting or talking about.  Seeing the video will make you want to visit for yourself."
3163,740318764,1,"I ordered several DVDs on early American history for my daughter.  We loved the PBS and Biography ones; this one was not to our taste.  First, the jokes are silly: he can't say croissant, he squeezes canned cheese on a croissant, he takes a call from his wife and asks for his snoopy toothbrush and spiderman underroos, etc.  Perhaps the intended audience is 4-6 year olds.  Second, they do not have the strongest historians on their writing staff.  e.g. He makes fun of Abigail Adams for her poor spelling, when at that time, spelling was not standardized.  You could make fun of the other founding fathers for the same flaw.  If you know American history, this DVD will drive you crazy with all the little mistakes...
p.s. this is presented by the National Day of Prayer."
3164,740318764,5,"I HIGHLY recommend the Drive Thru History (DTH) Discovering America's Founder Video, as well as ALL the Drive Thru History Programs. Dave Stotts has done an excellant job making history come alive, as well as make sense. Dave has a wonderful way of bringing these charaters come to life and how they relate to each other. A couple are relatives of mine, it was fun getting to know them, through this DVD. I've always appreciated history, but never in my 60 plus years of life, enjoyed learning it, until the Drive Thru History Programs. I stumbled across his program, when he first started on TV. His narrative made learning history fun for me, as well as connected history together, which may be the biggest difference. History text books did much to dry up my interest in History, where the DTH series woke up my desire for learning & understanding history. Great Job Dave & your fantastic team! Thanks for also providing a school program that will stimulate children (and adults) to understand our world's past. We have ALL the DTH DVDs and have purchased many as gifts.
Drive Thru History DVD's have always been appreciated gifts...All Programs/Episodes/Series are winners!!"
3165,740318764,5,Perfect educational item for car. Daughter hates learning...lol this made it a little more bearable.
3166,740318764,5,This is a great history series. We love drive thru history as well as the kids. Very educational as well as entertaining .
3167,740318764,5,Excellent
3168,740318764,5,Drive Thru History is awesome struff!
3169,740318764,5,Great
3170,740318764,5,"The Drive-Thru History series are exceptional.  These created an absolute thirst in my children for history.  The creators have captured a formula for fun, entertaining and engaging history lessons, which are truly informative and make an exceptional supplement to any American history study.  Thank you!"
3171,740318764,5,"So far, anything that David Stotts works on is spot-on.  He makes history interesting and my kids love it!!"
3172,740318764,5,I bought this for my special needs son who is very interested in the history of our country.  The information is presented in a way that he can relate to easily.  He really enjoys it!
3173,740318764,5,Dave Stotts takes individuals and elaborates on their contributions in history.  Has much information and great illustrations.  Dave has a great way of making it interesting and keeping your attention.  Great for all ages.  I highly recommend it.  Very well done.
3174,740318764,4,This is a good educational tool to use in the classroom to discuss the American Founders.  A good dvd to use in my classroom.
3175,740316591,5,GOOD MOVIE
3176,740316591,5,"This is must have DVD if you love fusion or jazz. The great Steve Gadd is grooving and such a refined musician. He makes the music special by his tatesful playing. The guys in the band are the Best in the business!! Amazing talent within this band consisting of: Michael Landau, Jimmy Johnson, Larry Goldings and Walt Fowler. The performance captured that night was a very special one. You must see this DVD if you love good musicians playing with excellent taste and spontaneity."
3177,740316591,3,"It's okay , but it's kind of boring. Does not have a well written plot line and does not end well. I would not buy it if I were you."
3178,740316591,5,Wonderful family movie.
3179,740316591,3,I have not read this book. Our librarian at my church suggested this to be ordered for our library. She has had some checkouts of this book and she reads the books before put on the shelves of the church library.
3180,740316591,5,brings to mind how servants to one another can become lastibg friendships. family oriented inspiring touching excellent family movie thanks
3181,740316591,4,"I liked this video. I had it on my ""wish list"" for quite a while and decided to get it. It is a family video and a christian themed video. I thought the actors were superb with Ruby Dee, Julie Harris among others. The story line of a man returning to his grandmother's house after she has suffered a stroke and he has suffered the suicide of his pregnant wife is sad but interesting as the viewer follows the characters to their respective ends. Without giving too much away, there is a sort of redemption for all characters, one way or another. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I felt that the video kind of left the story unfinished (at least in my opinion). You get the feeling that the main character will eventually return for good to his roots but you really do not know that and I felt sort of left at ""loose ends.""
Other than that, I really enjoyed the film and would recommend it. It reminds me a little of the Hallmark Hall of Fame videos."
3182,740316591,5,It is extremely rare for me to watch any movie more than once.  This is certainly the exception!  Beautifully written & produced with a realism rarely seen. The story will touch your heart.
3183,740316591,5,"This is a great, wholesome , heart touching , family film that i would recommend without reservation."
3184,740325124,5,"I love this workout. The set is beautiful. At first I thought it was going to be all down-dogs. I'm a lifelong migrainer and downdogs make myhead pound with pain. But there is so much after that!  It's a little slow, which is fine with me , but the workouts are very graceful and all of the poses I'm used to. It's a total body workout. I rented this, but I'm going to buy it!"
3185,740325124,5,"My wife found all of Tonya Larson to be very helpful in getting back to shape with a newborn.  The routine was challenging but nothing she couldn't manage after a few weeks postpartum.  My favorite part is the spiritual warmups.  I watched them and was super impressed.  As a pastor I see all kinds of spiritual nonsense but her message was refreshing and accurate.  For the right person, it could even be life changing."
3186,740325124,5,"Thanks Tonya for a lovely stretching and toning routine. It is a very relaxing workout and the music is lovely. Yes, it is a Christian-centered workout with soft Christian vocals and instrumental music. I am a Christian, so I was very familiar with the lyrics and tunes. They were very modern versions and had a nice ambiant feel to them. I love all of Tonya's workouts and appreciate her Spiritual Warm-Ups and everything about her routines. This was a yoga-based routine, but she used no yoga terminalogy in describing the moves. It was very professional. I do, however enjoy a lot of yoga routines that do use the authentic yoga/sanskrit names and words. I love Raviana workouts too. Tonya is very professional, and soft-spoken and the set,music and the mats and their outfits were nice and modern. I really like this one and you can use it in segments or do the whole thing!"
3187,740325124,5,Good workout.  I love it!  It is a very good stretch and muscle building workout with the bonus of a christian worshipful aspect.
3188,740325124,2,"The title on this exercise DVD does not really match the actual content. ""Yoga-Lite for Biblical Worship after Childbirth"" may be a better title.

Tonya leads a gentle, soft yoga practice (not powerful as in the title) geared towards intermediate practitioners. There is not a lot of sculpting performed in the practice, although her Yoga routine can provide some toning. She provides very little instruction or beginner options so I would not recommend it if you're looking for a beginner's stretching routine. For instance, during Chaturanga (slow downward movement plank), she does not give the option to lower your knees first, then goes into the full upward dog position. She does bridge pose (an advanced yoga posture) with very little instruction and poor form.

Also, if you're looking for a non-demoninational practice, this is not the DVD for you. She talks specifically about God, Jesus, and Repenting and includes quotes from the bible during what's called the ""Spritual Warm-Up"", which assumes all spiritual practitioners believe in God and follow the Bible. It felt more like a sermon/lecture to me. This turned me off, specifically since it's marketed as a regular ""stretching"" video.

The practice is somewhat weak, Tonya's voice is too soft and she does not provide clear enough queues so you have to look up quite often to follow her routine. Moveover, the music is too load and has church-based singing which even more overpowers her delicate voice.

The introduction video section has Tonya and her single student showing their new babies. It is commendable that they both just gave birth and have made a video. All the proceeds go to ""Acres 4 Life"" which helps people in Africa learn to farm their land, which is awesome! I really appreciate their efforts and work helping people with their loving kindness, but again, it would be better to be straight forward in their marketing that their efforts have religious undertones. It's not that I don't support them, but they should be clear on the cover of the DVD that the proceeds will be used for religious-based projects.

If you're looking for a couple excellent (non-demoninational) well produced stretching DVD's, I would recommend the following:

3189,740325124,5,"Great workout/stretch video without all the new age yoga crap. Recommended for people who want to do ""yoga"" but don't agree with all the hokey stuff."
3190,740325124,5,"I love it, my whole family loves this. Very simple and easy to follow, each workout seems about 10 minutes in length!"
3191,740325124,5,"I've been enjoyingenjoying this workout for a few years. It is not aerobically rigorous, yet it is just want my tight body needs to stretch and even strengthen some core muscles. It definitely improves my posture and eased me out of pain in my neck and back."
3192,740325124,1,"I thought I was watching an exercise video instead she's quoting the Bible. This is garbage, if I want to read the Bible I'll do it on my own time. very deceiving"
3193,740325124,2,"Nice idea, but incredibly slow moving."
3194,740325124,5,"I like Tonya's spiritual, calm approach."
3195,740325124,5,Excellent!  I just finished this workout!  I am a beginner a felt intructions were easy to follow & moves doable for new be!  Loved it that Tonya incorporated Christian mind body focus!  That was the most delightful suprise!  There are many non- Christian focus exercise video that those less than kind with their review should check out.  Tonya was honoring her core values & produce an excellent & worthy of 5 stars exercise video!  Where is the respect for Tonya Larson's Christian beliefs?  Reviewing on exercise alone is 5 stars!  Kudos Tonya Larson.  I will check out to see if you have others.  May God bless you & expand your territory!
3196,740325124,5,"I really like this video! Even though it says it's great for a postpartum workout, it's perfect for me. I'm in my 50s and have some minor back problems. I needed something to get me stretching and working my muscles, and these stretches have really helped. I like that it's divided into several different stretch sequences, so if I don't have time to do the entire video I can pick which one or two sequences I want to do. When I first started , I could barely bend because of my back and the condition my muscles were in at the time. I'm doing so much better now and am able to do a lot of the stretches I couldn't even think of doing in the beginning. This has been a wonderful addition to my life and has really helped me physically."
3197,740325124,5,Wonderful relaxing program to follow.
3198,740325124,1,Slow and boring. I think she quoted a bible verse.
3199,740325124,5,Love the Christian background  music.
3200,740325124,4,"It is good Practice , I want to know more about the right methods for breathing"
3201,740325124,1,Too religious for my taste. Others may like spirituality with exercise.  I don't
3202,740325124,2,"I'm not sure if I should fault the video or Amazon's description - but being blindsided with a Christian prayer sesh is Not ok. I think we all can agree that everyone is free to be whatever religion they want, therefore, tricking viewers via lack of information is sneaky, rude, and disrespectful. I finished the video regardless and found the stretches to be nice and relaxing (and that is the ONLY reason it is getting two stars) but I agree with other commenters that ""power"" and ""sculpt"" have no business being in the title and description.

Also - to other commenters that were complaining that yoga doesn't fit their religion -- well -- yoga is an Indian lifestyle practice. It's more than just exercises and poses to them. If you are going to partake - have some respect and appreciation for something outside of your comfort zone. If you faith is so easily shaken, I hardly think that's yoga's fault."
3203,740325124,4,Was just what I needed to stretch and relax my body.
3204,740325124,4,It's a quiet but sure way to exercise and telax at the same time every part of your body. Very long though.
3205,740325124,5,I was looking to start stretching and exercising. I was in Awe when I turned on this video to see that the Lord works in many ways. A Christian based yoga video right at my feet. I have never come across a excersize video with scripture. It helped me through the stretches to know that the Lord was with me through this whole video. Great stretches and very relaxing.
3206,740325124,5,Awesome work out
3207,740325124,4,"Wonderful video.  Only complaint is that I'd prefer to hold the stretches longer.  Plus, I don't care for the first 5 minutes used for prayer.  Don't need to hear the same prayer every single time.  I just fast forward through it."
3208,740325124,3,"easy to keep up with. basic yoga moves.
i'll use it again when i can't get to the gym and want a good stretch."
3209,740325124,1,Jebus. Religious nutjobbery. Fair warning would have saved me some time.
3210,740325124,5,"Great yoga workout!  Loved the opening scripture and prayer.  It is refreshing to do a yoga routine not packed to new-age mumbo jumbo, telling you to become one with the earth and such!  Loved the background music.  Will definitely buy more of her dvds."
3211,740325124,3,"Should've read the reviews, very religious and postnatal.  Seems like a great lesson, just not for me.  Would've been great if they would allow the viewer to choose a religious/postnatal atmosphere or not."
3212,740325124,5,This is a really great workout.
3213,740325124,5,I loved that this is a Christian video!
3214,740325124,5,"I am enjoying this video, taking it slow. I like her attitude."
3215,740325124,5,"As someone who loves the physical and health benefits of yoga but am not attracted to the spiritual aspect of it, I find that this exercise program is excellent for Christians who are in the same boat I am in. I can see why someone of a non-religious background would dislike both this and more spiritual yoga programs, but I think it is really excellent for Christians who seek an alternative to yoga that is more focused on their own values. Highly recommend. It is a deeply prayerful way to do effective exercise."
3216,740325124,4,"This was a great stretch routine with elements of yoga and sculpting that was not overly difficult or strenuous. I don't know if it earns it's ""Power"" in the title, but it was effective, especially if you aren't feeling high-energy, but want to get in some work. There is a little Bible-reference ""spiritual"" warm-up at the beginning."
3217,740325124,2,Didn't realize it was post-natal
3218,740325124,5,love it
3219,740325124,5,Love this video. 3 times a week. Prefect stretch and light workout.
3220,740325124,2,Not for me.
3221,740325124,5,Helps so much.
3222,740325124,1,I didn't choose this DVDs to get bible quotes from a fitness instructor.  Had to turn it off.
3223,740325124,1,I did not order this.
3224,740325124,5,I've been looking for a good Stretch Workout for a while and this is perfect. The scripture reference and prayer at the beginning was a pleasant surprise. I felt totally worked out and stretched at the end.
3225,740325124,5,Very easy to flow!
3226,740325124,5,Easy to follow. Love it is a Christian based workout!
3227,740325124,5,"Awesome if your a beginner. Love , love love the fact that this is a Christian based video."
3228,740325124,5,"I've always been skeptical of yoga, but this one actually made me break a sweat. It was also somehow easy enough that I could follow along."
3229,740325124,5,I enjoyed the workout.
3230,740325124,2,She is  OK.
3231,740325124,4,It definitely grows on you. Can fast forward if you don't want the meditation. It works!
3232,740325124,1,I do not want to listen to Bible scripture while I am stretching/working out. No thank you.
3233,740325124,5,I love this video.
3234,740325124,1,"This video came up in my search for a Prime stretch workout.  It just isn't a very good workout video.  It's a nice Christian video, but I can go to Church for that."
3235,740325124,4,"I was looking for a stretching workout that was not Yoga and this is a great fit! It has a spiritual aspect that appears Christian by the use of a pre-workout prayer and the music. I found the exercises to be challenging yet doable. It isn't yoga but uses movements that are yogalike for those who might be uncomfortable with yoga's spiritual connections. My only dislike is that the quality of the video is sometimes pixilated but I'm not sure if that is my TV, internet connection, or the video."
3236,740325124,1,Not for me!
3237,740325124,4,"Great music, relaxing feel, good stretches."
3238,740325124,3,"What was with all the Christian bullsh*?

I guess they don't care about including the culture that developed these stretches...

It's all yoga, and that came from Hinduism. At least don't say anything so all cultures can participate w/out feeling excluded."
3239,740325124,5,"When you need a deep, good stretch and when you appreciate the Christian tone, this is great. It's far slower than you would think when you read the title, but as someone who is just interested in getting a good stretch, this is great and refreshing."
3240,740325124,5,"This is basically yoga mixed with some calisthenics, which is what I was hoping for when I clicked this. And when I say yoga I mean the whole shebang, like the meditation, the spiritual music, etc. But there's a twist: It's Christianized. Granted, after the first 5 minutes there aren't really any references to Christianity except what I think is Christian music in the background (but the lyrics weren't clear enough for me to find it interruptive). I loved the workout, I skipped the meditation and prayer at the beginning. I am a religious person, but I didn't click the video for worship, so I skipped that part."
3241,740325124,5,"I've never written a review before but I just finished this stretch/strengthen video. I completely understand the dissatisfaction of non-Christian viewers with this video. I'm new to the yoga scene and the Buddha/zen religious elements of many practices are a real turn-off to me. In fact I almost turned this one off when the first heading came up with ""spiritual"" in the title. Invariably in the yoga world that means I have to listen to someone become one with the universe or some such thing. I was pleasantly surprised when Tonya began quoting from Isaiah and then Matthew. If you are a Christian looking for a good stretch or to start incorporating yoga into your routine, this is a workout that not only won't offend your faith but actually enriches it. Thank you Tonya!"
3242,740325124,2,"The description of this video misuses commas. The vibe is creepy Christian, and I don't appreciate that that was a surprise. Also, it's not ""power stretch and sculpt."" It's just dull vinyasa yoga."
3243,740325124,4,Great yoga workout - just like the Body Flow Yoga class I used to attend.  Now I can do it at home whenever I want!  I use it also as a great stretch routine after a hard workout.  Love it!
3244,740325124,2,"I didn't realize that there would be such a religious element to this video. In the beginning she quoted scripture from the Bible. I didn't mind that so much because I normally skip through the talking of all the videos I do....but moving into the second phase of the stretching the music changed from wordless songs to a hymn....I think was ""I Surrender All"".....It just isn't my thing. I found it distracting and ultimately defeated the purpose of me buying the video which was to relax.... I turned it off after a little while. I wish I had been able to rent it first because it as a complete waste to me. However, if you are looking for something easy and relaxing with a Christian emphasis this is definitely for you."
3245,740325124,5,"I used this dvd in my day off from exercise and It is very relaxing on my body, it makes me feel great, I really enjoyed it."
3246,740325124,3,"I usually do vinyassa flow yoga, and wanted something to just concentrate on stretching.  This was not the video for me.  While she did have some good stretches, it was very easy and slow moving.  I got very bored.  The title ""power stretch"" mislead me... It should have been restfull stretch for beginners.  Wish I had rented it instead of buying it because I will not be doing the video again."
3247,740325124,5,"This is a Christian Beginner to Intermediate Stretching and Toning Workout using a mostly instrumental Christian devotional music soundtrack, NOT a Yoga workout. Christians will enjoy practicing these Yoga-like stretching and toning exercises without the pagan religious overtones. Separate from the workout, the DVD also contains several lovely, short Christian devotionals to motivate and inspire participants in their journey toward better health and fitness. If you love the Bible and the One True God and His Son revealed in it, this Christ-centered stretching and toning workout will be a big blessing to you."
3248,757915655,5,"This book plus the dvd is a must to the beginning double bassist. I haven't found much on the subjet and when I came across this book and dvd I was totally mesmerized. Excersizes r great the way its set up is really cool. A very inspiring methode. Rufus Reid is very clear in what he says and teaches.

If you think its expensive well its worth the investment."
3249,757915655,5,"I had owned this book for a while and only recently discovered this video existed. Reid is a master jazz bassist and the material of this sort is rare so I ordered it. I was not disappointed. This DVD is really priceless, having a master sit and give you a couple hours of personal tips and demonstration is something that even if you could get it (and as a beginner it would be nigh impossible), it would cost 10x or more.

This isn't quite an 'absolute beginners' lesson, you will need another video to give you tips on setup of a new bass and that kind of thing. This is the kind of video that you can watch over and over and keep learning new things, or just gaining renewed inspiration.

So, if you are a double bassist, or even an electric player interested in the acoustic, and you could benefit from some

lessons from a world class player, then buy this, you won't be disappointed."
3250,757915655,5,"I came to bass playing in my late 30s after a lifetime of playing mainly guitar, banjo and mandolin, and I went through a lot of books looking for a clear and solid foundation for upright jazz playing.
Of all the methods out there, Reid's is the one that has really stood the test of time, and for good reason. He starts the reader off with basic scales and simple patterns for playing over changes. From there it's on through more complex scales and  patterns and finally, soloing, illustrated with a number of transcribed classics.
Combine this book with the Simandl book for basic technique (and a good library of jazz albums), and you have just about everything needed to guide the beginning bass player through the intermediate stage. For a player who already had a basic classical technique, this book alone is just about all that's needed to learn to play jazz."
3251,757915655,5,"""The Evolving Bassist"" has come to be the standard bass method book in the world of jazz.  In it, Rufus Reid explains his ""concept"" of playing bass, moving beyond merely playing quarter notes to progressive and thoughtful bass lines.
As the title of the book indicates, this is a process.  The book is designed for players of any level to develop a well-rounded approach to the bass.
The main portion of the method includes etudes, scales, and standard patterns for Latin bass lines, Rock bass lines, etc.  Also included are many practical hints, answers to frequently asked questions, discography, and transcriptions of a number of Mr. Reid's compositions.
""The Evolving Bassist"" is all around an excellent aid for the growing jazz bass player."
3252,757915655,5,"Mr. Reid covers everything!!!  Gear, instruments, amps, cables... then how to play the thing!  Electric or Double bass.  Amazing photos of Rufus demonstrating how to get your bass on a plane... How to position hands/fingers on Double Bass, Electric and the Bass VI.  The only book I know of that addresses the Fender Bass VI and explores its potential as a means to expanding soloing possibilities for any bassist with Bass VI specific excercises."
3253,757915655,4,No Problem
3254,757915655,5,"Rufus Reid is a Master of the genre (Jazz) and his instrument(Double Bass)! I always learn from Rufus when he speaks and I, in turn, pass the knowledge onto my private bass students! Thank, Mr. Rufus Reid...much Respect! I highly recommend others to purchase this DVD!"
3255,757915655,3,"Reid is a great philosopher and entertainer, and the concert  part of the DVD is awesome. He doesn't teach a lot, though."
3256,757915655,5,"I love this DVD! Rufus not only breaks it down, but shows it in the trio setting how it works. If you're a beginner, this really isn't for you, but still you can learn the theory side from. For the beginner, I recommend Todd Phillips DVD 1 & 2, and workout. Get those along with this DVD, you'll be working for days."
3257,757915655,5,Excellent teaching tool to go along with Rufus Reid's book. I found just watching it as a video without even having my hands on my bass was wonderful. Each time one watches you pick up more and more information. The trio performances are fanastic.
3258,757915655,5,Great book for beginners and for those who want to learn how to play bass very quickly. Excellent presentation. Thanks!
3259,757915655,5,The evolving Bassist is a great source of technique essentials.  I was put onto it by my tutor and it has been a huge help.
3260,757915655,5,"I had this book for several years and misplaced it  and purchased it a gain. This is the standard to get a student playing all over the acoustic bass. All bass students should have this book in their library.

Bird"
3261,757915655,5,"I recommend you get a handful of lessons and some background before you get into this book. There are some questions you might have that could be tough to answer without the benefit of a teacher.

Having said that, this is a great book. It really starts with complete beginner basics, and builds from there. You're playing will grow with each section. You'll get out of it what you put into it with this book - which can be a ton.

Whether you apsire to play jazz or not, this book can open you up as a bassist and give you many tools to use."
3262,757915655,4,"This book offers a lot of good knowledge for bassplayers especially for the double bass players. My favorities are open string and walkin' bass excersises. I am a bass teacher and I use this book a lot in my lessons. The new millenium edition (2000) has better fonts and notations than older editions. So it is much easier to play those lessons.  There are some things I would have wanted, for example how to play scales in one and two octaves. But there are lots of books that show the scales and chords etc. I fully recommend this book for all bass players and teachers in all levels."
3263,757915655,4,"This is a great book to be played, not read! Following the book will result in a more thorough understanding of the bass fingerboard as it applies to the harmonic foundation of bass playing."
3264,757915655,5,"When I was in high school in the 1980s, I studied bass. Not that I could play it. I have Cerebral Palsy. For our purposes, my mind could do the walking. My fingers could not.

But The Evolving Bassist was one of the main texts my teacher used. Buy this, and it will keep you busy for a very long time, whether you study double or electric bass.

Rufus Reid is a jazz bass player, and this book teaches you through jazz. It goes from the most basic whole, half, quataer, eighth and sixteenth note exercises, and slowly shows you how to build walking lines. These increase in complication, and if you hit the end of this book, no easy task, you will be at least a good jazz player, ready to play whatever type of music you want.

I never did get there- I and my spastic little ten appendages  went to university and learned two more instruments--a typewriter and, later, a computer. You judge the results.

I did, however, get to both see and meet Reid: he taught at what was then William Paterson College-now university, and used to play there on Sunday afternoons. Twenty minutes from where I grew up.  He also has at least one good album out,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rufus-Reid-Trio-Perpetual-Stroll-LP-Vinyl/dp/B0019BI5OC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rufus Reid Trio: Perpetual Stroll [ LP Vinyl </a>]"
3265,757915655,5,The product arrived within a few days after ordering. It was in perfect condition. Very happy with using Amazon.
3266,757915655,5,"Learning to improve my jazz playing (being a mainly classical player) is made easier by this book, Reed was a brilliant bass methodologist and there is a lot to learn in this book."
3267,757915655,5,"This is a great book for any jazz instrumentalist who plays in concert pitch.  Because of the many etudes written in quarter notes, it'd probably even be a good way to practice transposing on the fly.  It's ideal for understanding bass lines, reading in bass clef, and absorbing underlying jazz solo ideas and structures.  According to my practice diary, I started studying from it about ten months ago.  My playing has improved and changed since using this book, and I don't even play the bass (I've been playing jazz guitar for 20+ years).  It's helped me outline chords better, think in a lower register, and think about function while playing--like use of passing tones in jazz, etc.  Reid's encouraging remarks, scattered throughout the book, are a warm, personal touch, which I think would be very good for a young musician to read.  I admire Rufus Reid as a player, and think he did a real service to jazz musicians when he wrote this book.  THIS WOULD MAKE A GREAT GIFT FOR ANY JAZZ MUSICIAN!"
3268,757915655,5,"Rufus Reid has an easy going, but very knowledgeable way of getting across music concepts. He doesn't rush things and he is very systematic in his explanations.  I enjoy listening to what he has to say about music and  ""stand up"" bass playing in particular.  I am a teacher (but not a music teacher), and I am also a learner. This guy knows his stuff! Rufus Rules!"
3269,757915655,4,"I think this is a good book for those already able to find their way around a bass fingerboard. This book has lots to offer for those interested in improving their jazz technique. However, I needed to take lessons in order to learn correct fingerings/positions before getting into this book."
3270,757915655,5,"Rufus Reid's revised edition of the classic ""Evolving Bassist"" is a literal tour de force and a must have for all bass players regardless of what level of proficiency they play at.  The companion DVD (available separately and highly recommended) is a gem in which Rufus jams with two of the finest contemporary musicians illustrating various aspects of the text.  The DVD is worth the price just as a performance video.

While loosely defined as a method, the ""Evolving Bassist"" is really more of a well thought out approach to playing the instrument.  The skills taught follow several threads of theory and practice, but it's not a beginner tutorial even though very early players will benefit from the material...and continue to benefit throughout their playing career.  If one is desirous of a more basic text in the jazz genre then you must get ""The Michael Moore Bass Method"", probably the best tutorial currently available; the classical  ""Simandl"" material notwithstanding.  The two books and the ""Evolving..."" DVD really are complimentary and easily stand at the forefront of a limited field.  Highly recommended."
3271,757915655,5,"I first bought this book in 1979 and have been using a version of it since then with my bass students. This new edition is very good and the DVD isa great asset. Rufus is an understanding teacher and if you get a chance to attend one of his master classes, don't pass them up."
3272,764000969,3,"I did this video for the second time to give it another chance, but to be honest I'm not all that crazy about it because I am still in the process of learning yoga & although the instructor Sara Ivanhoe is friendly & doesn't use confusing yoga terms I won't be using this again.  The ""downward dog"" pose is done way too much on this video & held for quite some time.  I had to get back down on my hands & knees since I had trouble holding the pose.  One good thing is that there is someone doing modified poses & another woman who is EXTREMELY flexible doing the more advanced poses.  My only favorite part was the end where you lie on your back on the floor & you take the time breathing as your body relaxes.  I personally LOVE Karen Voight's Streamline Fitness which is composed of 2 segments, the 1st consisting of a 25 minute workout with weights & the 2nd segment (30 minutes long) my absolute fave which consists of abdominal work which you WILL feel the next day, followed by a wonderful yoga segment.  You can choose to do both workout segments in one day or alternate.  Karen explains the poses so you're not trying to hold a pose & trying to look at the T.V. at the same time. Plus this is so easy to follow & this was the first video I attempted yoga with! I'd much rather stick to my Streamline fitness video."
3273,764000969,5,"I've had this tape for a little over a year, and I still reach for it quite often. The instructor is warm and friendly and explains how to get into each pose with percision. I always feel loose and relaxed after doing this workout. This is the tape that made me want to try even more yoga tapes to expand my practice! I recommend it to everyone I know just starting out. The price can't be beat and neither can the style. Although I have aquired more tapes recently, this tape will stay in my yoga practice for a long time to come!"
3274,764000969,4,"I fondly imagined that this would be a gentle stretch to soothing music, so was rather challenged by quite a tough workout. One thing, do have a proper mat. My knees did not do well on a towel and I had to purchase a  good mat before I could repeat the workout. Further to other reviews, the  instructor's very affected speech patterns were annoying and distracting,  but not enough to take away from the fact that I will use this tape again  and again."
3275,764000969,2,"I can't recommend this video!  There wasn't enought ""meat"" in this video to provide much of a yoga workout and the instruction needs improvement.  The instructor's voice and annoying cadence was enough to  make me toss the video."
3276,764005529,4,"Wow!  I love this movie!  My younger brother and I used to watch it with our family all the time-it was our favorite.  When I finally put two and two together and realized Michael Crawford was Woody-I loved it even more!  I totally agree that the truck turned race car is the coolest, and the guy  with the silver eye.  My friends and I have been looking for this forever!  Now we can watch it endlessly in our dorm rooms!"
3277,764005529,5,"Soar to hilarious heights with Michael Crawford..definitely a must see for all Michael Crawford fans.....funny, romantic, never boring..good family film.."
3278,764005529,1,This copy has been cropped.  I thought it would be like the VHS version...but it's not even that good.  Derpy movie that's fun because it can't try harder but formatting is disappointing.  I'd return it if I could.
3279,764005529,5,Adorable classic movie!!!
3280,764005529,5,My boys and I saw this when it first came out and I still own the Beta (yes!) copy of it.  Nice to be able to see it again - good flashback for us.
3281,764005529,5,"I am so glad that Disney has brought these back. I loved this as a kid and watched these on VHS that we borrowed on the library. Goofy antics, action and a little romance! Our kids ages 11,9, and 4 loved it. It held their attention, and we could hear the laughter as they watched it for the second time in 2 days. This is a good, wholesome movie to be shared with the family and friends!"
3282,764005529,5,Good movie for fans of Michael Crawford.
3283,764005529,5,Very enjoyable movie.
3284,764005529,5,Old time favorite.
3285,764005529,5,Great
3286,764005529,5,I used to watch this movie all the time when I was younger....so glad I found it!!!!
3287,764005529,5,Watched this when I was in Germany and found it great.  I had to get it for my kids
3288,764005529,5,Such a treat to watch! It's not a great movie but the ridiculousness of it makes it worth the watch over and over and over again.
3289,764005529,5,Fun blast from the past! My tweens were in stitches.
3290,764005529,5,"Condorman was a family favorite growing up. It's cheesy, cute and funny...and it's clean! A great movie for the whole family. The quality is a bit rough as the movie is quite dated, but it's still enjoyable. You can't beat seeing Michael Crawford (the original Phantom in Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage production of Phantom of the Opera) in his lovable comedian role as a comic book writer/artist thrown into the world of real life spies and Russian hitmen."
3291,764005529,5,Great fun!
3292,764005529,3,"The good:  It's a cheesy '80s movie from my youth
The bad: It's a cheesy '80s movie from my youth

Seriously I wouldn't waste my time on it if I hadn't seen it 30+ years ago."
3293,764005529,4,A family favorite. Not the best movie in the Disney collection but it's enjoyable to say the least.
3294,764005529,5,"Barbara Carrera!!!!!!! Michael Crawford!!!!!! Disney's James Bond is not to be missed. Porches, jet rods ,the condormobile, a bellydancer, a laser cannon, jetboats. Europe in full form (Paris, the Alps, Yugoslavia).
AND THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LOVE INTEREST.
It has it Allllllll."
3295,764005529,5,My favorite movie of all time in a widescreen format!! Looks great! Great condition! Mailed promptly!
3296,764005529,5,the problem with this film is theres no clear cut case of the villians are there really any villians in this film none that i could figure out. oliver reed s charcter krokov cant really be considered a villian primarily because theres no motive to any of what he does. from what i got out of him hes just a top russian agent with no real motive. films just a excuse to have great stunts and  a crazy plot that goes nowhere. see what you can salvage out of this one theres likeable stuff just no plot motivation.
3297,764005529,5,Quite simply one of the greatest films of all time
3298,764005529,4,Just as I remember it when I watched it as a kid. Great nostalgia.
3299,764005529,5,"So corny! So imaginative! So fun! It has that ""he's stuck in an impossible situation, he has no skill, but somehow he always escapes"" feel to it. After all he is Condorman!"
3300,764005529,4,"This DVD is presented in its theatrical 2.35:1 widescreen format but it is NOT anamorphic (enhanced for widescreen TVs), even though packaging claims it was ""digitally remastered."" Very disappointing, especially for a product released in 2011 and selling for $27-$35. Another homerun, Disney."
3301,764005529,1,"I'm sorry, but I guess I misunderstood ""non-usa format"" so was unable to view the movie from the dvd, but did watch it on my computer. The movie was excellent except I wanted to keep it and watch when ever I wanted to."
3302,764005529,5,Fun! In classic Disney fashion
3303,764005529,5,Love this movie
3304,764005529,5,"Loved this silly movie from the 80's. We watched it as kids, so brings back fun memories."
3305,764005529,4,A fun Disney movie from when Disney was more interested in making entertaining movies than in being politically correct.
3306,764005529,4,I liked it. Thanks :)
3307,764005529,5,"Delivered early, works great!"
3308,764005529,5,Super big number one america condorman cowboy makes precious good movie! Number one A plus!
3309,764005529,3,"I liked this movie, but it was predictable and simple. Although the plot was worn, I enjoyed most parts of the movie. The quality is decent and the movie is worth a try."
3310,764005529,5,"Classic movie!! Glad to see it being offered on DVD. Quality recording. Great for the ""lil superheroes"" as it offers some comic relief and kid friendly action scenes. Adults should find their attention held as well. Highly recommend for young families."
3311,764005529,5,They movie has everything a kid from the 80s would want.
3312,764005529,5,Ordered this by mistake thought I was getting a DVD
3313,764005529,4,"Childhood favorite.

Grew up loving this movie and i'm incredibly excited to finally own a digital copy of it!

however... I did notice that the main female role in the movie does not at all pass ""the test of time""  As a child i loved the movie. As an adult i notice that the main female role (KGB agent) is portrayed as being weak. Hard to imagine a ""top KGB agent"" as being so passive and unable to care for herself at all."
3314,764005529,5,"Loved this as a kid. It's still corny, but awesome."
3315,764005529,3,"Made on the heels of the success of Superman (1978) and not afraid to drop names, this is not quite a superhero film. It is more akin to a 007 spy film, even if at times it resembles the Pink Panther films, being filmed in several European locations and even with music by Henry Mancini. A better photographer and a better director could have done wonders with just that.

The first event in an Istanbul cafe is quite close to a Clouseau movie, but it quickly distances itself from that feel.

The film was quite ambitious for that Disney period, with lots of potentially exciting chases (which never quite get there,) we get custom spy cars & a Rolls-Royce chase, laser shooting speedboats, a sky lift escape, a helicopter and a mechanical wing contraption, which sometimes works and sometimes does not.

Oliver Reed as the villain is an absolute mess, but the two male leads (Michael Crawford and James Hampton) have a quirky relationship that brings to mind The Greatest American Hero (also 1981) down to even having a toothy lead with curly blond hair. Too bad there is no chemistry with Barbara Carrera.

While the description might superficially resemble Kick-Ass (2010), the movie features a comic book artist living out his heroic fantasies, one has really nothing to do with the other.

The animated title sequence is by Richard Williams? The DVD has no end credits."
3316,764005529,5,love it very family friendly old fashioned like a Pollyanna movie with action.
3317,764005529,5,well done
3318,764005529,3,"Campy Disney fun and a nice spoof on James Bond and spy movies of the day.  Barbara Carrera (""Natalia"") was also in one of the Bond movies, so the spy movie connection is fun."
3319,764005529,5,"Best movie disney made in 1981...
I saw it 32 times....
Michael Crawford is the best actor and
an awesome opera singer ...
I'm getting the DVD...
I had it on VHS...
OMG"
3320,764005529,5,"Can I give this 5 diamonds? The stars just don't seem sufficient. This movie masterpiece is truly one of our generations finest films.
Forget Godfather, forget glitter, forget them all, this is the one you've been looking for.
Woody is not only a lovable and believable hero, he steals your heart. This spy/love story will keep you enthralled and captivated. At times you may start rooting for Morovich because, PORSCHE, what else do I need to say. Those 911's are the star of the movie. I rewind and watch the chase scene again and again.
I want to believe it's all possible. I want to... believe."
3321,764005529,5,fast and awesome product thank you.
3322,764005529,5,Fan freaking tastic. Just as awesome as I remember it from when I  was a kid.
3323,764005529,5,"Our grandsons (10, 8, 7) and we watched it together. They had seen it once with their mother and were eager to share this with us. We had watched it when it first came out - with their mother! We had a blast. the kids enjoyed the innovation, they are all committed to becoming comic creators, and of course, who doesn't like the ""least likely"" to become the super-hero."
3324,764005529,5,I love this movie! The nerd gets the girl!
3325,764005529,4,I have fond memories of this movie as a kid and now my boys who are 8 and 10 loved it as well. A fun family movie.
3326,764005529,5,takes me back to when I was a kid....... love this movie
3327,764005529,5,very funny and clean movie for the whole family....I'm a picky family movie watcher and this one is a family favorite.
3328,764005529,5,An over looked Disney classic. great spoof on spy movies
3329,764005529,5,Great family friendly adventure.  Lots of laughs.
3330,764005529,5,"Loved it then, my family loves it now. Spoofy action movie."
3331,764005529,5,Funny
3332,764005529,3,"Let's get one thing straight: Condorman is not a great movie.  It's mindless camp, something you watch for fun, not for believability.  With that in mind, I absolutely love it.  It's one of the guilty pleasures of my childhood, when I didn't understand what made a movie ""good"" or ""bad""; I just enjoyed watching them.

I rented it the other day to show my son because I wanted him to experience the same joy that I did when I was not much older than him, and I was not disappointed: he had a great time and asked to see it again.  I just wish it were available on Netflix, but Disney's pretty stingy about what services it lets its movies be streamed on.

I enjoy the cheesy car and boat chases, with spontaneous explosions everywhere.  I love the villain, Krokov, and his over the top acting.  I wince at the inherent sexism of the ""guy rescues girl"" plot.  I laugh at the simplistic special effects of the Condorman suit, and Woody's insane audacity in confronting the entire KGB security apparatus for his Laser Lady.  It's just plain mindless fun."
3333,764005529,5,"I just got the Region 2 Disney UK DVD of Condorman in the mail today and instantly put it in the player.

I am fairly certain that I saw this in the theater and then a million times on the Disney Channel, but have not seen it since the mid 80's when I was very young.

When I started to watch, I noticed how it was similar in concept to Gotcha! (1985), with an American civilian mixed up in international intrigue. And as much as I still like Gotcha!, Condorman is the superior movie. Gotcha! is all nerdy hormones and awkwardness, while Condorman just rolls out fantastic comic book surprises one after the next.

For an actor whose career apparently peaked with this movie, Michael Crawford does a great job and is very likeable. James Hampton is a guy with not a ton of name recognition, but has a ton of face recognition, and is great in this movie. Barbara Carrera went on to be a Bond girl opposite Sean Connery 2 years later, and is very much a Bond girl here and Oliver Reed plays a menacing villain.

Even though The Cat From Outer Space (1978) has more than 6 actors with speaking lines, and a cast filled with recognizable stars from TV and Disney movies, Condorman is just as much fun.

The Region 2 Disney UK DVD comes with no special features. Audio options are English, French and German. With Subtitles options being English, French and German as well. The credits all come at the beginning of the movie, which was how credits were done until George Lucas changed the industry with Star Wars, so the lack of end credits seems a bit jarring. When I played this on my computer with the VLC player, there was black bars both below and on the side of the image. But in my multiregion Blu Ray player, the image wiled my widescreen TV.

Several UK sellers on Amazon are selling this for under $10 plus shipping and at that price, you can't go wrong with this DVD, if you have the ability to play other region DVDs."
3334,764005529,5,A childhood favorite movie
3335,764005529,4,classic family fun
3336,764005529,2,My fiance bought this for me for Christmas. I love this movie and we were both very disappointed that it does not  play here in the U.S. because of the coding.
3337,764005529,3,"Not very good, but it's an interesting look into what Michael Crawford was doing between ""Hello Dolly"" and ""Phantom of the Opera"""
3338,764005529,4,"I loved this movie as a kid. I got it to show my kids. They love it too. Now that I'm older, the cheesiness of the movie is apparent. Still great for kids, though!"
3339,764005529,5,one of our favorite Disney movies!
3340,764005529,4,One of my husband's favorite movies
3341,764005529,5,Wow. Just as I remember.
3342,764005529,5,"Great movie!  I think it is the best parody of superhero comic book movies.  I will not say anymore, just watch it!"
3343,764005529,5,I was very excited to find this on DVD; our grown kids LOVED getting it for Christmas! Thank-you!
3344,764005529,5,Good movie
3345,764005529,5,"Great James Bond Spoof, corny humor but I love it."
3346,764005529,5,Such a wonderful classic!
3347,764005529,5,I love this movie! No bad language. Humour. Suspense. Action. I wish more movies came out like this one. One of my all time favourites.
3348,764005529,3,For those wondering it is not as good as you remember. Era of boring kids movies from Disney.
3349,764005529,5,Great classic movie! I always wanted to fly like he does with the wings.
3350,764005529,5,"Great Disney movie.  This is not the best copy but good enough for us.  The movie is terrific of Disney, especially in the old days!"
3351,764005529,5,Oh classic movies that I can now watch from anywhere.  I didn't appreciate howhat hot Laserror Lady was as a child.
3352,764005529,5,Bought this for my husband and he loved it.
3353,764005529,3,saw as a child.  Still like it.
3354,764005529,3,Was pretty good for a dated movie.
3355,764005529,5,the movie is very funny
3356,764005529,5,I watched this movie as a kid and was thoroughly entertained. This makes a great family movie that is fun and involves the watchers all the way through.
3357,764005529,5,Very good!
3358,764005529,1,"Be advised, this is a pan-and-scan version of a widescreen (2.35:1) film.  Amazon does not disclose that this is significantly modified from full versions available through Disney.  It's fine when a widescreen film is not available in full HD, but it's shameful when a digital content leader like Amazon feels it's fair to offer a film in a modern format while cropping it to outdated 4:3 screen format.  Half the screen image is missing.  One would expect a refund, but be advised there are no refunds or returns for amazon instant video."
3359,764005529,5,Watched this movie as a kid and now my kids love it too!  A classic!
3360,764005529,4,We watched this with our younger children years ago and have had fun watching it again.
3361,764005529,5,"One of the best movies I watched as a kid, and watched it again with my four girls. Still a blast and an amazing clean movie."
3362,764005529,5,This is by far my favorite disney movie from my childhood. Wish they would remake this one.  Just watch it.
3363,764005529,4,I watched this as a kid. So glad that Disney is finally coming out with these old films. Thanks Disney.
3364,764005529,5,"A nice movie for the family to watch while getting the feel for James Bond storylines.  There's fancy gadgets, the pretty gal, disguises, explosions...and a bad guy who's just a bit scary."
3365,764005529,5,"It was fun and adventurous.  A little romance. We all enjoyed this comedy adventure movie.  Full of surprises, too. Yes."
3366,764005529,5,"I love this, it was packed well and exactly as pictured. i would recommend this product to anyone looking for something nice."
3367,764005529,5,I have watched this movie many times from childhood and love to watch it every time. it is creative funny and full of action.
3368,764005529,2,"Years ago I thought this was really enjoyable.  This time, as a grandmother, I saw less to like.  What should have been fun and intriguing ended with more violence than necessary and an inappropriate conclusion.  Silly old boy and worldly wise woman.  I'd forgotten."
3369,764005529,5,I only wish that I had bought the movie rather than rented it!  Great film of good vs. evil.  Love it!
3370,764005529,1,Movies have gotten so much better. I remember this being one of my favorites as a 9 year old. Always wondered why it was so hard to find. Finally bought it for my nine year old to watch together. We both thought it was pretty terrible. Now I know why Disney has tried to keep this one hidden.
3371,764005529,5,"This one is great!, if you haven't seen it, it is totally worth purchasing, My kids were cracking up when they were watching it!"
3372,764005529,1,I have no electronic device to watch this on.  I wanted a hard copy of this movie.  It was to be a gift.
3373,764005529,3,"Then I watched as an adult... I actually got Amazon prime for this particular movie even though its not on prime.  it was the reason to set up the tvs and all that.  i wanted to feel all warm and gooey about this movie but i just didn't, it just didn't hold up  at all. Plus i had to listen to my wife make ""Phantom"" jokes the whole night. still I am thankful i got to see it again.  If only for the ending.  Sometimes thats all you need. #nostalgia"
3374,764005529,5,My kids love this movie! They say condorman is their favorite super hero. We rented it first then had to buy it.
3375,764005529,5,Family appropriate and the right kind of clean humor that my children enjoy!  My husband has wanted me to watch this movie for years and thanks to Amazon Prime we were all able to watch it.  We all enjoyed Condorman!
3376,764005529,5,"I ordered this for my grands, ages 6 & 7 and they love it!  Thank you for creating the instant purchase.  It filled a ""snow day""."
3377,764005529,5,"A great old Disney flick!  Clean, entertaining, silly, and enjoyable.  It's nice to find a movie that doesn't use filth to entertain."
3378,764005529,5,"I watched Condorman with my family (kids were grade school age) while stationed in Japan with the Navy a long time ago. Loved it then and was so happy to see it come out in DVD. Such a wonderful, family oriented show. Full of laughs but done with values that are clearly defined without being pushy. Disney does a great job with that.

We watched the DVD a couple weeks ago during our Christmas holiday. This was the first time we watched since so long ago. My sons are in the corporate world now but we still had a fantastic time; laughing and joking throughout. It brought such warm memories. Amazing how all of us were able to anticipate the scenes throughout the movie; even some of the dialogue. I wish Disney had done a Condorman 2, but such is life."
3379,764005529,5,It was great! we enjoyed it almost as much as the first time. It's silly and funny. And better than any of the comic book remakes.
3380,764005529,4,This is a rather old movie but still fund to watch. Fun kids movie that will keep the parents watching.
3381,764005529,4,"I purchased ""Condorman"" for my husband as a Christmas gift. He'd seen it years ago and was thrilled there was a DVD version. We both enjoyed this family-friendly action hero.  It's a shame Disney doesn't make/promote this type of fun-hero movie any more."
3382,764005529,5,I looked many years for this movie... Watched it as a kid and had not seen it since until now... Love the 80's
3383,764005529,5,"Before he was The Phantom of the Opera, he was Woody (better known as Condorman) and before Barbara Carrera was Fatima Blush [007's Never Say Never (Again)], Barbara Carrera was Woody's love interest, Natalia--she was a looker back then. Condorman really did protect us from those Commies!"
3384,764005529,3,Curious Disney from the early 80s. Somewhat entertaining. Not as good as I remembered. Definitely a product of its era.
3385,764005529,4,"My dad watched this all the time when I was growing up. My husband wanted to show our children. Our oldest wants to own it now. It is a fun, cheesy film. Love it."
3386,764005529,5,"This movie is one of my childhood favorites! I saw it on the Disney Channel back in the Eighties (when the Disney Channel first came out). I used to have my parents rent the video tape for me. I went twenty years without seeing it. Now that I've seen it again its just as awesome as I remember! I'm delighted to be able to show it to my own young children. A good clean movie with lots of adventure, imagination, and humor!"
3387,764005529,5,"Best ""worst"" movie ever.  I am very happy to have it on something other than VHS.  It is a fun adventure."
3388,764005529,5,Good family movie. Kids were in the backseat laughing and it was funny to listen to while I was driving.
3389,764005529,5,"Condarman is one of Disney's more brilliant films in the last few decades. The story has the taste of Peter Sellers classic ""Pink Panther"" movies and that special ""80's"" movie magic that hollywood hasn't been able to replicant since.

Superhero films are big in Hollywood right now, though I doubt they'd make a reboot of this movie a part of me is glad they won't. This classic can hold it's own without the need for any blockbuster A-lister or CGI effects.

Buy it. Watch it. Love it. Thank me afterwards."
3390,764005529,5,"Haven't seen this movie since I was nine years old--it was my Dad's favorite movie back then, and thanks to Amazon, we were able to enjoy it together again! A fun family movie from Disney"
3391,764005529,1,"I thought I buying a copy and not paying a ten dollars for a playing of condor man.  It's a good movie but not that good.  Besides I have a
copy on vhs. Sorry I messed up.  I will give it one star because of the price."
3392,764005529,5,Still a great movie after all these years  - my kids loved it in the '70s and now my grandchildren love it.
3393,764005529,4,"My wife and I are real fans of this old movie and we were looking for it, including in our last trip to Disney World resort. It was very nice that Amazon put it  in its catalog. What else can I say, I liked the picture back in the past and it brings to me  nice memories."
3394,764005529,4,"I gave it four stars, what else is important? This whole idea that you MUST add words to a review makes me not want to bother."
3395,764005529,5,"This movie is corny and just fun. With improved technology of today, I would love to see a remake. A comic book comes to life."
3396,764005529,4,"I loved this as a kid and i still manage a few laughs now. It is a pretty cheesy movie but I guess I  like a bit of cheese.
I hear they are making a new movie of this and I am sure it will be action packed.
The story is ok, Michael Crawfords American accent is terrible but  I just keep coming back to watch it.
I did like the gagets and the disguises - funny."
3397,764005529,5,I have not been able to purchase this movie yet. I rented the movie to watch since I grew up with it. I absolutely love the movie and wish I could find it for a cheaper price. I hope it will be released on Blu-ray. Will rent again if still available sometime.
3398,764005529,5,"Hilarious old school Disney Movie.  One of Michael Crawford's funnier roles.  The special effects are not up to snuff, and the story line drags at places, but it is still a fun movie to watch with kids."
3399,764005529,4,This is a fantastic classic funny spy flick. Always been a favorite of my families. It's great to have a copy now.
3400,764005529,5,"I'm buying classic moves.  I remember this from long ago and since I liked it then, I bought it so others could watch it."
3401,764005529,4,I used to watch this as a kid and its still a good movie. These days you have to screen every movie before your kids watch it. This movie passes the test.
3402,764005529,4,"Lots of fun for our little boy who loves cars.  Races, crashes, explosions, boats with lasers--we thought it was very campy but funny."
3403,764005529,5,"8-1982 until 9-1983, we lived in Germany. My Dad worked for National Semiconductor, and they needed him in Germany. We had jack for American movies, so we learned to love the ones we had. Thanks to this purchase, I now have DVDs of what I call my Germany Classics: Tron, Grease 2, Stripes on one tape, Love At First Bite, Zorro The Gay Blade on another tape, and Dragonslayer, and Condorman.
My GF thinks it's cheesy and if I watch it around her, she always says loudly ""It's SOOO CHEEESY!!"" Like I care. She likes Secret Life of The American Teenager... yeeccch!"
3404,764005529,5,One of my favorite movies of my youth. It was one that the whole family enjoyed. A good movie to take me back.
3405,764005529,5,I watched this movie all the time as a kid and was very happy to see it available here. Still as great as I remembered it!
3406,764005529,5,"Surprisingly funny! The cover makes it look lame, but Disney did a good job with this one. It is deliberately tacky, but not over the top."
3407,764005529,4,"Not near up to par with a modern action film.
But it is a real movie- non digital- and it has great old footage of European countries.
I grew up watching this movie so I can't bash it."
3408,764005529,5,A found memory from my youth. Now if I could only get it in a digital format. A must see for an 80s super hero movie fan.
3409,764005529,1,This product does not work in the U.S. if your DVD player has a Region Code inhibitor installed. That's just about everybody. They should warn the buyer of this prior to purchase. Waste of time.
3410,764005529,5,I saw this in a movie theatre with my family when I was just 9 years old and have remembered it ever since. It have been trying to find it to show my husband and kids. This was a great option to do so. They loved it!!!!!
3411,764005529,1,"This was not a box office hit when it was first released; most critics hated it.  Time has not tempered its many flaws.  The humor is broad and at times overbearing, abrasive.  The lead character is a nitwit, obnoxiously stupid.  Oddly enough, this is the only character played for laughs, the rest are deadly serious in their intent (none more so than Oliver Reed as the villain, one of the few bright spots in an otherwise dreary enterprise).  The effect is quite jarring, as though they forgot to inform Michael Crawford that they had changed their minds, the piece was now a gritty spy thriller.  Unfortunately, it's never as funny as it should have been, and not serious enough to work on any other level.

This is not a movie I'd ever want to watch again under any circumstance."
3412,764005529,4,"James Bond comic book style by Disney. Brought to life from a comic book figure the writer entangles himself by falling in love with another agent from the other side that wishes to defect shortly after they meet in an simple document exchange. Upon her choice she will only defect if the pick up and transfer is done by Condorman!!! As this is the name the writer provided when they met. It is a cool adventure through the countryside with hang gliding, a gypsies truck that turns into a race car and then a hydrofoil with awesome care and boat chases through the Italian Mountains. So Kick back and Enjoy a great movie!!!!"
3413,764005529,5,My husband loves this film. It is one of his favorites and I might need to order another one because we lent it out and never got it back
3414,764005529,5,A movie from my childhood. I saw this all the time. Its alittle cheesy but still holds up as a great movie.
3415,764005529,5,Corny but a lot of fun.  Have been looking for this DVD for quite some time.  Big names in the cast that truly fit the different characters.
3416,764005529,5,"Having seen the movie years ago, I was pleasantly surprised to see it in DVD.  DVD was in excellent condition but movie itself could have been clearer but that may be due to the technology used at the time of filming."
3417,764005529,5,"i love this movie!  of course i want Morovich's car - it is the most tricked out of the Prognoviach's cars.  and the ingenuity with the caravan turning into a sports car is classic.  a wonderfully imaginative movie everyone should see - as a kid, and as an adult!"
3418,764005529,5,Great movie from my kid years love that they make it in dvd now would recommend the  movie for the old school people of my years
3419,764005529,5,We have been trying to find a copy of Condorman for a number of years. Thanks for making it available. It is in great shape and we've enjoyed it immensely.
3420,764005529,4,"While slightly cheesy, (where in the world does Condorman find such hideous clothes?) there is actually a decent story and the comedy is nonstop. Gotta love the Laser gun!"
3421,764005529,5,"This is the release of the movie Condorman, a movie by Disney that is so underappreciated.  There is a scene where the here uses a car to get away from bad guys. Well, lets just say, James Bond should lust after this car.  It is a fun movie all around, and considering the time it was made it, it is almost like a forerunner to the movie Red."
3422,764005529,4,"This is such a fun movie. We actually purchased it in the dvd format after having it in vhs when our children were younger. When our son got married this summer, he and his bride-to-be listed some dvds that they would like. Although not officially part of the list, he verbally mentioned Condorman, so we bought it. The problem is the audio is not of very good quality. I was disappointed, because that really did effect its entertainment value."
3423,764005529,5,Better than I remembered!  Very underrated film.  The car chase scene is second to none.  And shooting villians with lasers from speedboats...what's not to love?
3424,764005529,5,"This movie is as fun as I remembered.  How wonderful to bring back those memories of watching with my children, and now to share it with my grandchildren.  My kids were so excited to see that I had it - the laughter in my house was priceless."
3425,764005529,5,"I LOVE this movie!  I remember when it came out in theaters AND when it came out on the Disney Channel--back when the Disney Channel first began and wasn't full of formulaic tween chaos. My brother and I couldn't get enough of it. The effects are cheesy, but pretty cool for their time. It is clearly a ridiculous, unbelievable, unlikely premise, which makes it a fantastic adventure. What child/comicbook fan doesn't fantasize about being the superhero? What inner child (especially guys) don't wish for an inexhaustible bank account to create the weapons and toys that the superheroes without special powers get to use in their fight for truth and justice? That's what makes this film so much fun, even now almost 30 years later."
3426,764005529,5,"Grow up loving this movie and then  proceed to search for if over the years!!!!

Now I love watching it even more with my kids!!! GREAT MOVIE"
3427,764005529,5,"My son loved this movie when he was young.  I wanted to get it for him in DVD.  It was shipped promptly, arrived in good shape."
3428,764005529,3,"I rented the film for $1.99 because I found the sale price way too high.  It's a charming, funny, lighthearted spoof of the secret agent genre.  I'm a big Michael Crawford fan and this is the only work available where he's not lost in the character like Forum or Dolly. I wish he'd done more film work post-Phantom of the Opera. He has a true gift for comedy."
3429,764005529,3,"This movie is OK for $5, but not for $20. This movie does not have  the exceptional-Disney charm of excellent Disney-movies like, ""Swiss Family Robinson"", ""Summer Magic"", ""That Darn Cat old-version"", or good Disney movies like ""Toby Tyler"".

If you are rich or can find it for $5; it holds your attention, a little humor, but not exceptional humor, filmed on locations, some interesting gadgets but nothing you have not seen before, moves at a decent pace.

If you pay too much for this film; you will not enjoy it, because you are not buying that charm of a bygone era. This film is simply an OK film on a modern theme.

Some of the five-star-reviews are shil-reviews by sellers. I have paid a premium for other discontinued films, which were excellent, and which I did not regret paying extra to get. This is not one of them."
3430,764005529,5,"Wonderfully fun movie that brings me back to my childhood!
A little over priced for a DVD at $32.00, but it was the only place I could find it!
So I guess it was worth it!"
3431,764005529,4,This was my son's favorite video when he was young. So happy to have tracked it down. Priceless Michael Crawford before Phantom!
3432,764005529,5,"I was hesitant about purchasing a used DVD, but this DVD was very well done.  It was not filmed off of a TV or something like that, and the picture and sound quality were exactly as I had expected.  Shipping was quick and everything was the way it should be.  I would purchase from the seller again."
3433,764005529,5,"great, clean 4 the whole family. any adult that liked the old pink panther movies will like this as well."
3434,764005529,4,"I have been searching for this movie on dvd for over 10 yrs , as a lota people have. And finally I found this version , which was until recently , very rare and hard to come by. This is a pretty good quality late 1999 - 2001 dvd. Yes , I know what the title says , but that's not entirely correct. This tranfer is not super great , but it is good. Honestly , It still can be very Dusky and even a little old world blurry at times with the pops and grain clearly visible. There is no behind the scenes footage at all simply a Laser-disc like menu and the movie. Don't let that statemnet fool you , this definitly is a quality transfer for the times and not a laserdisc bootleg by any stretch. But Hopefully one day This movie will get the remastered High-def treatment it so desperatly deserves. But for old school fans like myself right now , it's just a treat to have this on dvd disc to enjoy the fun , and I think you will too."
3435,764005529,5,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE I SAW IT FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING MY CHILDHOOD ON VHS IN THE 80'S
GREAT FAMILY FUN AS USUAL IN DISNEY MOVIES I RECOMEND IT."
3436,764005529,5,"I have been searching for this for approx 10 years...and finally found it.  DVD quality was clearly not restored, but good quality either way.  I'm satisfied with this movie."
3437,764005529,5,"I would rather buy it for [...] then to spend over [....] on other Disney movies I already own or don't want.  Plus I've been -HAD- with Disney's so call ""Movie Club"" and will not attempt to rejoin with them again.

A Big THANK YOU to the sellers who will sell the Disney Exclusive Products on Amazon.  Makes my shopping a whole lot less complicated.  I just have to buy one thing...that's it!  No clubs to join and no contracts...."
3438,764005529,1,My other review was deleted but beware this disney dvd of condorman is not out of print and is way cheaper on the disney club i cannot write down the prices because that is why my review was probrably deleted because the sellers don't want people to know they can get this dvd cheaper.the anchor bay versions are out of print but not these ones.....you have been warned.i am going to write to disney to let them know about this and hopefully amazon can list the proper prices for everyone to buy.and not be ripped off in times of hardship otherwise great movie 5 stars for this.
3439,764005529,5,"Out of print, hard to find DVD. Expensive for just a single disc movie, but very fair price considering I've seen it for much more than what I paid. The DVD arrived in a condition matching that of the description, and when contacted, the seller communicated promptly and with great courtesy. I definitely would do business with them again. Thanks!"
3440,764005529,4,"CONDORMAN was a childhood favorite of mine, and, brother, I have been waiting impatiently for a Region 1 DVD to get my mitts on. So it's about time (but now I'm cheesed with the DVD's lack of special features). I find it really hard to be objective with CONDORMAN, this film being such a cherished memory. Having seen it again very recently, I can't help but note the datedness, the laughably rendered laser beam effects, and that hokey theme song and the cheesy cartoon Condorman in the opening credits. But mostly I happen to think that the film does stand the test of time, in terms of its watchability, its humor, and its sense of wonder and adventure.

Some SPOILERS now, peppered throughout.

A conscientious comic book artist, Woody Wilkins won't put anything in his comics which his characters couldn't do in real life. As such, the movie opens in Paris with Woody gigged out in full Condorman regalia and leaping off the Eiffel Tower to test his Condorman wings. It sucks for him that the wings malfunction and he ends up diving into the Seine river. So right away you get a sense of what this cat is like: an adventurous dreamer.

Woody thinks that his friend Harry's job in the CIA is fraught with excitement and skullduggery, even as Harry insists that he's merely a file clerk. But when Harry is tasked with finding a civilian to handle a simple courier assignment in Istanbul, he taps Woody for the mission. In Istanbul Woody meets the mysterious Natalia and impresses her when, in a pretty hilarious scene, he inadvertently takes out several enemy agents.

Cut to some time later, and we finally get to the central plot. The CIA learns that a Soviet KGB operative codenamed the Bear wants to defect, but that the Bear wants only the agent known as Condorman to act as the primary facilitator. Woody is initially reluctant, but caves when he learns that the Bear is actually Natalia (who's mistaken Woody for a top agent) and that the CIA has agreed to bring his comic book designs to life. The rest of the film treats us to more globetrotting exploits, zany secret agent and superhero antics, and a whiff of romance.

So, if you're a kid at heart, CONDORMAN should be right up your alley. One of its strongest points is that it does a good job of massaging your sense of wish fulfillment. Because who hasn't daydreamed of accomplishing daring deeds, of coming out the hero and winning that girl? CONDORMAN is awesomely nerdtacular.

Michael Crawford, if you remember him at all, is more famous for stuff like HELLO, DOLLY and for playing the Phantom of the Opera on stage (for which, to give him his just due, he garnered massive props). Crawford is skinny, gangly, boasts a non-heroic voice, and isn't who you first think of when drawing up the prototypical intrepid man of action. But he's good as the comic book creator/nerd with aspirations of derring-do. This is a Disney flick, so, it's certainly wholesome enough and its sensibilities lean toward the youngsters. A  film like this can get away with a character like Woody Wilkins, a ""foolish dreamer who draws comic books"" who then takes on the identity of one of his creations.

It helps that Condorman has a supporting cast who mostly plays it straight, notably Oliver Reed as the sinister Russian masterspy Krakov, Barbara Carrera as the exotic femme fatale Natalia, and James Hampton who plays Woody's amiable pal and CIA contact Harry Oslo. Jean-Pierre Kalfon, the sorta scary one-eyed Russian hitman Morovich, does it over-the-top, but, really, what else can you do when you're sporting a menacing glass eye and tearing down the Yugoslavian roads in an intimidating black Porsche? And, man, watching this film again just brings back those good old days, when the Iron Curtain was still up and the U.S. and the USSR were still kicking it Cold War. The prevailing thought back then was that the Russian Bear would be a superpower forever...

CONDORMAN is loosely based on Robert Sheckley's novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Game-of-X/dp/0441273084/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Game of X</a>, which I haven't read but have just now ordered online because I hear good things about it. Catering to Woody's intent that Condorman be an international crime fighter, his plan to help Natalia defect involves their navigating a circuitous route, from Yugoslavia to the Swiss Alps to a final showdown in Monte Carlo. Considering that they end up running a gauntlet of enemy operatives in all their stops, they might as well have taken a direct flight home. But where's the fun in that, right? I thought it a perfect touch that Krakov is able to anticipate Condorman and Natalia's itinerary simply by reading Woody's comic books.

When I saw this as a kid, I was totally enthralled by the James Bond-type gadgetry. Even now, I still get a kick out of watching the sluggish Gypsy conveyance transform into the sleek Condormobile and then into a hovercraft. The laser guns, however, sucketh big. Note that CONDORMAN is more a lighthearted spy thriller than a superhero caper. Woody as Condorman appears briefly in the opening sequence and then in the last act. And, as Condorman, he doesn't really indulge in hands on fighty fights but instead settles for foiling the bad guys from a distance, soaring on wings from above and then firing off missiles at them from his Condorboat. I dug the costume, though, and as an L.A. Dodger fan, I'm glad the film closes out in Dodgers stadium, even as Woody receives his next cloak & dagger assignment. I wish, though, that we'd seen something of Woody's other creations. I can't help being intrigued by the likes of Gopher Boy, Bazooka Boy, and Laser Girl. Where oh where can I get me some of those fun Zowie Comics?"
3441,764005529,4,It is a great movie. I really enjoyed it. It has some humorous parts too. I think it is a movie everyone could enjoy.
3442,764005529,4,"I remember watching an interview a few years back like ""This is your life"" with Michael Crawford, and they went through his career of TV, movies and plays etc.. and I kept waiting for them to mention Condorman, but they never did :( and they should, as it's a very underrated movie.

When I was a kid, this was one of my favorite movies. About Woody (Crawford) who is a comic book writer who's best friend Harry (Michael J Fox's father in Teen Wolf/Longest Yard (original) guy who dies) is a file clerk for a spy company, who when left in charge to send a civilian to Istanbul to deliver some spy papers, he bumbled his way into making a top KGB agent (Natalia) believe he is a top agent and she later wishes to have him help her defect to America.

Woody takes on the challenge and finds himself being chased by Natalia's boss/lover or whatever and his team of henchmen while Woody pulls out all his toys and gadgets to help aid their escape, in the fashion of Woody bringing his comic book super hero character to life.

Seeing this again many years later, I can see why it is more of a cult classic then a very popular action/adventure comedy. But, it is still a lot better then most of the **** that floods the shelves these days, and this one is very underrated as a b grade comedy.

The character of Woody reminds me of Maxwell Smart, a bumbling secret agent who doesn't always escape by skill or outsmarting the bad guys, but by unintentional luck, but gets the girl in the end. Just try to imagine Maxwell Smart wants to be Batman at the same time, and that is about what Condorman is.

A lot of humor, zany antics, car chases and star wars lasers.. all blended in for a fun ride.

Ignore anyone selling this second hand on amazon or anywhere else for over 20 bucks... they are ripping you off hard. The DVD quality is not that great, it kind of looks like it was done straight from an old VHS to DVD without bothering to clean it up. And there is no bonus features. This DVD deserves more respect then this, and I hope Disney decide to do a special edition of it someday.

Oh yeah, not to forget, the second hand sellers are selling the out of print region 1 version... the DVD is still in print in region 4 for about 10 bucks, and includes another film with it too. And don't worry about the region stuff, they play in any old computers DVD player. So I'd recommend doing the smart thing and finding the ones still in print and pay a whole heap less then these clowns prices.

and to the person who is selling it for 500 bucks, BWUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH, you have a b grade movie there, not the holey grail."
3443,764005529,5,"I am a little ashamed that my first review on Amazon wasn't this movie, instead I reviewed King Kong (new remake) - SHAME ON ME!!! This movie is fantastic! I remember watching it as a very young child and was mezmerized by it! It has a story, a creative concept, and a steller cast. The idea at the time was exciting because it was around the time of The Greatest American Hero and has some of the same kind of humor in it.

RE-RELEASE THIS DISNEY! I'm begging! I want to see if it holds up over time!!!"
3444,764005529,4,"This is one of those movies that would have been a massive hit if it had had a star in it. However it is still a great movie with fantastic action set pieces and pretty good jokes. If you want to ask Disney to let you know when it's re-released use the link on the Disney DVD website and then follow instructions to be 'emailed when it is available'. (Can't post the link here on Amazon as it's a no no to include web addresses so do a search for Condorman on the Disney DVD site).

(...)"
3445,764005529,5,"i love this movie, my second fav old video.

fast car chases, cool car gadgets, and a good sense

of humor. tops james bond any day...."
3446,764005529,4,"I was in middle school when this movie came out. It was 1981 and I had saved up my pocket money to pay for the bus ride into the city and the admission for a matinee to a movie that seemed so exciting and lively to me.

I had read the book 'The Game of X' by Robert Sheckley as well as the adaptation of the movie by Heather Simon and imagined every scene in my head as I had gone through it. The movie was everything a young boy could have hoped for - a rollicking, comedic adventure with a very beautiful female Russian agent (Carrera) and a sinister KGB chief (played by Oliver Reed).

The only problem I have with this movie is the miscasting of Michael Crawford as Woody Wilkins, the cartoonist who helps out a friend of his at the CIA office in Paris. Englishman Crawford puts on the most exaggerated American accent imagineable, although admittedly he has the brilliant comedic timing necessary to pull off this role.

The CIA in France has a problem. They need a civilian to act as a courier to Istanbul. Of course Woody gets the job, but right from the start it's obvious he is taking his role just a little too seriously. By the time he arrives to meet his KGB contact in Turkey he has fully assumed the role of his cartoon creation - top CIA agent and superhero Condorman.

Barbara Carrera (who two years later would get to play a Bond girl - the very movies this one attempts to lampoon) plays KGB agent Natalia. Later, when she makes the decision to defect, the impressive Condorman comes to mind as the only CIA agent she will trust to handle her defection.

The only problem is the CIA does not have an agent with the codename Condorman.

What follows is an adventure filled race across Europe with enough gadgets to fill several Bond movies. There is some great car chases (performed by legendary French stunt driver Remy Julienne and his 16-man crew of drivers and mechanics), boat chases and along the way Crawford sports some of the most outrageous disguises in cinema history. It's all great fun and it's executed perfectly.

For high flying escapist entertainment they don't come much more downright enjoyable than this. The DVD is a disappointment with no special features to speak off except a rather slim production notes section in the inside cover booklet. It's 2 pages of notes on the making of the movie, with sections on 'The Story,' 'The Setting,' 'Gadgetry' and 'Stunts and Special Effects,' but it's all very slim pickings.

But, I've had this movie in my DVD collection for over two years and on those quiet rainy Saturday's it's a particular favorite (along with 1980s FLASH GORDON) to put in my DVD player and sit back and remember a more innocent time in my life.

Recommended for all dreamers."

i hope that you have it to send me, thanks."
3448,764005529,5,"It was 1981... I was a poor, young man lost in a cloud of bong smoke, living in some cardboard box on the corner of 1st and Main.  I was living a lie.  A horrible lie, like that time I told mom that binky the bunny ran away... and then served the family ""lamb"".  Anyway, all I had were comics, graphic novels, if you know what I mean... and my favorite character?  The Thing from the fantastic four.  Why?  He was encased in a shell of stone... just like me.  So there I am in my box... and I happen to find $3.25 in canadian pennies one day.  Instead of buying a premium bottle of the happy juice, I saw the marquee and it sang CONDORMAN.  I was on the edge of my seat with the opening credits.  This man... was me.  A dreamer who had shed the skin of ambiguity and embraced the true nature of the... ummm... dream.  I had no wings.  Condorman gave me wings.  I love you, Condorman.  Whenever you're in my part of town, be sure to stop by... mine's the box where the rabid coyote prince sings his tortured songs of yesteryear.  Bring that lady, too... man... I mean... umm... man.  And eat meat."
3449,764005529,1,"I love this movie, and have been waiting for it to be released on dvd. Unfortunately, the dvd was not worth the wait. The dvd has no features whatsoever, not even subtitles. The main menu has two options, play movie and chapter selections. The sound and picture are no better than the video; the only benefits the dvd has over the video are that you can fast forward directly to a specific scene, and you have your choice of full screen and wide screen (double sided dvd). What's the point of making a dvd if it is as bad as this one? Very disappointing....
P.S.  This is for the 1999 dvd version.  I noticed that a new version was released in 2003.  Hopefully that version is better."
3450,764005529,3,"Yes, it's Condorman, vulture of the western world and superhero/spy extraordinare!  Disguised as mild-mannered comic book writer/illustrator Woody Wilkins (Michael Crawford) by day, Condorman must fight a never ending battle to save the world from the ever growing forces of evil that threaten to engulf it, while at the same time trying desperately to protect his beautiful Russian spy girlfriend Natalia (Barbara Carrera) from the clutches of the villainous Krokov (Oliver Reed)!
Highlighted by a well above average cast and an exciting musical score composed by the one-and-only Henry Mancini, and loaded with tons of adventure, action and excitement...""Condorman"" is certainly a very fun movie to watch and is one that can be enjoyed by anyone, no matter how young or old they may be!"
3451,764005529,5,This is defintly a movie that the whole family will enjoy. Michael Crawford is just wonderful in it. I highly recommend this film. I'd give it ten stars if I could.
3452,764005529,1,"Grade-Z spy spoof starring the insufferable Michael Crawford, who would fortunatly redeem himself as the Phantom. The movie plays like one of those bad low-budget afternoon adventure shows on the USA Network. And the  special effects are dreadful. Sure, the movie is targeted toward children,  but even they will notice that the wires are easily visible when Condorman  flies. This isn't uncommon in special effects movies (even the most  expensive productions have their faults), but in this case the wires are so  visible and distracting (they almost look like ropes) it ruins the entire  fantasy element. I'm surprised Disney even greenlighted this project.  Pathetic."
3453,764005529,4,"As a kid, this was my favorite movie for quite some time.  I never thought I'd see them re-release it (as Disney would probably like to forget it ever existed) but I'm pleased none the less. Condorman is sort of a cross  between James Bond and Batman with some Pink Panther ineptitude thrown in  for laughs.  While it is not by any means a masterpiece, it's still pretty  fun and quite worthwhile.  It's got lots of high tech spy gear, including  cool cars, speedboats, lazers and other gadgets, humor, romance, an evil  villain, and a likable hero who comes out on top.  I've read some pretty  bad reviews of the film, complaining that there's no plot to it.  I don't  know what movie they were watching, but the film makes pretty good sense to  someone willing to just listen to the dialogue.  It makes a great deal more  sense than the plots of some other spy movies I could mention... Maybe  Condorman IS mostly for the kids, but if you have an attention span and  give it a chance, Ithink you'll find it's not nearly as bad as you may  have heard."
3454,764005529,5,"As a spoof of the spy genre, this is great.  Michael Crawford plays the lead with endearing charm and innocence, and, knowing his sense of humor, tongue-in-cheek.  Somehow it all works to be hilariously funny!"
3455,764005529,1,"This is a terrible film -- low-budget seat-of-the-pants filmmaking with an exceedingly thin plot line. But in a way, it's still worthwhile viewing for  fans of the sublime Oliver Reed, who makes a wonderfully sinister villain  (Russian this time); and Michael Crawford, who is his usual endearing self.  The latter's performance in ""Condorman"" is reminiscent of his  role as Cornelius Hackel in ""Hello Dolly,"" which is to say it's  about as far away from the Phantom as you can get. Still, the film is  amusing at times. But check out ""The Assassination Bureau"" if  you're an  Oliver devotee."
3456,764005529,5,In the history of film making this the best of all time. I thought Starship Troopers was the best of all time until I saw this again. I haven't seen this film in 15 years. It's a must see.
3457,764006401,5,"I am now reading Charles Dicken's Great Expectations for school, and watched this video as supplementary information. The video is very true to the book, for instance, lines directly from Dicken's text are used throughout the movie, and it's all very well put together. Overall it's a great movie too..."
3458,764006401,4,"Taking Charles Dickens' 521 page novel and turning it into a film is no easy matter, but this version seems to do a good job, following the life of Pip, the poor-turned-rich-turned-poor again young man who wants to become a gentleman.  Although this version doesn't offer many radical elements from the director, it does show chaos and darkness in the seeking of fortunes and offers a look into the neurotic behaviors lurking in our lives.  These expectations may not be great, but they certainly are worth watching."
3459,764006401,4,"I enjoyed this movie very much.  After just finishing the novel I bought  this movie.  I was really happy to see how close they stayed to the actual  book.  Most other movies take advantage of it.  This is a must! The camera  work done in the film is also really great.  I especially loved the way  that they ended it.  Ioan is fabulous and Charlotte shines as  Miss. Havisham.  Orlick was amazing!!  In fact everything about this movie  was!
A VERY VERY MUST!!!"
3460,764006401,4,"I originally only watched this movie because Ioan Gruffudd, my favorite actor is in it.  I saw him in Horatio Hornblower (which I reccomend you see also) and he was breathtaking.  So I figured that Great Expectations would  be just as wonderful.  It was very good, but not as interesting as HH.  Ioan, again, played his part with an enormous amount of emotion.  But I can  see why Horatio Hornblower won and the Emmy and not Great Expectations.  Don't get me wrong, it certainly held my interest, I watched it both nights  on PBS that it was on.  But it was slightly strange.  I can't see why it  ended the way it did.  (You'll have to see it to understand what I'm  talking about!)  But I did enjoy it, and reccomend it to anyone who likes  Charles Dickons and period pieces."
3461,764006401,5,"The entire production of ""Great Expectations"" is superb, with an outstanding cast, but the heart and soul of this movie is the actor, Ioan Gruffudd. He is heartbreakingly wonderful as this essentially good but  misguided young man.  I think his acting is some of the best I have ever  seen, particularly the prison scene with Joe, as well as his desperate  pleading to Estella as she leaves to wed another.  This is a beautifully  done work of art."
3462,764006401,4,"This stripped down version might not please the purists, but it's compelling and gripping nonetheless.  Beautifully acted by a stellar cast.  Ioan Gruffudd shines as Pip.  Pip undergoes profound change throughout the  story, and there's not a false moment in Gruffudd's performance.  Ian  McDiarmid as Pip's creepy guardian Mr. Jaggers and Charlotte Rampling as  the creepy Miss Havisham also excel.  Another superb BBC production."
3463,764006401,5,Dickens has rarely been adapted better. The final scenes of Pip reconciled to his fate reciting Greek to the dying Magwitch is pure cinematic poetry. Beautifully acted and shot this is a must see. Forget frumpy Jane Austen  costume dramas. This is a timeless piece of work. See it.
3464,764006401,5,"For some reason it seems fashionable to criticize this production, mainly because it carries old footage from Masterpiece Theatre, hosted by Russell Baker.  Further, this film was sponsored by Mobil Oil Co. and produced by the BBC.  In addition, some reviewers may see it competing with the classic starring John Mills and Alec Guinness from 1947.  Moreover, since this 1999 film was made, weve had the 2011 production starring Gillian Anderson and other versions, as well.  But viewers who fail to see this 3-hour epic from 1999 are really missing the best rendition of what may be Charles Dickens best novel.  The story is timeless and inspiring; the romance, touching and well-portrayed.  TV simply cant be better than this.

Casting is almost perfect with a young Ioan Gruffudd playing the grown up Pip and Gabriel Thomson the young Pip.  They look so much alike youd swear they're related in real life.  Beyond this, Charlotte Rampling seems an ideal choice for the quirky Miss Havisham, as does Justine Waddell playing the wounded Estella.  Other cast members, like those playing Magwich, Jaggers, Herbert Pocket, Joe, Wemmick, Molly, et al are equally well-chosen.

The ending of this story is not really a happy one.  Abel Magwich meets a grisly end, Miss Havisham is burned alive, and the romance between Pip and Estella seems to be in limbo.  One has to be reminded that Charles Dickens wrote the story and did two versions of the ending.  This is the happier of the two.

I don't know what other reviewers are talking about when they find fault with how dark and grim this production seems.  Im sure its exactly what Dickens would have wanted and exactly right for 1999.  No, I wouldnt object if the video were re-mastered into true HD-widescreen but I felt Id waited long enough to see this flim again.  No sign of a re-generation was found from BBC so I purchased it at a decent price on the secondary market.  If and when a re-mastered version of this classic appears I will want to buy it.

Summing up, those who haven't seen this version of Great Expectations shouldnt wait any longer.  Go and buy a copy from one of the Amazon re-sellers like I did.  This is the best version you will find and its production values are fine for now.  When a re-mastered version is released, Ill buy it."
3465,764006401,5,"I love this novel and I know all its versions, even the ultra-rare Classics
comic, and this is by far the best adaptation. First of all, it's the closest
to the book, character by character, and it's also beautifully directed and
acted. It's true Personenregie: you really feel the relationships among the
people--the protagonist and his brother-in-law, his sister, Estella, Herbert
Pocket (here, Daniel Evans, looking really cute in the role Alec Guiness played
for David Lean in the famous film), Miss Havisham, and of course Abel Magwitch,
the convict who sets the story in motion. Dickens lovers: seek no more. This is
the one."
3466,764006401,4,"My mother came to visit me recently and she wanted to know what movie I had for her to watch. I showed her and my aunt this movie and they were completely captivated. It is a good story especially if you are a romantic. However I was not so keen on the ending. It seemed like there should have been something more. Something more dramatic. Also at some points in the movie things got a little slow and it took patience to get past the scenes. I did think Charlotte Rampling was a perfect Miss Havisham and Justine Waddell was perfect as Estella. Ioan Gruffudd also expressed his emotions very well in each scene without being overly dramatic. This film portrays jealousy and love very well. It is a classic after all.

3467,764006401,5,"The movie arrived earlier then I thought and the discs were in great condition. I would also reconmend this version of the story, it's pretty close to the book."
3468,764006401,2,I was unable to pay this video on my TV because of the Region 2 code.  I could only watch it on my computer.
3469,764006401,2,"Great Expectations, 1999 film

A young man runs through reeds into a cemetery. When he returns home his sister scolds him for his absence. A man catches him alone and asks for a file and food. He is an escaped convict! Back at home he is told to be ""grateful"". Soldiers arrive for the blacksmith, they found the escaped convict and put him in irons. Joe never learned to read. [No schools for common people then.] Pip is cleaned up for a visit. He plays cards with a young girl (pretty and proud). [Does their behavior seem odd?] Pip is questioned about his visit. ""Can this be true?"" He returns in six days for another visit. He sees strange things in that house. When he returns he is given a large sum of money. Afterwards he gets into a fight. [What a strange household!] Pip dreams of a better life. There is conflict in the shop. Later Pip finds a body! Who did it?

Later Lawyer Jaggers tells Pip he has a fortune and will be brought up as a gentleman ""with great expectations"". It's a secret benefactor. Can Joe be compensated for the loss of Pip? Pip gets a new suit and goes to London. They show scenes of life in those days. [To shock the viewer?] Pip's education begins. He lodges at Bernard's Inn. He visits a coworker. He visits Jagger's home and is given a letter. He learns of the death of his sister. Pip visits Miss Haversham again. Pip meets a young lady, they go to a recital. There is a dinner, a toast creates conflict. Pip is jealous of Estella's beau. Pip is in debt, he gets 500 as a birthday present! A strange man meets Pip to tell him a secret. What will Pip do now? Pip visits Miss Haversham, there is a conversation and conflict. Then he visits Joe Gadgery. Miss Betty taught Joe to read. ""Never leave documentary evidence laying around."" Pip advises Abel to leave. Drummel married Estella. Jagger's housekeeper Molly has a past.

Pip returns to question Miss Haversham about Estella. He reproaches her for her past actions. There is a fire! Pip finds Auric and there is conflict. Pip tells his secret! [Who is worse off?] pip goes to the funeral. Abel talks about his lost daughter, given up for adoption. A side-wheel steamer is on the river. Another boat draws near. There is an accusation and a struggle! Two men fall into the water. Pip dives in to save a man. Abel is taken to court for trial. Pip and Wimmick visit a church. Later visits Abel on his deathbed to say goodbye. Abel's daughter is a lady now, but he never met her. Pip arrested for unpaid debts. Joe pays off the debts. Pip talks to Betty and learns surprising news. Pip returns to Miss Haversham's mansion and finds Estella living there. Is she unhappy? What will Pip do now?

I never read the book so I can't say how faithful this adaption was. The beginning dragged for nearly an hour. Maybe another writer or director would have done better? There were a lot of close-up shots as you would expect from a movie made for television. Charles Dickens's story tells how riches can make an average man into a gentleman, and no one seems to care as to the origin of these riches. Could someone who becomes wealthy through illegal or unethical means become a respected gentleman? Yes, it has happened many times. There once was a book that told about the History of the Great American Fortunes. There may be comparable books today, if they could be published."
3470,764006401,5,"Thank you, need to leave more words, well this is an adaptation from Dickens book, if your an Ioan Gruffudd fan it is not his best role, as it is rather limited.  But the production quality is lovely"
3471,764006401,5,"This was the first movie where I had noticed Ioan Gruffudd. Once you see him you will never forget. I like this interpretations of Charles Dickens. One of the most beloved BBC TV film like Pride and Prejudice, The Aristocrats, Tom Jones."
3472,764006401,5,"I have loved this version ever since it was aired on PBS' Masterpiece Theatre. The production values are very high here, as the sets, costuming, and cinematography are top-notch. The acting is first-rate here as well. In my humble opinion, Charlotte Rampling IS MIss Havisham. She embodies the complicated, subtle malice of a woman gone mad and Hell-bent on wreaking slow vengeance on the world, and the male sex in particular. And while this doesn't have a ""happy ending"", per se, Dickens' felt it appropriate to leave us with an ambiguous ending (albeit after changing the original ending), and I think it suits the film after the rest of it is very dark and sad. It would have seemed foolish for a happy ending to pop up out of nowhere. This version comes HIGHLY recommended! Now let's hope that a Blu-ray version is in the future to address the picture quality of the DVD!"
3473,764006401,4,"I wish someone would change the pic - it is misleading, and I hesitated to buy or not to buy the movie... In the end I'm glad I did, this movie is probably the closest version to the book. As expected with any BBC production, excellent performances, nice costumes, and a great re-creation of the book's atmosphere."
3474,764006401,5,"One of the cruelest stories I know. Dickens is so cruel we cannot imagine he is a man, what's more a humane human being.

A poor orphan, Pip, is raised by a poor blacksmith. A life of rough and tough luck. Take it or leave it, but there is no way out, except the radical one. And he dreams of being a gentleman one day. An aberration of course, morally wrong and bad taste.

He is selected and invited by Miss Havisham, a deranged rich woman who is mourning in total decay and sorrow after the failure of her wedding when the bridegroom did not come, twenty years before. Her objective is to provide a male companion and eventually husband to her adopted daughter, Estella.

But one night on the moor Pip is ""accosted"" by an prison escapee of some kind who asks for food and the boy of six or seven, maybe eight provides in the night, including a file for him to get rid of his manacles. He will turn up as his benefactor.

Luck, luck and luck. But then systematically Dickens shatters every single opportunity and hope on the side of the boy, Pip, who ends up in prison for unpaid debts, on the side of his benefactor, Abel, who will die in prison holding Pip's hand after his final arrest, on the side of Miss Havisham who will achieve none of her plans, on the side of Estella who will marry the rich and noble young man, will be brutalized and will end up alone in Miss Havisham's house, on the side of Biddy who will marry Joe the Blacksmith when Pip finally realizes she had been his closest ever friend, and even on the side of Estella who will refuse to requite Pip's love, though she will accept to make him her platonic companion in Miss Havisham's.redecorated house.

That cruelty is so extreme that we just wonder if Dickens then is not going through a phase of complete social rejection, rejection of the upper classes, rejection of the lower classes, rejection of justice, rejection of any discourse about the possible improvement of individuals and society. Absolute resignation and pessimistic submission to a totally inhumane world that only has some small pockets of satisfaction, but never for yourself, always for some rare others. He did not even salvage the exiled criminal who became Pip's benefactor, as Victor Hugo did in Les Misrables, and makes him die a solitary, nearly solitary death in prison with the sole company of the young man he tried and failed to help, and unaware of his daughter's fate, which does not seem to be particularly brilliant anyway, since she is Estella, daughter of a female assassin and a male exiled criminal condemned to absolute reclusion for life.

I just wonder if here Dickens does not reach Zola's pessimism who considered that anyone born in a criminal circle could only be that and drag everyone around him down into that criminal circle. No salvation for those who are badly born. The belief in an elected people turned into a savage and wild social Darwinism: some have been elected to be crushed and powdered by life as slowly as possible for them to regret ever being born but absolutely unable to shorten the ordeal.

Sad and sad and sad.

3475,764006401,4,"I agree with the previous reviewer that the preview is stupid; it's actually the first 2 mins and credits of the film.  However, I have seen the full movie several times and I think this is an outstanding version of ""Great Expectations."" The final scene really packed an emotional wallop for me, unlike some of the other versions. Good cast, classy production."
3476,764006401,5,This is the best version of this Dickens classic.  It is hard to find and I was thrilled to get it.
3477,764006401,1,I was hoping for a preview that would give me a taste of what the movie entails...this preview does nothing.  Unless the entire movie is of a field.  A waste of time.
3478,764006401,5,"I am thrilled to have found this version of ""Great Expectations"".I am a big fan of Charles Dickens - and of Ioan Guffudd, and I found it at Amazon.com"
3479,764006401,5,"Great expectations is a fine novel and is easier to get into than some of Dicken's longer tomes. This adaption is a fine one, which makes me recall the other fine BBC adaption of Bleak House in 2008(?). Both adaptions avoid sentimentality and are complemented by fine low key background music. I was particularly taken by the beauty of the marsh scenes. My one reservation was that perhaps Rampling is too fine a woman to be playing Havisham. Pip was done excellently as was stella and I was very much taken with the characther playing Joe. A fine adaption - well done BBC!"
3480,764006401,3,"I know many people seem to love this WGBH, Masterpiece Theatre 1999 production of Charles Dickens' novel ""Great Expectations."" However, I did not greatly enjoy this adaptation as many people have.

My reasons:

- The picture quality is not much better than the 1981 version. Therefore, my eyes are just as content to watch the 1981 version, which develops the characters much better (even if it drags on at times.)

- This production does not develop Orick's character, or Estella's character early in the production. In fact, Mr. Pumblechook and other characters are also not as developed as I would have wished.

- Dickens' novel drags on in the middle. This production greatly contracts the plot in the central half of the novel. For example, Bentley Drummel and Matthew Pocket's characters are not developed very well in the middle part of this work. Matthew's father is nearly eliminated.

- This words spoken in this production have been updated from the 1981 adaptation and the novel. In fact, the 1974 adaptation is more accurate than this 1999 production as pertains to including famous quotes from the novel.

One positive of this adaptation is that the mood (the psychology) of this adaptation is better than the 1981 version or any other version I have seen. A second positive is that the acting is this production is just as good as the 1981 adaptation.

In summary:
I prefer the 1981 version best (even though I would only give it a 4 star). However, this production is better than the 1974 Michael York/Sarah Miles adaptation, which completely eliminates the character of Orlick.

For people who want a film to watch for pleasure (rather than to prepare for a major content examination), this adaptation may be the most interesting and best choice. Otherwise, I would recommend the much longer 1981 adaptation."
3481,764006401,3,"This latest version of Dickens' sprawling novel of love, jealousy, betrayal, and redemption is a faithful (or as much as possible, even in a 3-hr production) rendering.  It is well cast, with Ioan Gruffudd as the most handsome Pip on film, and Charlotte Rampling giving her usual regal performance as Miss Havisham.

Production design is good, with grim revisionist views of 18th century London typical of modern adaptations.  Photography is first rate.

What is unacceptable is that the DVD is, apparently, recorded straight off the PBS broadcast -- just as if you recorded it yourself -- complete with all the ads for Mobil, lugubrious intoductions by the pedantic host of Masterpiece Theatre, and PBS icons lingering for 30 seconds at a time throughout the film.  Distracting, annoying, and unacceptable.

Order the Region 2 disc from the BBC if you can play it.  One should not pay a high price for a DVD that one could record off the air, and is little more than an ad for Mobil and PBS."
3482,764006401,5,"Julian Jarrold's adaptation shines not because of its faithfulness to the plot of the novel, but because of its effective use of character and mood. Both Abel Magwitch and Miss Havisham appear as ominous figures, much more so than in any other attempt to put Dickens' classic novel to film. Ioan Gruffuld's Pip, likewise, is more frightened as a child, more vulnerable as an adult, than we have ever seen him before. Estella is crueler and more beautiful. The mood throughout, from Pip's strange encounter in the graveyard, to his peculiar encounter with Orlick, to his final encounter with Estella, is often more grim, never more comic than the Dickens. A cloud seems to hang over everything, even its brightest comic moments, offered up in the movie by Wemmick and Herbert.

Often, what works well in a novel does not work well on screen. Jarrold understands this, and presents Dickens' characters as real human beings, establishes a setting that complements mood, and creates a version of 'Great Expectations' that is, in my opinion, one of the best every made."
3483,764006401,3,"I bought this DVD to see a very true interpretation of my favorite Dickens' novel. The movie itself is special and makes the wonderful mood. But this DVD contains the advertising - the big emblem which appeares every 15 minutes in the right bottom corner of your screen. It overlaps the picture and what is worse - you can't dip into the motion. It appeares twelve times all throughout the movie and is always very disturbing. I felt that I spent my money not well, because of this stupid interupting advertising. I was disappointed. But in the rest of things it is a wonderful movie."
3484,764006401,1,"The 1947-version is the best version, with John Mills, father of Haley Mills. I give the 1947-version 4-stars. The 1947-version is good.

In this 2004-version; actress, Justine Waddell, who was great as the sweet and wonderful Molly in ""Wives and Daughters"", co-stars. Here she plays an attractive woman, who has been raised by her jilted, grandmother to intentionally misuse and abuse men, who are infatuated with her beauty. She plays this part effectively as you feel the young man's emptiness in the end. However, I could not get into this version

The 1981-version has a better first episode; but then drags.

The book's author, Charles Dickens, married his wife Catherine in 1836. They were together 21-years, and had ten children. During his marriage Dickens wrote his brilliant novels: ""Oliver Twist"" 1839, ""A Christmas Carol"" 1843, and ""David Copperfield"" 1850. Mr. Dickens divorced his wife in 1858. Mr. Dickens wrote the story ""Great Expectations"" after his divorce in 1861. Divorce affects everyone no matter the circumstances. The 1947-version of ""Great Expectations"" is a good movie, but I did not like the part about the jilted, bitter, wealthy, old, grandmother; living in the dark, big house; with the dining-room and food left untouched for 50-years. Yet, if you persist through these strange scenes; the 1947-version is interesting later on in the film. I realize this woman is a necessary part of the story, but the film should have been much briefer with her.

Charles Dickens's book ""Oliver Twist"" is wordy, long, and daunting, unless you are a strong and imaginative reader. The ""Oliver Twist"" DVD is great for the rest of us, because the story has been so polished and streamlined by so many people. Before TV and movies; before radio, every town had a theatre that performed plays. Every town in England and America performed the play ""Oliver Twist""; for 90-years, until sound movies. For 90-years; these towns kept polishing the story and improving upon each other. Today; on DVD, the polished story skips along without a bump. The story ""Great Expectations"" did not get this polishing in the theatre and has a few bumps. Yet, even with the bumps; the 1947-version is a good story."
3485,764006401,2,"Even though I have never read the book I found this Production very good.

I would recommend this to any one who is a Dickens Fan but do youself a favour and don't buy this DVD release.

As a British review on Amazon uk site indicated this DVD looks as if it was copied straight off the TV and also the commentary in the beginning and end of the movie telling us about the Great Expectations novel made the DVD worse.

Masterpiece Theatre has spoiled this Great BBC Production of Dickens Great Expectations with it's Commentary (even though they think they are being helpful- but are not) and poor DVD.

Four Stars for the Production itself but giving this Two stars because of the DVD quaility.

Wait until BBC Release a DVD of the Production and the DVD quaility will be much, much better.

I will be selling this DVD and wait until BBC release the DVD in Australia."
3486,764006401,2,The video quality of this fine adaptation is terrible. I've been waiting years for a DVD release only to be dissapointed by the poor video transfer to DVD.
3487,764006401,5,"Charles Dickens triumphs once more. This excellent film adaptation of the masterpiece novel manages to be somewhat dark, gritty, and mysterious, and still maintain quirky memorable characters and a tangled web of plots in the typical Dickens way. Justine Waddell's performance as the icy Estella (a very different role from her warm character in ""Wives and Daughters"") is perfect, complimented by Ioan Gruffud's dramatic display as the hero of story, Pip. The movie is fairly true to the book, and likewise manages to be ambiguous, but satisfying. Fans of Dickens work will not want to miss this instant classic, and anyone looking for a good drama with mystery and character study will not be disappointed."
3488,764006401,4,This movie follows the book pretty well.  My 8th grade students enjoyed it.  We watched the movie before we read the book since sometimes the book can be hard to follow with the English flavoring in the language and the many  characters.  I would reccommend this movie.
3489,764006401,4,"This is a well done version and follows the book with just a few minor changes.  Ioan Gruffudd and Justine Waddell certainly make an attractive Pip and Estella.  Charlotte Rampling as Miss Havisham is younger, more beautiful and a bit more sane than she is usually portrayed but the part is well acted.  The actors playing Joe Gargory, Magwich, Remmick, Orlick and Jaggers are all well suited to their parts and do admirable jobs.  The movie has quite a dark and sinister mood and a lot of the characters that provide comic relief in the book including Pumblechook, Wopsle, the Pocket family, and Clara's father are eliminated or have the humorous aspect's of their characters trimmed leaving us nothing to laugh at.  A brooding musical score and lots of scenes of the desolate marshlands, dirty London and the decay of Miss Havisham's house also contribute to the somber mood."
3490,764006401,4,"There is a definitive modern flavor to this classic by Dickens, yet the handling of the story is very dignified and seems to translate to film almost perfect. Mobile Masterpiece Theatre's telling of Great Expectations accounts for many of the most important parts of the story, and those who have never read the book (or, those who chose not to read it in high school), will have an easy time understanding the story of Pip's rise and fall in both love and status. Certainly this is not some cheesy modern remake that tries to be hip and cool; instead it modernizes the tale in a way that is very ""Dickenseque.""

One of the greatest strengths of the film is characterization. Some may see Estella and Miss Havisham as being a little more ""sensitive and kind"" in this version compared to the novel, but overall they fit their roles well. Ioan Gruffudd does a superb job of Pip as an adult, who learns of his great expectations and tries to use these to gain a better status in life .Abel Magwitch, who is the convict who helps Pip earn a better life, is also played very similar to the character in the novel. I also felt that Joe was depicted essentially as the character in the book, and he really brings to life his love for Pip despite the fact that Pip at times resents him. Some of the other minor characters are also fun to watch: Mr. Jaggers, Mr. Wemmick, Mr. Pumblechook, Herbert Pocket, Biddy. The great thing about Dickens' characters is that they are unique and, at times, eccentric and, as a viewer, you can readily identify those characteristics as they come up in the film.

Another aspect of the film that was refreshing was just the scenery. The scene at the beginning with Pip encountering the convict in the cemetery, the grassland scene at the beginning and the end of the movie, and the dreariness of London (as Pip first arrives) all seem to be very illustrative of the attitude of the film.

One disappointing aspect of the film was that, at times, it was too obvious and blatant. It's almost as if the director decided that people were ""too lazy"" to understand certain parts, so they just thought they'd have a character ""fill in"" exactly what happened  rather than trying to let you decide on your own or show the scene the way it was intended. One example of this is the conflicts between Pip and Orlick.

Approximately 3 hours in length, this film still manages to cut quite a bit from the book and seem relatively short in length. I highly recommend this version, and it is much better than the Ethan Hawke/ Gwyneth Paltrow version of Great Expectations, which is very loose in its translation.

If you are looking for a modernized version of a great classic by Dickens, this is it. This film also works well for any teachers who want to do a comparison between the film and the book.

4  stars"
3491,764006401,5,"First off, our friend below from Aussieland, is not correct.  This IS the performance that aired here on Masterpiece Theatre in 1999 (it like other stuff on the WGBH label includes Russell Baker's openings and closing (singular as he did not do a closing for part 1).  There is another BBC release from 1981 also on DVD which I do not know anything about.  This version came out around the time the ""modern version"" shown on the big screen with Gwyneth Paltrow came out which takes place in modern Miami.  Suffice it to say, this is the second time Masterpiece Theatre aired a true representation of this classic while the big screen put out a flop (the first time was Moll Flanders in 1996 which sad to say the single disc copy I bought here at Amazon is no longer in print and who knows how the double disc rerelease is doing).  Ioan Gruffudd as Pip is as great as his performance in Hornblower.  It also tells most of the story which several of the big screen versions leave out.  If you are building a library of ""Masterpiece Theatre"" classics, then (even though it only aired in 99) this belongs in that library."
3492,764006401,5,"I watched this movie in school the other week, but got sick and missed an entire day. I was bound and determined to see the part I missed, which was the tragic death of Miss. Havisham and Orlick's revenge on Pip, so I got on the internet and searched for about an hour or more to find THIS version and I do not regret it. There are SO many other versions out there but none compare, especially the one with Gwenith Paltrow (*tutts). The cover of that one implies that it's a porn! and the only simularity between the movie and book was the title. Anyways, this movie is the best! It was just so awesome, I cannot even put it into words. The actors were brilliant and the director - phenominal! I do admit that I was a bit dissapointed when I found out that Orlick merely met Pip on the street and decided to kill him rather than the clever kidnapping, and I was looking for at least a wince from Pip after being burned severely. But, I guess, the producers had to make it fit into at least two tapes. Anyways, I love this movie. Sure, there were some faults but I can count up a lot more in the Brad Pitt, Gary Oldman, and Leo DiCaprio movies. E-mail me to discuss more! Rachael_g08@yahoo.com"
3493,764006401,1,"Firstly I have to say that this is not a Mobile Masterpiece production it is a BBC production.  The production itself is excellent, my favorite adaption of the Charles Dickens novel.

Unfortunately the DVD has been put together as if you are watching the production on television.  There is an introduction by an American presenter who states that what you are watching is a Mobile production.  This is tolerable but once you start watching you find that little icons appear on the screen as would appear on television (I think they are to inform the viewer that wide screen is available).  Finally, before the end credits of the first part, you get to see what will be in next weeks episode.

It would have been a simple matter to take the original recording as supplied by the BBC and use this one for the DVD.  For some reason the DVD producer decided that is was better to have exactly the same recording as was shown on American television.

If you want to get a copy of this production I would recommend getting one that was made for the British market."
3494,764006401,2,"I've never read Dickens, or watched any movies/tv series based on any his novels, so I don't know what is from the book and what is from the movie director. I really enjoy historical dramas, especially BBC tv series. In this Great Expectations, the acting was good, especially the heartless little Estella. However, what I didn't like about the movie:
1. Too much scenery, not enough interaction. Instead of 10 seconds of Pip walking on the moors, we get 30 seconds. The same goes for birds flying, waves on the water, Pip walking through dark tunnels, Pip walking through dark streets, Pip walking up stairs, Pip rowing a boat. Pip opening doors and walking down dark hallways. Lots of extended scenes of scenery and no character conversations. Also, there're lots of scenes of Pip and Miss Haversham, Joe and the convict. But, there's next to no scenes of Pip and the love of his life, the grown-up Estella. Which leads to the next point:
2. As a result of the lack of scenes with Pip and Estella, we hear secondhand that she's unhappy, and we only hear Pip say that he's in love. The editing/screenplay is so choppy that we never hear why or how. I guess we are to assume from 10 minutes of the movie that Pip loves her madly because she is pretty and treats him very cooly.
I mean, honestly, we get what's got to be a total of 30 minutes of boring scenery in the movie, and then almost none of the adult Pip falling in love with Estella, or what happens to Estella after marriage?
3. Discontinuity. I don't understand why Estella is so heartless and cruel as a child, then comes back as a soft mannered, kindly seeming lady. Is this a gentleman-trap of some sort?
I give this 2 stars because the acting was very good, but the storyline is super choppy, cryptic, and unbalanced.  It would have been better if more time had been spent on explaining the plot instead of long panoramas of the scenery."
3495,764006401,5,"It's an unique adaptation of Charles Dickens' ""Great Expectations"", but still, it's not as good as John Mills' ""Great Expectations"" (1947).
In John Mills' ""Great Expectations"" the events are well-focused, and Miss Havisham is meaner and crueler than in this movie. So it's better to see John Mills' ""Great Expectations"", or to read the book before seeing this movie.
Two things I did not like in this movie, the ""WIDE"" logo which appear on the screen every 15 minutes, and the narrator who appears on the beginning of the movie. We want to have fun not a lecture.
Ioan Gruffudd (Horatio Hornblower) performance is excellent as always, he proved that he always conquer, in love and war."
3496,764006401,4,"First let me say that I adore Ioan Gruffud and Justine Waddell, and their work, in this and in other films. And therein lies my (mild) dissatisfaction with this movie: there really are not a lot of scenes with the two together, focussing on their thwarted love. In particular, there is not a lot of development of Estella, so that her actions seem a bit difficult to understand. Why is she marrying that thug of a suitor? Is it an act of will on her part, and is she really so desparate to get any from Miss. Havisham? And if so, why not marry Pip, or anyone else for that matter? Pip confronts Miss. Havisham with the stated fact that Estella is suffering badly; however, we don't SEE this. A cardinal sin in moviemaking is to TELL instead of SHOW. And there are disappointingly few scenes, as I said, developing the love story, which tends to distance the viewer from Pip's pain. In particular, there is a dearth of scenes with Justine Waddell in them, which is quite hard to take, if you are a fan of hers, like myself. I was a little appeased that Ioan Gruffud was in practically every scene, hence my decision to give it four stars. Bernard Hill also was impressively protean as the initially threatening, but ultimately paternal Maggwitch. Charlotte Rampling was her usual luminous self, creating a peculiarly attractive Miss. Havisham. One wonders how her fiance could ever have abandoned her. To conclude, I was a little disappointed, but the film was worth the time and money I spent. I would highly recommend that Waddell fans search out her other work. She has been much better used in other vehicles, such as Tess of the D'urbervilles and Wives and Daughters (both are Mobile Masterpiece Theater productions, I believe). She also starred in a movise made in the U.K., ""The One and Only"", unfortunately not available in the U.S. yet."
3497,764006401,3,"This is a Master Theatre Version made in 1999, of Dickens' oft-filmed book which comes with stunningly beautiful photography and most strange decision about adapting the original book.  As if to resist the Americanized version starring Ethan Hawke made the year before, this film version, as far as I know, is the least romantic one ever made.  Whether or not you like the film solely depends on this aspect, so let me tell you about it first.
The story is comparatively faithfiul, spending about 3 hours to cover the story of Pip, an apprentice of blacksmith who unwisely perhaps, falls in love with cold-hearted Estella.  But the film, as I said, gives more stress on darker side of the book, so the love theme is not explored as deep as other versions such as David Lean's or Alfonso Cuaron's.  Rather, the newer version seems to give more emphasis on the Pip's guilty feelings deep rooted in his contact with the runaway convict Magwitch, and the film's way of shooting the famous opening of the book, which relates their encounter on the graveyard in the marshes, gives us no time for savoring Dickensian humor.  The film uses the technique of flash-back, in order to express Pip's fear, which, I am afraid, is overdone for its own sake.
I do not follow every details of the story (you probably have read the book), but I have to say this; like I said, this film is endowed with least amount of humor and romance.  Sure, you see Wemmick's most casual wedding; you see Biddy, Joe, Herbert (not all Pockets however), but you cannot expect to find any humorous scnes, one of Dickens' trademarks.  So, when Pip recounts how he met Miss Havisham before his sister and Pumblechook, he is literally forced to talk.  As you know, this is one of the humourous scenes of the original -- even though the humor is downplayed -- where we can see Pip makes up his own story, which gets more and more outrageous as he goes on.  But the director here didn't seem to see that way, depicting the whole incident as simply terrifying one for Pip, who must receive as much scolding and harsh words from them, as if in a tortune.
Justine Waddle, often cast in costume dramas, is good as grown-up Estella, but before she could show something, the film goes on to follow the story of Pip, who must face bravely several darker moments of life (you know what I mean -- Orlick and Themes River), thus making least use of romance between Pip and her.  Actually, the film shows more of mud (of London and Pip's village) and decay, so the first thing Pip sees in London is the butchered cattles hanging on the hook.  It is true that Dickens' original book tells how Pip, arriveing in London for the first time in his life, wanders around Smithfield, then an open-sir cattle market, but ... do we need to know that?
The portrayal of Gruffudd's grown-up Pip is so-so, but the most disappointed thing about the film is Charlotte Rampling's Miss Havisham.  Not that her acting is bad, but her Havisham simply does not convince me, being too weak in her gestures.  She should be more authentic as this witch-like woman often found in fairy tales, who commands people, not just talks.  If she does not follow the flamboyant acting of Anne Bancroft, that is OK.  I just need more enticing mystery in this enigmatic, willful woman, Havisham.
Overall not bad if you look for bleak atmosphere in Dickens.  But for those who seeks for humor and romance in him, this is not the one to see."
3498,764006401,2,"I guess I'm the only one disappointed in the Masterpiece Theater adaptation of Great Expectations, but I was.  Ioan Gruffudd is a fine actor, but he is no Pip.  The only aspect of his portrayal I liked was his devotion to Estella.  Even his horror at discovering the identity of his real benefactor was too ""subtle"" and too short-lived.
I was even more disappointed in Charlotte Rampling's Miss Havisham.  She was too young, too soft-spoken, and too kindly -- not at all cold and distant -- and not at all manipulative.  And the scene of her incineration is terribly overdone.
From the beginning ... in which we are told of Pip's visit to the graveyard ... to the end ... which is not at all in keeping with the spirit of Dickens' ambiguous ending ... this was a true disappointment.
The Anthony Calf, Anthony Hopkins production for the Disney Channel is far superior.  I wish that one were offered for sale."
3499,764006401,4,"of this version of the classic.  So dark and mysterious yet the costuming was lush and beautiful.  It felt a bit rushed at some points, but the character portrayals were extremely well done.  Highly recommend this one with Great Expectations."
3500,764006401,4,"Great Expectations is easily my favorite of the Dickens classics.  With that being said, normally when you translate a book into a movie, something is lost in the shuffle.  Mobile Masterpiece Theater has done a marvelous job, though capturing the heart of the tale.
Iaon Gruffuddd, of A&E's spectacular Horatio Hornblower series, does a good job as an adult Pip, however in his days working as Joe's apprentice I did not really feel that he adequately conveyed Pip's disatisfaction at being there very well or appearing embarrassed once he does come into his fortune and Joe visits.
Joe, on the other hand, is portrayed perfectly, as is Pip's aunt Miss Havisham and Estella.  The plot is followed accurately, though at a breakneck speed, which causes the story to feel a bit rushed.  All in all, though, it is a fairly good interpretation that anyone who enjoys the story would do well to pick up."
3501,764006401,3,"We just got done watching this movie in my literature class because we read the book. I must say that when I started the book I didn`t have a very open mind; the very beginning of the story seems a little trivial and is certainly not the most exciting point of the story. When I`d been through about six chapters I wasn`t enjoying it, though I`d read worse. But we watched the first forty minutes of this movie and I was fascinated by the eerie, dark mood it portrayed. Watching this version definitely helped me to enjoy the book from then on. Dickens really did do an excellent job of setting the mood and the dark atmospere in ""Great Expectations"", and whoever made this movie knew the right way to show the same mood on film. I think the creators of this movie also knew the book genuinely inside and out, which is what I infer from the phenomenal choice of cast members. The actors chosen to play both the young and older Pip, Abel Magwitch, Miss Havisham, Jaggers, and Wemmick were all simply perfect for the roles. In fact, all the actors were extremely fitting, except the one actress who played Estella - she wasn`t neccesarily the way I`d imagined the grown-up Estella to be like, at least, but she did carry out the part well enough. There is some dialogue and a few scenes at the end that stray a little far from the book, but the ending was the one thing I wasn`t neccesarily satisfied with in the book anyway. I think I even like the ending in this movie better."
3502,764006401,3,"This movie is decent, but takes many liberties with Dickens' story, and changes a lot about the characters.  Charlotte Rampling's Miss Havisham is much too lucid, young, and sane - not to mention clean (this woman is supposed to have worn the same outfit for decades).  There is a lot of footage of nature, which is silly, considering that so much of what was in the book had to be cut.  Several specific incidents from the book are completely changed."
3503,764006401,5,"This is one of my favorite mini-series based on the 1800's. I have seen it twice on t.v and it is as good as if not better than Pride &Predudice, David Copperfield, Wives and Daughters, Dr Bell &Mr Doyle, and others. I really liked the characters and the actors and the whole thing was done beutifully. I recommend to anyone who likes period style dramas.(And Ioan Gruffudd!) It is so much better than the movie with Ethan and Gwyneth. Fantastic!"
3504,764004581,5,"I have just finished writing my book about war, etc. titled: ""A Tiger called Nancy."" While flying in and out of Cambodia (1975) I saw many flight crews and ground people that had their story ended in 40 seconds (or  less). The ending of Hell in the Pacific could have been more satisfying  but I believe the directors (producers) point was to show the irrational  (illogical) main feature of the incredibly stupid game called  ""war.""  Two guys finally get the point but...they lose."
3505,764003828,5,"I am only 12 and I think this is one of my favorite movies. Woody Allen is great, and the movie gives you surprises all the way through. The movie is narrarated like a crime special on tv wich makes it even funnier."
3506,764003828,5,"Since I first viewed this gem in the late 70s on TV, I have never been the same.  After countless viewings, the film still manages to crack me up.  Woody was at his all time best with this, his directorial debut.  Fantastic  satire of prison/crime films done in a part ""drama"", part mock  biography- style.  If you have never seen this:  WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?  A 100% laugh riot."
3507,764004581,4,"Filmed well , but not realistic! The two protagonist would of killed each other @ the start!"

It is well done and filled with excitement. I know you will like it as I did."
3511,764004581,5,2 great actors
3512,764004581,3,"BOTTOM LINE: IF you're a fan of big screen toughguy Lee Marvin, director John (DELIVERANCE) Boorman, or legendary Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune, then you may enjoy this. The slipshod script is the real villain of this WWII-flavored take on THE DEFIANT ONES. If nothing else, the gorgeous South Seas location scenery is worth gawking at. Some solid bonus content adds value. The nice hi-def transfer helps make this a marginal recommend. 3 STAR film, 4 STAR Blu-ray

THOUGHTS: With a couple of top-notch stars like this film has, it should have been a singular masterpiece. Instead, the scattershot screenplay has so many inconsistencies and head-scratching lapses in logic that it makes what otherwise could have been a great motion picture merely an interesting diversion. For instance: these guys spend how many months/years together, and yet neither one bothers to learn at least some of the other fellow's language? Basic communication is essential to increase the odds of survival and/or rescue, not to mention simply making their co-existence more bearable. Instead, they spend the film's entire running time screaming at one another in their native tongue. For cryin' out loud, they never even bother to learn each other's names! Really?!? Sorry, not buying it. Totally unrealistic. There's also a very unfocused transition as they go from enemies who first try and kill each other, then just try to annoy each other, then capture one another and torture the other guy... to just suddenly being too exhausted to fight, so they become tolerant acquaintances. Huh??? The downbeat ending is a nice try at poignant irony, but also falls flat in its execution. (The alternate ending, equally as depressing, isn't much better.) Again, I blame ALL of this film's problems on its script, which should've had another two or three passes, at the minimum, in order to eliminate the annoying incongruities and make the narrative flow better. Both actors are excellent, the direction is steady & solid, the cinematography is outstanding and the minimalist musical score is good. However, none of that can overcome a bad script and HELL IN THE PACIFIC has a muddling, mediocre script - at best.

THE BLU-RAY: Now the good news for fans of this film. The hi-def release of HELL IN THE PACIFIC sports a really nice transfer. The picture is crisp & clean, with solid blacks, strong mid-tones, and not much in the way of artifacting, pixelation or crush (video noise). The original film grain is also wonderfully evident, (no DNR tampering/overscrubbing!). The audio portion is clear and the soundmix is level. There are a half dozen or so bonus features, including interviews with the director and the art director, and a full-length audio commentary track, which help make this Blu-ray a solid bargain. If you love this film, this Blu-ray is a must-own. Casual viewers will still find much to admire, and lots of beautiful scenery to hold their attention. A nice hi-def effort from the crew at Kino Lorber."

3514,764004581,5,"This was way better than I expected. - and nothing like what I was expecting.
Toshro Mifune and Lee Marvin are both exceptional actors in very different arenas of story telling.
Unless you are bilingual in Japanese and English - TURN ON THE SUBTITLES.
Both of these men bring an entire new depth to they portrayal abilities - one we have not had a chance to see before.
Ok - what is it about - it is what happens when two enemies are isolated together.
I cannot mess with your surprise and enjoyment by telling the story - and do check out the alternate ending.
This is a piece of work that is a clear cut above what gets an Oscar nomination.  It is a true classic."
3515,764004581,5,  Yes sir!  Thanks.  Continued customer.
3516,764004581,5,as expected.
3517,764004581,3,The dark scenes are very grainy on this Blu-ray compared to my old DVD.  Very disappointed.  Great film though.  I may just go back to watching the DVD instead.
3518,764004581,5,Hell in the Pacific staring Lee Marvin and TosHiro Mifune there are only two actors in this movie but they are great its a wonderful movie witch proves if these two can get along any body can excellent Blu-ray.
3519,764004581,5,"A terrific third feature from director John Boorman (""Point Blank"",""Excalibur"", ""The Emerald Forest"", ""Deliverance"", ""Zardoz"", ""Hope and Glory"" and the excoriated ""Exorcist II: Heretic"" which crashed and burned so badly that it damage his career for a time ) uses a premise that has been mined for other movies (most notably ""Enemy Mine""). Two enemies (Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune ) on opposite sides of the war end up stranded on a deserted island together. At first they fight for resources before realizing that they need each other to escape back to civilization.

Boorman does a terrific job setting up his compositions (with legendary cinematographer Conrad Hall), working with the actors. Both Mifune and Marvin were old enough to serve during World War II so, no doubt, brought some of the memories of the racist view that the Americans and Japanese had of each other during that time. I have to say that I prefer the alternate ending to the one that played in theaters as it doesn't pay off on the journey these two enemies make to becoming friends as they work towards a common goal.

The Blu-ray release from Kino does a good job of presenting the film. The film looks a bit soft in its presentation but I don't doubt this is what the film probably looked like originally during its theatrical run and the intent of Hall. It's always hard to judge because memory can be unreliable. The depth is a bit problematic at times while detail and colors are pretty good.

The audio is presented in 2.0 channel and sounds solid enough.  Lalo Schifrin's score sounds quite nice. We get subtitles in English only (although the Japanese dialog is subtitled in English as well).

Kino provides some interesting and very good special features. Unfortunately, we don't get a commentary track from Boorman but there is a 30 minute interview with him discussing the film. The commentary by Film Historians Travis Crawford and Bill Ackerman is quite good covering the history of the production and various tidbits. The alternate ending is seamlessly branched so you can choose that ending (which I feel is superior but you may have a different opinion if you saw this when it was originally theatrically released). Art director Anthony Pratt  weighs in the production design for the minimalist film in a 11 minute featurette. Kinko also provides five trailers (but curiously not one for ""Hell In the Pacific"").

""Hell In The Pacific"" is an exceptional film. It's a pity that we don't get any sort of surround mix for the sound (it could be that the 2.0 mix is the only remaining version of the soundtrack). I would give this 4 1/2 stars for the alternate ending version and 4 stars for the original theatrical version."
3520,764004581,3,one of the best movies I've ever seen. this DVD was grainier than the original movie.

3531,764003828,2,"I had fond memories of TTMAR. So I watched it for the first time in 30 years. Now I find the movie lacking. TTMAR is very funny at times but the romance part did nothing for me (the scenes seem reminiscent of other late 60's movies I haven't watched in some time either. A man and a woman, Two for the Road?) and the gags are both too erratic and too far in between."
3532,764003828,5,An old favorite. Still one of his best.
3533,764003828,5,"""He is always very depressed. I think that if he'd been a successful criminal, he would have felt better. You know, he never made the 'ten most wanted' list. It's very unfair voting; it's who you know. ""

Take the Money and Run, one of my top 2 Woody Allen films, nice to finally have on Blu-ray! Hoping for a Blu-ray release of ""Play it Again Sam"" one day

The video transfer while not perfect, is still very good. Grain and thus Detail appear left intact leaving a theatrical look.  Given the low budget of the film and way it was made may make this the best the film will ever look on a home video release...

Ending this review as I'm ""Gonna go see Miss Liza, Gonna go to Mississippi"""
3534,764003828,5,"I remember this movie from the 1070's, it is so funny"
3535,764003828,5,arrived in great shape
3536,764003828,5,Great old thing
3537,764004581,5,"Great movie, a study in human relationships."
3538,764004581,5,great old movie
3539,764004581,4,"Quite a strange movie actually, at once appearing simple but also complex, and the nihilist ending will not please many.

Strictly a ""two-hander"", (Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune), the latter speaking only Japanese throughout...no subtitles. You have to rely on Marvin's dialogue, and Mifune's expression. Now this is not as hard as it may sound.

It's also burdened with what has to be the weirdest selection of music as the soundtrack, varying from full church organ, loud discordant atonal concrete music and what surely has to be the sounds of air being allowed to escape from the stretched neck of a rubber balloon at one stage!

A basic story on the surface, just the two men from opposing armies, enemies marooned on an otherwise deserted Pacific island, struggling not only to survive, but hold each other at bay.
At first the motivations seem to be to kill, but gradually that changes to a power play for dominance over and degradation of the other.
The upper hand changes, but gradually realisation sets in that they will have to work together to survive, or even just get along.
The astute may note that as the two are gradually stripped of the trappings of civilisation, they in fact eventually become more ""civilized"", ....and when later some of the outward comforts of the civilised world are available to them,such as clean clothes, shaving and alcohol/cigarettes/magazines, they then fall back into barbarism.
Performances are good, ....although Marvin is perhaps a little too old for the character he's playing. The settings are genuine and their misery well-portrayed as they fight off thirst, starvation and the elements, ...even the sheer boredom.
There is a somewhat odd scene where Marvin tries to teach Mifune to retrieve a stick as a dog would....Mifune is tied most uncomfortably to some sort of a large branch at the time as well as  being hobbled.
Just who is teaching whom is open to interpretation as Mifune refuses and remains mute and impassive.....while Marvin continually demonstrates the demeaning task.
Realising that no one is coming to rescue them, eventually the two begin to tolerate each other, then go further to co-operate enough to build a raft substantial enough to get over the surrounding reef.
This being achieved, they sail off on the open ocean in search of rescue.
A plane is heard, but when Marvin tries to use an old whistle to attract attention, Mifune grabs it and throws it into the water. Just why he does this is unclear.
Eventually the raft drifts to some islands and upon coming ashore the two discover what seems to be a large abandoned military fortified gun emplacement. There are tense moments trying to discover whether it is Japanese or American, and tellingly, Marvin becomes concerned that the eagerly exploring Mifune may be shot by some American forces due to his being Japanese.
Marvin repeatedly cries out ""Don't shoot...don't shoot....he's my FRIEND!""
Mifune appears suddenly from the debris, frightening Marvin who exclaims ""Oh I thought you were a Japanese!""
The point being that although he IS Japanese, Marvin has begun to think of him as something more than just a racial type with whom his country is at war.

It becomes clear that the base is now abandoned after what must have been some heavy fighting, but the two find clothes and saki to salvage, and also clean themselves up, then begin to enjoy some camaraderie over a few drinks.

Another weird scene ensues with Marvin drunkenly asking Mifune why the Japanese don't believe in God.
Marvin himself, (the actor) appears very ill-at-ease performing this bit and it's not entirely successful.
Nor is the reason for this uncomfortable scene at all clear.
Then the pair suddenly become estranged again as Mifune sees some very graphic pictures of slain Japanese in an old Life magazine and wartime hatreds emerge once more.
Then, ...just as you think we will see if their hard-won friendship from the island and the raft journey will last or they will once again become sworn enemies......BANG! That nihilistic ending I previously mentioned happens and that's it.

Many will feel they have sat through a long movie where not a lot of action has happened, only to be denied a proper denouement.
I must admit it looked to me like they didn't quite know how to end it, and so went with the Apocalypse.
You may of course feel differently, but the movie as it stands remains largely a psychological study of two men, rather than any war-action piece.

WARNING: Do NOT watch if the title has you hoping to see some Audie Murphy/John Wayne heroics, with intense battle scenes.
You will be MAJORLY disappointed!

I enjoyed it for the power struggle and the humanity emerging over the nationalism, along with the performances, but must admit to finding the ending far too sudden and a most unsatisfactory way to dispose of two characters you have come to know over such a long movie.
Does it all count for nothing?
I wanted to see what they would do back in a world at war. Would they remain friends, or return to the roles that the war demanded they perform?
I believe some copies include an alternate ending. Mine does not but it is available on You-Tube, and is only about a minute long.
It too is enigmatic, not really telling you all that much about what happened next.

Four stars overall for me. (One off definitely for the ending.)
I have the MRA DVD, ...transfer is good (but not brilliant) and the sound quite loud."
3540,764004581,5,Epic film considering Marvin was wounded during his service in the Pacific as a marine. He was there and did that without treatment for PTSD
3541,764004581,4,If it weren't for Lee Marvin it would no be much of a movie.
3542,764004581,5,Thanks
3543,764004581,4,"I saw this film when it was released and went to see it again and it had the alternate ending. That really blew my mind! I remember standing up in the theater and yelling, ""WHAT?"" People looked at me like I was nuts! I asked the theater manager how the heck can this be and he had no clue.
So, now searching for a blu ray edition of this great Lee Marvin flick to no avail. I sure wish they'd release a nice blu ray version. I love this movie.
I've had the DVD for years now and it's a good version but with these new flat screen OLED (LG has them and this year Panasonic will too) sets that are out now, even a 4K version would be really cool. Watching good movies is a great pass time and with all this new technology in HD, it's just like going back in time and having these great works of art alive and living right in your own home! Don't forget the surround sound!
Looking forward to a blu ray of this some day or even a 4K version. This movie is made for ""watching"", pick your own ending. Geez......."
3544,764004581,5,Love this movie..
3545,764004581,5,A classic.
3546,764004581,5,Love this movie. I read about the personal relationship that developed between these two actors during the making of the film and you can see it progress throughout the movie. Lee Marvin was a combat Marine in the Pacific during WWII and makes this a very realistic film.
3547,764003828,5,Best Woody Allen ever :)
3548,764003828,5,Not surprised. Big fan of woody Allen. Good comedy and good acting. Highly recommend
3549,764003828,5,By far the FUNNIEST Woody Allen movie ever made..
3550,764003828,5,Great for out grandson.
3551,764003828,5,Probably better than Bananas for pure slapstick!  Nothing funnier than him playing the cello in the marching band!  Parents wearing the Groucho Marx disguises just hysterical!
3552,764003828,5,A classic. One of Woody's best!
3553,764003828,5,I love everything Woody Allen does in the movies and this is just a great example. I hope he makes many more movies before he casts off this mortal coil we call ' life'!
3554,764003828,5,GREAT BUY  . UNABLE TO FIND TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN ANYWHERE ELSE.
3555,764003828,5,I had a time follwing the plot in this movie and it seem that the movie didn't go anywhere
3556,764003828,5,"Came as promised, and in good condition."
3557,764004581,5,AWESOME!
3558,764004581,5,A Christmas gift for my son. I'll probably never see it
3559,764004581,1,"Does not work in US.To costly to return, Why are these DVD sent to States,if known to be defective?"
3560,764004581,5,"This item was delivered within the promised time frame and was in excellent condition.  The description of the movie itself was accurate.  I had seen this movie years ago as a child and did not remember very much of it, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and, as other reviews had mentioned, there were two endings.  The first was abrupt and disappointing, but after watching the ""alternate ending"", I was satisfied!"
3561,764004581,3,"so,so,plot"
3562,764004581,3,"British director John Boorman's 1968 consideration of the  tremendously vicious hemispheric Pacific conflict of WW II is a brief, but unfortunately unsatisfying examination of the here leaderless, very dirty hand-to-hand combat that was island-hopping in the war.  Both Lee Marvin (who actually served as a Marine during the war in his youth) , and Mifune, a Japanese ""star"" of quite respectable dramatic stature give fine, necessarily muted performances.  But the plot sort of drifts lazily back and forth in the Pacific Palau, in a dreamy would-be interpretation of individual land-ops which one-on-one combat most assuredly should not  (cinematically) at least) be.  To do Boorman credit, Marvin does eventually bring the subject of the (Christian) God into the confrontation, but it's pretty much too late, and the audience leaves with the somewhat dull effect of having watched a war fought between business boardrooms, one democratic and one fascist, and who really needs that kind of history, if only merely dramatic?  Sadly, once again, ""Old men start wars...young men finish them."""
3563,764004581,5,Thanks
3564,764004581,5,AS expected
3565,764004581,4,good entertainment
3566,764003828,1,"Boo.  Shame on me for thinking I had found a widescreen version.
This is a Korean bootleg from the 4:3 fit-to-tv version cropped and squashed, with the MGM trademark screen removed at the beginning.  I would return it, except I do not want anyone else to suffer the purchase.  This was sold as a Region 0 disk.

Avoid, and hope that one day a real full screen version will come out in U.S."
3567,764003828,3,funny moments
3568,764003828,5,You won't stop laughing
3569,764003828,5,Classic Woody!
3570,764003828,5,"Loved it, Still made me laugh after seeing this moving for the first time over 20 years ago!!!"
3571,764003828,1,$60.00 for this DVD???? That's funnier than the actual movie itself.
3572,764003828,5,"This was one of Woody Allen's first film ventures and his first film for general release.  It was 100% pure fun and by far his most 'accessible' film for all audiences.  You will note that it had aspects of Saturday Night live and much of the comedy that we're used to.  Note that this was long before SNL and spinoffs like Animal House or Trading Places.  Woody invented some of this humor.
The plot is straightfoward: Woody Allen plays a chronically challenged underachiever(as always) with a long-suffering girlfriend/spouse.  He finally holds up a bank and does it in the way only Woody could.  The sight gags, blackout sketches, and double-entendre(inside jokes) are relentless and great.  Whatever you see that's inventive and reminds you of something else, remember that it was invented here, probably.
I recommend this film as a must-have for Woody Allen devotees and anyone who wants a good silly comedy.  I've never met anyone who didn't like this..."
3573,764003828,5,Funney
3574,764003828,5,"Funny, not as funny as I remembered... Perhaps the (medical) marihuana made a differance."
3575,764003828,5,"Great seller, fast shipping and product just as described. Highly recommended."
3576,764008722,4,"What is it about Robson Green that makes him so compelling? Is it his piercing blue eyes, or the sense that, no matter how inscrutable his expression, there's so much more going on inside his head that we're not privy to? Green is in no way what one might consider a Hollywood-type leading man--he appears small, his hairline is receding, and he's not conventionally handsome--but the man commands the screen like nobody's business.
I found ""Touching Evil"" to be a fantastic series, so when ""TE 2"" became available, I grabbed it. Unfortunately, it took me some time to watch all the episodes. Perhaps this was because I was so impressed with the first series that I had high expectations. Maybe it was ""sophomore slump."" Ah, it was probably that the story arc of the first series was just plain more interesting. It is often the case that when the original creators of a series relinquish creative control to others, the quality suffers. This is also true of ""TE 2,"" which sometimes seems like a pale reflection of the original. What it still has going for it, however, is the characters. I very much appreciate the circularity of the stories, bringing characters--like Creegan's wife and kids--in and out of the story at various points throughout the series. Shaun Dingwall alternately impresses and annoys with his portrayal of the unsteady DI Rivers, and Nicola Walker--another unconventional look but undeniably powerful--just knocks my socks off when she takes Creegan to task every so often. Maybe that's the key to why I enjoy the world of ""Touching Evil"" so much: It feels like family.
And although I would love to see Robson Green in more visible projects, I sort of hope Hollywood never finds out about him. They just wouldn't know what to do with him."
3577,764008722,5,"I bought this video specifically to see my all time favorite Scottish actor, Tony Curran, play the sinister serial killer, Emerson. I was not disappointed by any of the three episodes in this set, however. I recommend this video to any fan of cop drama and/or mysteries."
3578,764008722,5,"Im British, so I saw Touching Evil way before the US but though I cant seem to find series 2 or 3 on video, I remember quite clearly Touching Evil 2 was the most thrilling, chilling and involved in the characters as any of the series before or after. The first series dealt mostly with Robson Green, but the second delved into Walker and Dingwall's characters and their relatioships with each other, which became really interesting. The end of the second and thrid videos will blow you away!"
3579,764008722,5,"I first ""discovered"" the Touching Evil series when I was flipping through the channels and landed on PBS Mysteries!  I've always enjoyed mysteries, especially British-made mysteries, so I decided to watch  it.  It is one of the most riveting mystery shows I have ever seen.  The  characters are not the typical mystery dectectives who typically seem to  magically know what happened at the end of the show.  You have to struggle  to find the answers right along with the characters, and they don't always  do the right thing.  I have bought both Touching Evil 1 and Touching Evil  2, and I'm anxiously awaiting Touching Evil 3 which will be on PBS sometime  later this year."
3580,764004581,4,Hell of a flick.
3581,764004581,5,top ten for me
3582,764004581,4,An interesting movie
3583,764004581,5,"I remembered watching this movie years ago and loving it. It never came on TV much at all over the years, so I had to have the DVD. It is a great story told with very few words. It's amazing how entertaining it is without much speaking. Great acting by both men."
3584,764004581,4,Fascinating film diverging from most war flicks in its presentation of the protagonists and their eventual grudging accommodation to their circumstances. Withheld a fifth star as I didn't like the ending.
3585,764004581,5,Very satisfied.
3586,764004581,5,great movie!
3587,764004581,5,Lee Marvin & Actor  Toshiro Mifune  Are OUTSTANDING In This DRAMA.  They are Two Enemies Trapped Alone in a Desert Island.  BOTH Of Their Performances  were Well Etched/  A Searing Psychological Drama!!!!  A MUST SEE ON A VERY LARG SCREEN!!!  It Should Be Shown On an I-MAX Screen!!!!!!!!!
3588,764004581,5,"I love this movie, it is very well made, and it has a very good life lesson, I'm glad I found it."
3589,764004581,5,The incomparable Lee Marvin and the talented Toshiru Mifune star in the interesting WWII tale of an American GI and a Japanese soldier stranded together on an island in the South Pacific during WWII.
3590,764003828,5,Great Woody Allan flick still going strong into the future
3591,764003828,3,"Woody Allen's uneven crime mockumentary marked his directorial debut. Despite its rough-edged quality, ""Take the Money and Run"" (1969) maintains a steady flow of visual and verbal humor. Allen successfully develops his comic persona in his first starring role. Even by today's standards, the film holds up better than most of Woody's recent output. Strangely out of print, the Anchor Bay DVD includes widescreen and full-screen versions."
3592,764003828,5,Classic slapstick humor movie by Woody Allen. Silly. Funny.
3593,764003828,4,The sound quality of this DVD wasn't the best but it's still a funny movie!  The sound seemedto be muffled.
3594,764003828,4,"Woodys personal life is in question.........But his great movies are not....... true dry humor classic......They don,t make em like that anymore...."
3595,764003828,5,Woody Allen's Take the Money and Run is one of my favorites amount his great movies.  It is hilarious!  I love it!
3596,764003828,5,"Great old fashion light corny humor, great film clarity for 1969.  It will keep you laughing. I definitely recommend this movie"
3597,764003828,5,"Ordered movie which came on time in excellent condition, watched it, enjoyed it! As simple as that. Wish similar services would be a norm!
Monika P. - Midwest"
3598,764003828,4,"This movie will make you laugh til you cry, it really is hilarious from beginning to end. Woody Allen is at his best in this film that he also directed.

 I'm giving it 4 stars as I did not like Janet Margolin as his girlfriend in this movie, thought a better choice could have been made to play this role. She seemed to be reading the lines throughout, not breathing any life into the role.

Other than that, loved everything about this film. A great pick me up if you've had a bad day and need some big laughs. This one is a keeper!"
3599,764003828,1,I would assume that anything they list on Amazon would work in the US.  But my DVD player kept saying it was the wrong country.  I ended up throwing it away.  Buyer be ware.
3600,764004581,5,"this movie is more than the sum of all the other films about world war two combined. it is a true classic. both men are superb and make us believe what has been said in the past: ""that all wars begin and end within the hearts of men."""
3601,764004581,5,I love Lee Marvin and this is no comedy.  Two actors is all you get and all you need in an unusual predicament.  It does have moments of Dark Humor.  Put yourself in this quite human situation and imagine what you would do as these actors give it to you so realistically .  It it one of those movies not often shown but you never forget it.
3602,764004581,5,"Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune (you may remember him from Seven Samurai) with only one chance for survival, very entertaining."
3603,764004581,3,"I ordered this DVD for my husband who is a Lee Marvin fan. He had seen it years ago, and wanted to see it again.  He was rather disappointed in it.  There was no dialog, no other actors, and a rather pointless plot."
3604,764004581,4,"What's not to like? Except the ending...Jesus, who wrote that ending? Marvin a real Marine in WWII who actually killed Japanese on Guadalcanal as a 19 year old, played a total realistic part. Mifume, the greatest actor to ever come out of Japan plays a smart realistic soldier. I cannot add more that what others have written on here."
3605,764004581,4,this is a movie that i owened on tape yrs. ago. it is an exellant movie so i bought it again on dvd and recomend it to every one
3606,764004581,5,"Waited for years for this classic to go on DVD.  It previously was only available on VHS tape.  It has an alternate ending which is good to see.  The two protagonists: Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune start as enemies and discover that they need each other for survival.  The similarity to Robinson Crusoe is striking, except they both are on equal footing.  These two men are two of the greatest movie actors of all time.  It is a great pleasure to see them together.  There are very few copies for collectors out there so, get this one while you can."
3607,764004581,5,This is an excellent movie if you are a lee Marvin fan you will like this overlooked movie. Good plot and makes good use of the area where they filmed from.
3608,764004581,1,"It wasn't the movie, The movie was broken when I got it and it would of cost me more to send it back."
3609,764004581,3,This is an interesting take on a more personal view on warfare - as Lee Marvin was a marine in real life in WWII.
3610,764003828,1,"Should make it clearer in the description that it won't play on any domestic player. Tried to cancel order just a few hours after sending but got it anyway.

Seller was fine, quick shipping and decent packing but what good is that if the item is not usable in this country. Should list these items in a separate section. Very disappointing. Have sent it back."
3611,764003828,4,"this is not the first movie in which woody allen starred.  however, it was the first movie which would form the pattern for the rest of his movie making life. ergo, he scripted it, directed it and starred in it.  if you followed his earlier standup act, this first movie captures the shtick he established with that act.  he is a character who can do nothing right yet he wants to be a criminal mastermind, especially with robbing banks.  he has some great comic moments in this film. in one he attempts to play a cello in a marching band.  in another he tries to escape prison using a gun he carved out of soap but it rains. these are great comic set ups and sketches.

the romance he sets up involves the female archtype we see in every woody allen movie. she is young, good looking, bright and, most importantly, not Jewish. his pursuit of the ultimate shiksa will continue in virtually every subsequent film. he gets better at this when he starts using Diane Keaton, followed by Mia Farrow.

many people would have liked woody allen to continue making comic movies like this one for the rest of his life. instead of continuing with this broad farce style, he would develop his own blend of combining comedy with tragedy instead.

i liked this film and laughed a lot but i'm glad he did not spend over forty years making variations of it. one of allen's biggest inspirations, the Marx Brothers, especially Groucho, did slight variations of the same comedic shtick over their entire professional lives.  allen took much bigger artistic risks by not sticking to these broad comedic setup gags.

3612,764003828,4,"I have followed Woody Allen since his standup days, and this film is critical in understanding his long evolution from comic to film-maker. Unless you've already seen some of his best films, Match Point, Hannah... or the other ""early funny ones"", I would look elsewhere. The film was original in the 60s, but it feels dated now. Sleeper holds up better."
3613,764003828,5,"Some may not agree that this was his best but I found it hysterical.
I found it pure fun as I don't remember it having any political or heavy social comments as most of his films do."
3614,764003828,5,"Very well conditioned
Good image and sound
I recommend it for all lovers of Woody Allen movies and all movie lovers"
3615,764003828,1,"Does not work.
Screen states ""this cannot be rewound""
Not good to see when entertaining guests.
What's with the minimum word requirement.
Maybe we just don't have the time!"
3616,764003828,2,While the movie was good I accidently ordered  the vhs and the sound went in and out.  I was disappointed.
3617,764003828,3,"I really like this movie, but I didn't notice it was pal region 2 dvd without subtitles of any kind, so bummer"
3618,764003828,2,"I was expecting the picture to be sharper.  Looking at the screen too closely, the images seem to strain the eyes. I don't recommend this product. A bit disappointed."
3619,764003828,1,it is region 2 and I did not notice this when I bought it and the notice should have been larger so I could not play it
3620,764004581,4,"Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune are the only characters in this rather unique film.  Sworn World War II enemies, they find themselves marooned on a desert island together.  The story moves along, as the American and the Japanese gradually learn to mistrust one another less and less.  Even though neither can make himself fully understood to the other, they finally manage to construct a raft together and sail to a different island, formerly occupied by Japanese military, but now abandoned.

Unless the viewer happens to understand Japanese, the only person whose dialogue can be followed is Marvin's.  This is no matter, because one can get the jist of each situation quite easily.  Dubbing in subtitles would have been utterly stupid, not being needed at all.

What this amounts to is a low key anti-war story.  It also features two alternative endings, the first tragic, the second much the opposite.  It's worth watching."
3621,764004581,5,Excellent study of a American Navy pilot and a enemy Japanese Army soldier stranded on a small Pacific island during WWII.  They combat each other with whatever natural weapons that can be found and then realize  their surrival depends on their cooperation.
3622,764004581,5,Bought this movie for my son to see.  Great acting and even a twist.  Some of these old movies (not real old) could thrill a new generation.
3623,764004581,5,"5 Stars = Masterpiece

""Hell in the Pacific"" is one of the greatest movies of it's ilk. Can't even begin to remember the first time I watched it, most likely not long after it was made. A true portrait of two men fighting a war on opposite sides, that only know their on opposite sides, but find out what it is to know your opponent, who may not necessarily be your enemy.

Essential veiwing"
3624,764004581,4,"John Boorman's visualizes Robert S. McNamara's eleventh lesson of life and war; i.e., ""...empathize with your enemy to better understand and combat him"" and takes that notion to the extremes in this fabulous, intense movie metaphor.  Two soldiers -- American and Japanese (movie icons Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifuni) -- stranded on a South Pacific island, determined to fight to the death, instead discover life. A truly great war movie.  And ironically, a greater anti-war movie."
3625,764004581,5,"My husband and I absolutely LOVED this movie!  We first watched it without the subtitles, and it made a really fantastic movie because we were like the American - not really able to figure out what was totally going on.  Then, after the movie, we watched key scenes with the subtitles on and laughed really hard when we were able to see the other point of view.  We want our teenage sons to watch it, and decided we will have them see it the same way.

I highly recommend you watch it without subtitles first.

The only part neither of us liked was the ending.  Here was a wonderful movie that had us on the edge of our seats and even after watching the alternate ending, we both though ""What dummy couldn't figure out how to end this?!?!""  Very jarring.  It's like they ran out of time and money and just threw something at the screen.  Bummer.

Even with the bad ending (we wrote our own in our own heads), the rest of the movie was so spectacular, we give it 5 stars!  Have fun!"
3626,764004581,5,"I really enjoyed this movie many years ago when it first came out.  Just recently found it on Amazon at a very low price.  If you recall, the movie has a sad ending but to my surprise the DVD has two filmed ending.  The other is not sad.  This shows how fruitless war can be."
3627,764004581,4,"Two fine players in a worthwhile examination of the multiple levels of engagement in wartime, culture, and cooperation. A valuable film to see more than once, and to think about, with a historical perspective. Well-recommended."
3628,764004581,3,"Heck in the Pacific (it wasn't Hell). a reasonably goodish movie despite very little dialoge. The abrupt ending was a disapointment , very little thought gone into it. the DVD had an alternate ending but very litlle thought gone into it also. i enjoy japanese movies however the average person would find it boring except for a few places"
3629,764004581,5,I love the view (and the story) of the island.  It's played by 2 top actors.
3630,764003828,1,"I've never seen a worse comedy.  It has a promising idea (that a criminal would fail at every turn) but is so tightly over scripted that you can't even laugh in the wrong places.  There are none of the quirky truthful insights about real life that ""Annie Hall"" later had.  Woody Allen must be an absolutely humorless person.  The only good thing that can be said is that this failure forced him to go in a different direction."
3631,764003828,2,Was not able to play it on my DVD player.  Only works on my laptop.  Would like to be able to view on my television.
3632,764003828,1,"Played fine on my US Spec Blu Ray player but it is not widescreen, it is only 4:3 letterbox. Wait until the actual blu ray comes out."
3633,764003828,4,"This is another, funny interesting comedy from Woody Allen in the vein of his early work. Good stuff. Great comedic style in classic Allen fashion."
3634,764003828,5,"Take the Money and Run is the funniest movie ever made bar none. I suggest you watch it by yourself so that you will view it objectively. Woody Allen understands that to create humor you have to have an element of seriousness. The narration of Jackson Beck provides the element of seriousness. Beck makes it seem like a serious documentary but what is happening on the screen is wholly other. Therein lies the humor for this movie. My favorite scenes are the misspelled note for the bank robbery, the car in the house in an attempt to kill Miss Blair, and the entire chain gang sequence. It came out in 1969, not 1975."
3635,764003828,5,"A brilliant mock-documentary on the life of a criminal - played by
Allen - with some of the funniest lines and sight gags I've ever seen
in a film. It's important to remember that 'mockumentaries' weren't
common when Allen made this, and it was actually seen as quite
experimental in it's own crazy, low budget way.

This isn't the deep, brilliant film-maker of 'Annie Hall', etc, but an
amazingly smart and funny young Allen capturing the spirit of cinema
anarchists like the Marx Brothers.

The only small drawbacks; a sometimes cloying musical score and a
couple of slow sections around the love story. But these are very small
flies in the great ointment.

A minor point - there's a some debate as to whether the correct aspect ratio is 1:66
or 1:85. From what research I could do (as well as old fading memories of seeing the
film in theaters) I think 1:66 is actually correct.

I believe this release is in 1:85, whereas the out of print, but still often available used
Anchor Bay is in 1:66. Probably not a life or death difference, but worth noting
for purists (like me)."
3636,764003828,2,"The DVD of Woody Allen's film ""Take the Money and Run"" was accessible on our computer, but it would NOT run on our TV.  This was a great disappointment."
3637,764003828,1,"I did not know ""widescreen"" meant digitally stretching (distorting) the film. I hope the artist Woody Allen never sees this thing. It is a disgrace to do such a thing to a wonderful film."
3638,764003828,3,"Very dated (late '60's type of humor) but still worth watching if you absolutely love Woody Allen's sense of comedy and his self-loathing study in cinematic pathos. I purchased a used copy and don't feel cheated. Perhaps a Woody Allen diehard fan's must have, but for the average person, this might be one of those you don't really need to own - or view. I watched it expecting more, but realized I've become overly sophisticated in my appreciation for comedy over the last four decades.  It's paced like a television movie-of-the-week, and there are long pauses throughout. The narrative theme is 40's years pass, but interesting for anyone who remembers ""Tenspeed and Brownshoe"" growing up..."
3639,764003828,5,If you enjoy comedy this movie will surely fit the bill. Woody Allen is excellent in the comedic adventure of a bumbling criminal. This is a must have collectable.
3640,764004581,4,"""Hell In The Pacific"" is unusual, interesting and well worth seeing. This is a two person drama set on a Pacific island during World War II.  Toshiro Mifune and Lee Marvin each bring unique acting skills to their roles. Wow! What an ending! I will watch this again, for sure."
3641,764004581,4,"The Bottom Line:

One of the few films I can name with only two actors, Hell in the Pacific takes two of the world's most forceful actors (Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune) and casts them as enemies stranded on the same island in the Pacific with no idea of the other's language; something like the Twilight Zone episode ""Two"" without the romance, Hell in the Pacific is an interesting and unique film."
3642,764004581,5,"This was an awesome movie. I'd seen it years ago, but after reading a friend's grandfather's memoir about Iwo Jima, I had to see it again. Did you know that Lee Marvin was at Iwo Jima and won a highly decorated award? He did! My friend's memoir is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walking-Through-Fire-An-Iwo-Jima-Survivor-s-Remembrance/dp/1932172319/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walking Through Fire, An Iwo Jima Survivor's Remembrance</a>"
3643,764004581,4,Two enemies are trapped on a island together! There are only two actors in this film but it is one of my top films for Japan WW2. By using the subtitles you will understand the Japanese dialogue. This movie keeps you glued to the screen until the last moment. The ending is sudden and I didn't think it fit until I watched it again. There is also a Alternate Ending on the DVD.
3644,764004581,4,"I greatly enjoyed 'Hell in the Pacific' and it was more than I expected. I watched this movie the other night and got a lot out of it.

It's a very involving story set during WWII about an American pilot (the great Lee Marvin) and his Japanese counterpart (the equally great Toshiro Mifune) at odds with each other after they are both unknowingly stranded on the same small, uninhabited island in the vast South Pacific Ocean. They fight and quarrel for a good first half of the movie, but ------ realizing that they are both going to have to rely on the other to get out of their situation or to even survive ------ they gradually form an uneasy alliance.

I thoroughly appreciated John Boorman's obvious commitment to realism on this movie. As the film opens up, it just jumps into the story right away, beginning immediately with the image of Toshiro Mifune sitting alone near the beach and Lee Marvin in the jungle, likely just recently dropped in by parachute. The movie wastes no time with set-up or any explanation as to how they both got there. We don't know and don't need to. The editing is done at a smooth, flowing, non-hurried pace which gives the movie a definite real-time feel to it. The scenery and cinematography of the authentic Palau locations is simply stunning and I'm rather amazed by how good this movie looks for its age. The picture quality and clarity of this film is jaw-dropping for a 40 year-old movie.
The performances from the sole two actors in the entire film are passionate, inspired and thoroughly believable. The setting and plot is almost enough to make one forget for a moment that the two are sworn wartime enemies and we almost immediately empathize with both characters.

There are no subtitles. It puts us more inside the two's struggle since neither can understand what the other is saying. Even though those of us who don't speak Japanese can't understand what Toshiro Mifune's character is saying, we know EXACTLY what he is feeling and thinking through actions, body language, and forcefulness of expression. Watch for the scene when Toshiro Mifune's character catches a real, giant clam and proceeds to crack it open to get to the real, soft mollusk inside just for the sake of a meal. After they are finally able to put aside their differences for the sake of their mutual survival, they collaborate to build a rather impressive wooden and bamboo raft to escape the confines of the island.

My only grievance with this movie was its ending. I will not spoil it, but I will say that I did feel it was inconclusive and didn't provide me with adequate closure for the two characters' ultimate fates. Even the alternate ending still left me feeling a bit unfulfilled but I will leave it up to each individual viewer to decide for themself. The ending just didn't quite work for me and was the only element that prevented me from giving this film the full five stars.

Overall though, this is still an excellent and vastly underrated 1968 gem from one of the best directors of all time, John Boorman. A unique cinematic experience in the fact that it features two prolific, unparalled actors each playing anonymous characters who are the only two in the entire movie in such a huge, isolated setting. A fasinating encapsulation of a very human story set against the backdrop of the WWII-era campaign in the Pacific.

17 years later in 1985, this film would be reimagined with a science-fiction twist as 'Enemy Mine'."
3645,764004581,4,"I find Boorman's direction to be fantastic. As others note two military officers from opposite sides recognize each other. Mifune especially seeks with all his cunning to kill Marvin while the latter struggles very hard just to fill his canteen with drinking water. The tensions, very strong at the beginning slowly dissipate as both realize taking out each
other might be very difficult but via cooperation--even despite the language barriers--two heads can equal the results of three. Mifune shows
his tenderness first. But both play outstanding roles. While trying to develop the peace, Marvin reads a military manual that mandates troops always to kill the enemy.  Their keen attention to the nonverbals, even as both seem not to be observing is a case study for those intererested
in interpersonal communication.  Marvin brings in new vitality once he
recognizes there is bamboo on the island.  Yielding to each other in
a collaborative manner, the raft is built and launched.  Then I got the impression they had to fight high waves without food on the ocean for perhaps four days. Both are exhausted. Discovering the new island is a
dream, that neither perhaps thought would occur.  They forage through
the deserted military hospital, each finding things of special interest  and then dressed neatly as military professionals toast each other
countlessly with a big bottle of booze.  I wasn't ready for the end but
tried to foresee possibilities.  For those who can take a movie with very
limited dialogue, scores of nonverbals and two superb actors, this movie
is a must. Those who enjoy more group drama or romantic entertainment would be bored.  I am glad to have found this movie in my collection. The VHS version plays very well."
3646,764004581,4,"this is the JOHN BOORMAN i love . the director of ""DELIVERANCE"" and ""THE EMERALD FOREST"" in addition to this excellent and haunting film . in his twin outstanding lead actors , a very thoughtful screenplay and breathtaking photography and direction , it all comes together for me . i withhold the fifth star as i am conflicted about the ending . that was john's artistic choice though . i don't do alternate endings ."
3647,764004581,4,"Anyone who wants to make a film would be served well to watch this movie, repeatedly.  Boorman achieves what few filmmakers ever dare: an almost nonverbal story about rivals who learn, somewhat reluctantly, that the humanity they share cannot be abandoned.  Yes, it's a product of the 70's, and the visual style embraces that, but the acting is superb.  These were two of the best actors of their generation, and the collaboration must have been an actor's dream for both.  No more spoilers.  If you're a fan of Boorman, Mifune or Marvin, enjoy."
3648,764004581,4,"This is both a serious movie and a parable.  Toshir Mifune plays Captain Tsuruhiko
Kuroda, a proud Japanese Naval officer and Lee Marvin plays a downed American Pilot.  They both end up on a deserted small island.  They are mortal enemies, but somehow when you are both staring death in the face, it is easier to make common cause against it.  The story of the movie is how they overcome their hatred for each other (in the generic - wartime sense) to find a way to be found, signal for help, or get off the island somehow, someway.  Both actors are superb.

The parable is appropriate for a world ravaged by two-world wars the previous sixty years and now facing nuclear annihilation.  We need to pull together or we will die at each other's through for no good reason.  While I don't want to reveal what happens, it is instructive how vanishing cooperation and friendship are once the immediate threat seems to be past.

As I watched the movie, I could see how the Cast Away  and Enemy Mine both seemed to learn and use things from this film.

I think it is a pretty good film that should be seen yet today.

3649,764004581,4,"In real life, Lee Marvin is a Marine that received a purple heart after being shot in the buttox during the battle for Saipan. Now here he is afterwards making movies where he is confronting his adversary and being the representative for the American side of the WWII GI psyche. His opposite is a Japanese soldier who equally does a splendid job to bring one up to speed with his culture. Both different and somehow the same. United together by a common goal of survival, yet on a hair trigger to let their warrior spirit flare. Interesting concept for a movie. Well done, appropriately cast."
3650,764003828,1,Was disappointed when DVD arrived in the mail as it would not play on my player because of area code.
3651,764003828,4,"Except for a few brief love scenes, this is a fairly good movie to watch with kids from 6 and up.  There are lots of big laughs and obvious physical comedy and lots of other more subtle turns.  The actual bank hold-up is a classic scene, as is the escape of the prison gang.  This version could be watched in Korean with subtitles, but just set it to English without subtitles and enjoy."
3652,764003828,3,"For a 60's era movie, this is funny, hip, daring, topical, and satirical...traits that are commonplace today but not that common when this daring film was made.

One of the reasons that I'm not a fan of Woody Allen (besides that the sicko impregnated his adopted daughter) is that I don't appreciate the whole nebbishy, neurotic, lack of physicality,  Jewish stereotype. I'm Jewish (albeit a ""big"" Jew)  and that persona does nobody any good.

However, in 1969, when this movie was made, that negative caricature, was not really utilized in the movies. Taking that stereotype and coupling it with that of a ruthless and bold criminal was unique. The notion that the viewer saw the caricature as always failing, yet the charactor himself did not perceive himself that way, was a refreshing way of telling a story. The story and narrative was so odd that I find the movie [still] refreshingly funny.

Favorite scene...when Virgil is frisked at the prison and cracks up because he's ticklish."
3653,764003828,5,"Woody Allen's directorial debut, and it's still funnier than many of his later movies.  You know, he tended toward introspection over comedy in later years.  At the time I ordered, this import was the only widescreen version (zone 0) available in north america.  Sure, it has some korean styled packaging, but you still get english audio and subtitles.  The movie itself is is fresh comedy from a guy making a funny movie, not a commercial movie.  Beware, this movie contains prison scenes and carved soap."
3654,764003828,5,"Take the Money and Run is a very funny Woody Allen comedy released in 1969 between What's Up Tiger Lily? and Bananas. This excellent Korean transfer is the only widescreen version of the film available. There are some extra features available if your Korean is better than mine (non-existent).
If you liked Sleeper and Love and Death, Allen's best early comedies, you will like this one."
3655,764003828,2,"This ABC VIDEO tape of Woody Allen's TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN (1969) seems suspect. Although the back cover says it's a licensed product, I can't imagine why FOX would allow a company to sell really BAD copies of any of their catalogue.

Further, ABC VIDEO is not affiliated with PARAMOUNT.

The tape tracks well and has good HiFi audio, but it's all downhill from there. Recorded at the slowest speed, it's got a blurry picture that over-saturates with color.

3658,764003828,5,"There is no one better than Woody to portray a schmuck. This poor shlep could not do anything right no matter what. I love Ms. Margolin and her untimely demise is heart breaking. That last scene when he asked ""Do you know if it's raining"" classic Woody."
3659,764004581,5,"Mifune Toshiro once said of himself that he was only a great actor when being directed by Kurosawa.  It is undeniably true.  However, he was always a good actor, and even though only Kurosawa could pull the greatness from him, any Mifune performance is worth checking out.  His American-directed attempts are usually even poorer than his quickly-done super-samurai slugfests, but ""Hell in the Pacific"" is an exception to the rule.  This is good stuff.

The story is not exactly innovative.  It was done four years earlier in the Frank Sinatra flick,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/None-But-the-Brave/dp/B00143XE0U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">None But the Brave</a>, which was also a Japanese-American collaboration.  However, whereas Sinatra had an entire platoon to back him up when making a tentative truce with the stranded Japanese castaways, in ""Hell in the Pacific"" there are only two, Lee Marvin and Mifune Toshiro.  Lost on an unpopulated island, the two enemies must first fight, then carve out a grudging respect as they realize the desperateness of their plight, and how little wars mean when there are only two people in existence.

This is a brave and innovative film.  Marvin and Mifune are the only two actors, and everything was filmed on location.  There are no mourning wives waiting for a hopeful return, no platoon of buddies still out looking, no volleyball sidekick.  We aren't even entirely sure how they both arrived there.  None of Mifune's lines are subtitled, so the frustration of communication is powerful, both for the viewer and for Marvin's character.  However, for such a sparse movie, director John Boorman is innovative in his use of location and props to suggestive a broader world.

The ending of ""Hell in the Pacific"" is a story in and of itself.  There are two versions.  One, demanded by US audiences, is a ""happy ending"", although ambiguously so.  The other ending, released for overseas audiences such as the UK and Japan, is explosive to say the least, and far bleaker.  Because of the wonderful nature of DVDs, both endings are included, and you can choose the fate you want for the two characters."

 Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune (The BEST Japanese actor ever), are the perfect team for this unforgettable war story from WW2! An American and a Japanese soldiers are stranded on an isolated island... they are enemies, trying to survive each other, the nature, the isolation from human beings. This movie wakes up all the feelings, that a man can feel- love,fear, pity, anger, compassion, sadness, happiness..., hate- one moment you hate Toshiro's character, then you hate Lee's... ""It's only the two of you, why can't you just live and let live, forgive..."" Very intense,like a roller coaster ride. I saw it as a kid and never forgot it, and at last I was able to find it and GET IT FOR MY OWN MOVIE GALLERY! This movie is priceless and never gets old. And it is too short! You, Lee and Toshiro fighting for survival- you feel this intense movie is over before it even began!
 Aulikki"
3662,764004581,5,"I'm one of the big fan of Mifune. He is the first and last big Japanese actor approved in the world, I think. And also, Lee Marvin is one of my favourite US actors. These two big in Japan and US in one film. I think we never miss it..."

3664,764004581,5,"Watch it English,then in Japanese with Subtitles.  Well done acting and visuals. There is a lot here. Meaningful to all."
3665,764004581,4,"For a 1968 Hollywood-bankrolled war movie, HELL IN THE PACIFIC was almost right up there with the best of ""foreign"" films of the Sixties. Featuring only two characters throughout---a Japanese officer and an American officer marooned together on a otherwise unpopulated Pacific island in 1944---the film puts us immediately into the difficulties facing the two men, who are enemies by their circumstances and literally cannot understand each other. The story of how they deal with their plight unfolds in ways that make perfect sense, and both Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune as the two exiles give performances that are both believable and affecting. In fact, the only thing that keeps this from being a five-star movie for me is the very end, which, as I suspected, was grafted on at the behest of the studio heads [cf, director John Boorman's autobiography, ADVENTURES OF A SUBURBAN BOY]. The original ending, included on this DVD release as a special feature, makes much more sense and would have been better. But up until then you're watching one of the best war movies ever made."
3666,764004581,4,"This is a quirkey and unique little movie. Definitely not perfect, but different, rewarding, and thought prevoking on several levels. I am not a Lee Marvin fan but I thought he and Toshiro Mifune did an excellent out-of-the-box acting job in this movie. If you liked the  ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"" movies you will probably like ""Hell in the Pacific""."
3667,764004581,1,"As a talented actor, Toshiro Mifune portrays his roles more definitively as a Japanes Samurai or SHOGUN, not a stranded soldier on an island.

In comparison to his other films, I found Hell in the Pacific to be quite boring. I can cleary understand the dialogue between Lee Marvin and Mifune yet the film could have pumped up a notch with at least a shred of Budo action from Mifune. Its evident from their first encounter on the beach that Mifune's raw talent could have produced a dramtic fight scene but they are left standing there, fiercely gazing at one another with no climax.

Chanbara films of today are far more entertaining and not conservative like Hell in the Pacific. I recommend ""Seven Samurai""."
3668,764004581,3,"HELL IN THE PACIFIC is a curiosity.  Telling the story of two pilots, one Japanese (Toshiro Mifune) and one American (Lee Marvin), stranded on a small, deserted tropical island during World War II it's at once fascinating and somewhat flat.  Mifune and Marvin are two of my favorite actors.  Their plight on the island, coveting or guarding precious limited resources against the `enemy', more or less drives home the point that war is a futile exercise.  Of course the question arises as to whether we can conquer our distrust before we conquer, or are conquered by, our enemy.  HELL IN THE PACIFIC is thought-provoking and beautifully photographed by master cinematographer Conrad Hall.

  After a while, though, with all the attacks and counter-attacks, I got the feeling that I was in the middle of a Road Runner cartoon with no exit.  This feeling was exacerbated by such scenes as Marvin trying to teach captive Mifune (the balance of power changes a number of times) to fetch a stick like a dog.  It was an ill-conceived scene, brutishly funny if the intent was humor, but added onto the ridiculous ending HELL IN THE PACIFIC seems to have expended its creative energy well before the final credits run.  By the way, I strongly recommend watching the `Alternate Ending' in the Special Features after watching the movie.  It's the right ending for the movie, and it's a mystery why it's the `alternate' one."
3669,764004581,3,"Similiarities to the Enemy Mine movie could be made here. Perhaps the Enemy Mine writer got the idea from this story. Two men stranded on a Island rather than a planet in this case. As WWII rages a Japanese and American soldier are stranded on the same small island. They try to kill each other at first. As time goes by they realize their very survival depends on a truce. Eventually they work together and build a raft. After days on the Pacific Ocean they find another larger group of islands. The uneasy truce becomes shaky again when they find remnants of Japanese and American occupation on the main island. Up to this point an excellent movie. In fact I was say close to flawless movie since the acting, sets, scenery, music, directing and all the rest are incredible. SPOILER ALERT: Now the reason I didn't give it four or five stars is because they kill them off with a single stray artillery shell in the original ending. You will be enthralled with the wonderful acting and really care for these two characters. Then to suddenly watch their lifes snuffed out just so some writer or director could make their point that war is bad didn't impress me. If someone didn't think we get that point long before the ending of this movie, they don't give much credit to the audience. Why they didn't use the alternate ending with the soldiers walking off their separate ways is beyond me. Be sure to look at the alternate ending and see if you agree this should have been the original ending. Still well worth owning."
3670,764004581,4,"I am surprised that this movie is not more well known. I just happened to borrow a copy on VHS from my aunt, and the movie simply blew my mind. It shows another side of WW2 and really blasts apart the stereotypes of the Japanese soldier portrayed in American propaganda films and also the American soldier as many Japanese were led to believe. The movie pretty much goes like this : Lee Marvin crashes into the ocean somewhere in the pacific and ends up on an island with the enemy, a Japanese soldier. Their fears and angers are played out as they both struggle to capture one another. They fight back and forth and also play mind games with one another in order to gain the upper hand. Finally, they learn that in order to survive they must put aside their animosity and work together. They slowly become friends and grow to trust one another and work together to build a small raft to escape the island. The Cinematography and acting in the movie are top notch, the only complaint I have was the original ending, but I have heard the DVD comes with alternate endings. I was also pleasantly surprised that John Boorman directed this film. SEE THIS MOVIE!"
3671,764004581,4,"My fiance got me the DVD as a present to me on his birthday.  It sat for a month and then we finally watched it together.  I was amazed that there was no dialogue... really.  Very little.  And when we were watching the DVD, we did not choose the option for subtitles and only realized that option after we'd seen the film.  Overall it is a film to watch -- really watch.  After you see it once without the subtitles, watch it again with them.  Makes it a totally different experience.  The acting and directing is incredible and one is left wondering, what the screenplay of this film actually looked like.  Not too many special features but there is an alternate ending that is interesting."
3672,764004581,5,"This is in my top 10 of all time.
I watched this movie - heres what blew me away.
1. minimal use of soundtrack - breathing of the actors is enough to convey thirst, fear, hate - I cant tell you how much I appreciated the nuances - something lost in todays movies - which is why this stands from the pack
2. minimal script - words fail to tell the story
3. cinematography - artistically right on
4. character studies - of characters that are believable and interesting. I did not find find Marvins character to be any less so than Mifunes. Marvin played the stereotype well and so did Mifune. Characteristics are nuanced as well.
5. alternative ending was very satisfying - in reality the alternative ending would have been more likely."
3673,764004581,4,"Lee Marvin... a war veteran for real, so when Boorman decided to make him an even bigger star than he already was, he knew he was dealing with iconic material that needed to contrast with an equally fiery temper of a quite different kind. So he put another icon from the east opposite him, the king of the Samurai films, and made his first subversive feature. Hey, where else do you get to see Lee Marvin take a leak on Toshiro Mifune's head? Not in any other American cinema of the period, that's for sure!
This should've been the war movie to end all war movies, because it just lays the whole absurdity out in such a hilarious laboratory test of extremes, no one who sees it ever forgets its almost ""Naked and the Dead"" type absurdist, thoroughly anti-war point of view, which is effective ONLY BECAUSE it makes the existence of evil an undeniable fact that needs to be checked and transcended by humans ALL THE TIME.
Fans of idiotic, pointless 'WAR' dramas that senimentalize the 'mettle-testing' horrifically absurd experience called by that neanderthal-grunt-friendly three letter word into some kind of 'heroism' to justify the 'freedom-saving' lunacy for the poor dupes who went through it (the fantastically crafted but artistically mediocre ""Saving Private Ryan,"" for one) need not apply, but anyone else looking for confrontational cinema in the humans-shooting-projectiles-at-other-humans-wearing-different-clothes genre would do well to start with ""Hell in the Pacific,"" then move on to Anthony Mann's ""Men in War,"" Sam Fuller's ""Steel Helmet,"" and Bertrand Tavernier's ""Capitaine Conan.""  Peace Out Y'all, and remember to solve all your peace-time problems with a gun, as Tony Soprano would."
3674,764004581,5,"Being a hardcore fan of movies from Japan and China, Hell in the pacific is one of the few American arthouse movies I now owned and it is an absolutely fantastic piece of work.
Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune is absolutely terrific in this movie. Their chemistry is as perfect as the story is tense and an absolutely hilarious esp during the scenes when they try to out do each other in their ""turf fight"". I crack up everytime each one of them mess up their  own dirty little wicked plan in the most humourous fashion.
The cinematography is stunning and I really appreciate the alternate ending. I find the original ending really sucks big time.
Still a solid 5 star for this movie. 2 stars for both actors, 1 star for the movie, 1 star for the cinematography and 1 star for the alternate ending. There you go, a 5 star pure cinematic genius. I am very very happy with this DVD."
3675,764004581,5,"Hell In The Pacific is one of the most excellent films of our times. Truly showing the eternal search for peace, yet with the first encounter with the globalization machine, the media, and propaganda, this is shattered."
3676,764004581,4,"""Hell in the Pacific"" is a fairly early film in the career of  John Boorman, a sort of stealth director whose name rarely occurs to you  right away as one of the greats but who has done excellent work over many  decades.  ""Deliverance"" was four years off, ""Excalibur""  and ""Hope and Glory"" further out, and the clean and sharp  ""The General"" a full three decades away.
Lee Marvin is an  American pilot washed up on the shore of a small Pacific island in the  waning days of World War II -- only to find the one other inhabitant is a  Japanese officer played by the awesome Toshiro Mifune.  Although they carry  on the larger war between them for a time, they gradually realize the only  way either is going to survive and get off the island is if they work  together. But can they do it?
Mifune's dialogue is all in Japanese and  not subtitled, so he is as mysterious and threatening to the viewer as he  is to the Marvin character, but we can tell by his actions, self-built  fortifications, and survival schemes that he's a smarter, more disciplined  man than the American. For a time, all the Marvin character can think to do  is pick away at the former's elaborate survival arrangements, and there is  quite a bit of humor in that.
Leonard Maltin and the other Amazon  reviewers complain about the ending, which comes as an abrupt and  dissatisfying shock, but I think it offers the viewer a choice of  interpretations. It could be taken straight, as the objective fate of our  two heroes, or it could suggest a metaphor for their (and our) inability to  get along together, an image of humanity's potential ultimate fate --  something more in the characters' heads than on the ground....
Anyway, a  fine, tight little movie."
3677,764004581,4,Although it may not have been the BEST ending to this otherwise fascinating look at the humanity of war. Nonetheless this is a very enjoyable and intriging look at an awkward turn of events for two enemies forced to confront their foe on solitary terms. The ending was war itself.  Irony. Tragedy. Ending.
3678,764003828,3,"Allen's first film as director, not the one of his best, but a good start to his brilliant career. All charasteristics of his ego are here seeding. After this about one movie a year which is pretty incredible. I hope he keeps going."
3679,764003828,3,"This is a great Woody Allen film.
However, it is only 85 minutes long, just like every other release.
The description claims uncut 91 minute version. There is no extra material.

It is widescreen, but I have to compare it side-by-side with a VHS version to acertain if making it widescreen cuts off the bottom and top of the picture.
All special features are only written text and only in Korean, so virtually no special features unless you read Korean.

Don't buy this because the description claims uncut version.
It is not.
It is, however, a really funny Woody film! Buy any domestic release."
3680,764003828,4,"The Bottom Line:

A free-wheeling comedy by Allen, made before Annie Hall ushered in his more serious phase, Take the Money and Run offers a lot of laughs in a short period of time; its humor is not always sophisticated, but it should crack you up quite a bit."
3681,764003828,2,"Probably the least funny of the old Woody Allen films that I've been re-visiting.  Although I really did like the scene where he is given an experimental vaccine and suffers the unusual, ""Side effects of turning into a rabbi for several hours."""
3682,764003828,5,"I can't stop laughing whenever I remember this movie. Have seen it dubbed in Persian language too and it was even more hilarious. Though I was curious to see the actual English language version and it was even funnier. gosh, this guy is brilliant. Loved it.... I think Woody Allen is a neurotic comedian and this work of him is among the best comedies I have seen. Good job 5/5"
3683,764003828,5,"Told in a documentary style complete with voiceover and ""interviews,"" Take the Money and Run is a hilarious play-by-play of the life of a hardened criminal named Virgil Starkwell (Woody Allen). From the day he was born, he devoted his life to crime from the beginning when he knocked off bubblegum machines to his later years when he attempted several bank robberies. Unfortunately, although Virgil was inventive, he was hardly smooth and all of his attempts ended in failure with his glasses smashed on the sidewalk. One good thing happened to him, though; he met a pretty girl (Janet Margolin) and fell in love.

This hilarious film has lost none of its punch over the years. There are so many memorable scenes and great running gags. The humor is still fresh and interesting, but the style blends well with modern comedy. Although Allen has moved away from this style in his more modern films, his early work appeals to younger audiences. This was the first time he wrote, directed, and starred in a film, a trend that would continue for years afterward."
3684,764003828,5,"This is a hilarious, slapstick gem. It has some of Allen's best lines, a few incredibly entertaining situations and is one of his funniest comedies. This is a very funny movie, strongly recommended.

3685,764003828,1,"I wouldn't call myself a Woody Allen fan but I thought this film was simply hilarious and most of the jokes and gags hold up well even today and if you like off-beat humour ala ""There's Something About Mary"" or even ""Saturday Night Live"" you will find a lot to like about this film.  The jokes come thick and fast and although not all of them score, the vast majority of them do making it a comedy that rewards repeated viewing.

The only problem is with the dvd which is not restored in any way and so the picture and sound quality really suffer in comparison with what's currently out there.  There are no special features of note either.  This film is certainly one of the funniest and most enjoyable that I've ever seen but my advice is to wait for the Blu-ray version that significantly restores the picture quality as well as adds good special features and has good audio options such as at a minimum a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround option to do justice to your home theatre system."
3686,764003828,5,"Take The Money And Run is the first movie Woody Allen ever wrote, directed and starred in all at once. Even early on in his film career, Woody Allen shows genius and promise to grow much, much further than most artists ever go. The film's plot moves along at a good pace and the acting increases the quality of the movie--and the jokes.

The film, as you may well know, is a spoof of documentaries called a ""mockumentary."" The film purports to show the life and times of a petty criminal named Virgil Starkwell (Woody Allen). We see him being bullied by his childhood peers on the streets and his failure at playing the cello signals his failure to become a successful criminal.

The film is essentially one gag after another in rapid fire. We see Virgil fail at bank robbery after bank robbery; perhaps the funniest is when Virgil and his buddies try to rob a bank when another gang wants to rob the same bank on the same day. We also see Virgil fall in love with beautiful Louise (Janet Margolin). Janet plays Louise with a great deal of realism and her matter-of fact attitude toward Virgil's bank robbing is comical as well.

In order to make Take The Money And Run feel even more like a documentary, we get ""interviews"" with Virgil's parents (who wear Groucho Marx glasses to disguise themselves) and teachers and acquaintances who knew Virgil. The acting is excellent.

The DVD doesn't offer too many extras but the movie is so well done that I will give this a five star rating anyway.

Take The Money And Run is sure to give you a laugh--in fact, you'll be laughing all the way. The ""mockumentary"" style of the film enhances its comedic effect. I highly recommend this film for people who enjoy comedy films and fans of Woody Allen."
3687,764003828,5,"When the history of 20th century comedy is written, someone will tell the story of the geniuses who emerged from the working class neighborhoods of New York's outer boroughs: Queens, the Bronx, and Brooklyn. Neil Simon will make the list, along with Mel Brooks, and Woody Allen. There are others, of course. Together they make up one of the most remarkable flowerings of comic talent in American history. Woody's talent sprang from him fully formed. His basic gift is in full evidence in this early picture. It is debatable that he has improved with age, although it is worth noting that his exposure, like Harold Pinter's, to elegant, bourgeois life permanently altered the objects of his comic study. Mia Farrow introduced him to the good life, to aristocratic penthouse life, and there was no turning back. Still, his genius can be seen in his ability to adjust and move on. Later Woody is every bit as good as his early work, but not necessarily better, unless you happen to like posh talk and that very special boredom of the urban bourgeoisie. This early picture, though lacking in elegant settings and posh-talk, is vintage; here we having that wonderful skewering of pieties that one remembers from the Marx Brothers. Woody is wonderful at exposing pretensions, great and small. Here he plays a small-time hoodlum, a kind of Sylvester Stallone, played as a clumsy oaf, a loser, and nebbishy klutz, with eyes for the gals. Groucho, where are you? The film is a work of genius. It is a jewel."
3688,764003828,5,"Excellent, witty, vintage Woody Allen, and I am so pleased it is released in full screen.  Widescreen versions add nothing to films, and people who feel that they do are pompous cinema snobs.  Rather than look at two black lines on my 42"" flat screen HDTV, I like the films up close and personal.  I would much rather see people's faces and the little details of a scene than the booring, blurred panorama.  For the vast majority of films, it is the faces and expressions of the protagonists that are of interest, not the apes and monkeys in the background."
3689,764003828,5,"Watching this movie almost 40 years after it came out cannot capture how irreverent it felt in 1969.  The world has become so much cruder and the language so much more coarse that this feels much like a family film today.  It is funny, yes, but some of it feels dated.  Comedy is often tied to its time and doesn't travel to a later time so well.  Yet, much of the movie remains terrific and classic.  There are many lines that have become part of the language (""it is if you're doing it right"", for example).  Just go up to anyone who knows the film and say ""abt natural"" or ""I have a gub"" and they will likely begin to chuckle.  And, of course, there is the soap and shoe polish gun in the rain.

It is also nice to see Janet Margolin in one of her best roles as the female lead, Louise, Virgil's eternally loyal girlfriend.  She was taken far too young by ovarian cancer, but this role is a great one to remember her by.

For those who haven't seen the movie, Woody Allen plays Virgil Starkwell, a really down and out kid, what is a nerd called if they are also stupid?  That's Virgil.  He loves playing the cello, but without the least spark of talent.  He tries to play the cello in a marching band.  He turns to crime with even less ability than he has for the cello.  Of course, like all stupid people, he gets himself into worse trouble because he actually thinks he knows what he is doing.  However, he is also aware that nothing works out for him, but thinks it is basically bad breaks even though he understands he has no abilities whatsoever.  That mix of self-awareness and yet being completely unaware is the source of much of the humor.  It really does work and is quite funny.

3690,764003828,4,"This is one of the funniest Woody Allen films. I don't know why it was released in full screen and that is why I deduct one star. One of Woody's less complex comedies, but still one of my favorites. The DVD transfer looks good, but a widescreen version should have been included."
3691,764003828,4,"Woody Allen has a delightful way of seeing the ridiculous, the silly, the ambiguous side of life and portrays it perfectly in his many movies.  Take the Money and Run was one of his earlier movies and I laugh every time I watch it."
3692,764003828,4,"Woody Allen stars and directs for the first time, and what a success it turns out to be. There are many great sight gags as well as the usual number of quality one-liners. The film is done in a documentary style, telling the story of Virgil Starkwell, an incompentent petty criminal, played by Woody of course.

To pick a favourite moment out is difficult. However, if forced to pick one I'd go for the scene where Virgil tries to rob a bank, and fails because he hands over a note where the word gun can easily be mistaken for gub. Consequently the entire bank staff and customers are all arguing whether the word is gun or gub. Woody insists its gun; everybody else thinks its gub...

This is definitely one of Woody's early funny ones!"
3693,764003828,5,"Not bad for Woody Allen in his first movie as star,director and writer! It is outrageously funny from start to finish. Add Jackson Beck's narration and you have the makings for a fun,humorous narration on the life and times of Virgil Starkwell, the mastermind of crime! I thought this was a winner when I first saw it several years ago and it is still funny!"
3694,764003828,3,"This is an early film (his first) of comedian /actor/director Woody Allen starring himself in the lead as Virgil Starkwell a bungling wannabe bank robber whose hijinks land him in prisons, in bed with a lovely girl and the halls of academia as an expert on crime. In this film we can see the outlines of Woody's seemingly endless love affair with early black and white crime and film noir classics. There is a little more use of sight gags here than in latter films but through it all Woody is still the funny bumbling New York Jewish kid that a long series of films will explore in greater detail. The use of an old time newsreel announcer to describe and set the framework of the film and detail the action is an interesting twist. Not the best Woody Allen film but a good look at the niche that he created for himself in American urban comedy/ social commentary cinema."
3695,764003828,5,"Presented as a mock documentary complete with narration by radio ham Jackson Beck, Allen's hilarious directorial debut is nuttier and loaded with more gags than his later, more sophisticated New York films. But that's exactly why it works: The laughs are goofy and often puerile, and for all the zippy one-liners that don't quite elicit a full-belly guffaw, Allen piles on with cutting satire (focused mostly on footage of presidents Nixon and Eisenhower). You'll have a lot of fun watching this manic genius at work in one of his earlier comedic efforts."
3696,764003828,4,"Take the Money and Run, is a film hilarius and funny. Woody Allen in the great moment."
3697,764003828,5,Very funny for Woody's first full length feature.  He's an incompetant bank robber and his wife is a laundress.  Enjoy!
3698,764003828,3,"Long before Christopher Guest mastered the genre, Woody Allen made a comic mockumentary of the life of a failed bank robber named Virgil Starkwell complete with newsreel footage, excerpts from interviews with people in his life (including his embarrassed parents in Groucho Marx masks) and a stentorian voiceover narration by Jackson Beck. This fitfully funny 1969 comedy marks Allen's feature film debut as a triple threat - director, writer (with early partner Mickey Rose) and star, and it shows the earmarks of his later visual style even if the laughs are not always there.

Lacking an actual storyline, the movie takes us through Starkwell's life from shoplifting bubblegum machines as a youngster to bank robberies to finding the ideal woman to prison and so on and so on. This is Allen at his purest with focus on often hilarious sight gags and self-deprecating one-liners without his later forays into the complexities of the human condition. In fact, this is probably the only time that Allen has played a screen character without any intellectual pretensions. The closest he comes is pretending to be a cellist with the Philharmonic to the girl of his dreams, a pretty laundress named Louise. The best gags are probably the prison shirt-folding machine, the bank robbery where Starkwell's badly handwritten note is passed around the staff to interpret, the escaped chain gang coming into the old woman's house, the prison vaccine experiment that turns Starkwell into a Hassidic rabbi, and my favorite, the totally impossible scene where he drives a car inside a blackmailing woman's house chasing her around.

Of less interest is the romance between Starkwell and Louise, who is portrayed as self-conscious and rather mealy-mouthed. Allen's usual generosity with actresses has not yet developed at this point, and Janet Margolin is forced to play Louise quite passively despite her beauty. For a movie that is supposed to take place between the 1940's through the early 1960's, it certainly looks and feels like hippie-era 1969, especially with the Austin Powers-style music over the chase scenes. Allen's first wife Louise Lasser (yes, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman) has a funny cameo as an early girlfriend. There are no extras with the 2004 MGM DVD package."
3699,764003828,3,"This early Woody Allen comedy is often quite a bit of fun.  Check out some of the other reviews here, which recount a few of the better sight gags and funny scenarios to see what I mean.  Just be warned, though, that Woody still had a way to go before the jokes got really sharp and the storylines moved with supreme smoothness.  I don't want to overstate the criticism, as ""Take the Money and Run"" never sinks to boredom, or choppiness in the story telling.  It's just that Woody's best period was still three or four films ahead of him at this point and a certain lack of polish is still evident.  But the movie is still definitely worth a look, even though I'm not as big a fan of it as some other folks.

Unfortunately, the full-frame version of ""Take the Money and Run"" is the one most easily available on DVD in this country.  On the plus side, however, I noticed no obvious and offensive cropping of the image while I watched the movie (though I guess something must have been cropped somewhere to create the full-frame image).  Also on the plus side, the print is sharp, clear, and bright.

But, alas, like most DVDs of Woody's films, there are basically no extras, just a trailer.  But we've come to expect that from Mr. Allen, haven't we?  To his credit, the man doesn't like to go on and on about his movies, preferring to let them speak for themselves."

3701,764003828,5,"This film is treated something like the lost child in the canon of director Woody Allen's career.  As if he would have to apologize for this instead of, say, ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"".  What Allen attempted here in his directorial debut is groundbreaking.  This is the first example I can recall of a director telling his film in mock-documentary style, later employed by Albert Brooks and perfected by Christopher Guest.  Allen proves himself to be not only a great comic visualist but there are great verbal puns here as well.  The conceit of the film is a gas.  We're supposed to believe that Allen's Virgil Starkwell, an inept dweeb of a criminal, if not among the FBI's most wanted does cause Mr. Hoover some sleepless nights.  The gags here are rapidfire but I wouldn't spoil it for those who are uninitiated.  My favorite being,though, is Virgil orchestrating a prison break with a gun he's fashioned out of soap during a rainstorm.  All this failed effort leaves him with is a hand full of soap lather.  Also, noteworthy in the cast is the late Janet Margolin as Virgil's faithful wife.  Margolin basically plays straight woman to Allen but it's a shame this gifted actress who was so good in ""David and Lisa"" didn't have a more substantial film career."
3702,764003828,5,"Woody Allen is a great filmmaker who has made some comedies that are also deep character studies (Annie Hall, Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters, etc.). However, there's something to be said for films like What's Up, Tiger Lily, Play it Again, Sam and Sleeper -- films that are just plain funny. Probably the best of these is Take the Money and Run which spoofs the true crime documentaries of the time. Allen plays Virgil Starkwell, a hilariously inept career criminal whose life is one misadventure after another. Using ""testimony"" from people in Starkwell's life and cinema vierte style photography, Allen peppers the audience with hilarious sight gag after sight gag. Among my favorites:

1. In high school, Starkwell joins the marching band ... as a cello player. The image of Allen running up the street with chair and cello in hand, stopping for a moment to play a few bars, then getting up and running a few more feet in hysterically funny.

2. Starkwell invites his girlfriend (played by Janet Margolin of ""David and Lisa"") to dinner but doesn't have the money. He breaks into several parking meters. When he tips the maitre'd, he dumps several dollars in change into his hand and all over the floor.

3. Starkwell robs a bank, but the teller can't read the note he hands him, thinking that the word ""gun"" is ""gub.""

4. When entering prison, one of the guards frisks Starkwell, inducing peals of ticklish laughter.

Indeed, Take the Money and Run seems a lot more like a film by Allen's former colleague on Your Show of Shows, Mel Brooks, than like one of his later films. The story is just a framework for gag after gag -- most of which are unbelievably funny. Allen did some wonderful and deep character studies later in his career, but Take the Money and Run is a hilarious comedy that should stand among his best work."
3703,764003828,5,"`Take the Money and Run' is the very first movie where Woody Allen is writer, director, and star, and true to the first film in any artist's series of work, it may be the his best up to `Annie Hall', his seventh film as writer/director/star and arguably his very best comedy. `Love and Death' and `Bananas' may a little weak. `Play It Again, Sam' has the first writing and direction where the audience develops some empathy with the characters, so it presages the more serious business of the later films. But `Take the Money and Run' is simply nonstop silliness, with some of the longest and best running gags this side of Mel Brooks.

Even this very first movie has many of Allen's trademarks. For a relatively low budget movie, the quality of the music is very, very good, with original pieces contributed by the up and coming Marvin Hamlisch. Even though the supporting cast is not filled with a lot of highly recognizable actors, most of the faces such as the chain gang supervisor all seem to have a vaguely familiar look about them. Allen's female lead is Janet Margolin, for whom this is probably the highlight of her career. His `Bananas' costar, Louise Lasser, later of `Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman' appears in a very small role.

Two other trademark motifs are the flashbacks to boyhood and the cut-aways to interviews with the principle character's parents. These devices appear in `Annie Hall' and even in the relatively serious `Crimes and Misdemeanors' plus several other films.

Another typical aspect of this movie is that it is a parody of documentaries, although not with such loving artfulness as Allen does in `Zelig'.

One thing that is entirely absent is any intellectuality. I can't recall any joke for which you need to read a Russian novel or see a classic silent movie to understand. While it strikes me that poor Virgil Starkwell does have some mock heroic aspects which may have been borrowed from `Don Quixote' or `Candide', I think that may be my seeing things of which Allen had no inkling.

Allen has claimed, contrary to a lot of other artists' statements, that comedy is easy. Allen is so adept in this movie at spinning off high quality jokes at such a rate that he genuinely makes it seem effortless. And yet, like the proverbial Chinese meal, you leave this movie and an hour later, you are `still hungry'. That is, you take away no warm feelings for any characters and their situations or any satisfaction that a hero succeeded in a quest or a heavy got their just deserts.

Some movies have compared Allen's work to the Marx brothers. In the sense that I suspect the Marx brothers have inoculated every American comedian since their heyday, I suppose there is something there. I suggest that W. C. Fields much more directly influences Allen. While the Marx brothers used a great deal of visual humor, Fields was a true poet of the illusion of clumsiness, created with his major skill as a juggler. Allen parodies some of Fields' great moves with a pool cue. While Allen can't hold a candle to Fields' dexterity, the result is still pretty funny.

My primary recommendation for people who may like some but not all of Allen's films, this one should definitely be in your collection, whether you just like his `early, funny' movies or prefer all his styles, but want to skip over some of the darker, less well written, or less interesting works."
3704,764003828,5,"This is one of those movies that Woody has his fans refer to in ""Stardust Memories"", and vicariously in ""Husbands and Wives"", as being early funny work--and funny it is as you'll laugh your way through nearly all of it.  Parts of ""Take the Money and Run"" are as hysterical as ""Sleeper,"" such as the shot where his gun turns to soap suds and when he morphs into a Rabbi.  Also of note is when he poses as a classical musician but can't place the name of Mozart.  This is happy, loose camp in the spirit of the Marx Brothers.  Rent it, buy it, do whatever, you can't go wrong with this one.  It's good clean fun."
3705,764003828,4,"Allen's directorial debut is a joy from beginning to end. By no means does it have the depth and sophistication of his later work, but it's consistently funny, with one gag running into the next, and there are teasing moments of that blur between fantasy and reality that characterized his films.

The story concerns one Virgil Starkwell, a bespectacled failure who resorts to crime for a living, and can't even be a success at that. He tries to stage a bank robbery, but it flops when the tellers start arguing over whether his handwritten note says ""I have a gub"" or ""I have a gun"". It's told partly in a spoof-documentary style that foreshadows Allen's later full-blown mockumentary, Zelig (1983)."
3706,764003828,5,"Woody definitely hit the comedy goldmine here with the story of Virgil Starkwell, World's Most Incompetent Criminal!

Done in a Prison/Heist movie meets Documentary style, Woody Allen and his inspired cast take you for a hilarious ride through the underworld with one hilarious mishap after another coming at you at machine gun pace. Punctuated by a great Marvin Hamlisch score and the authoritative yet clipped over-serious narration of the late Jackson Beck underlining the most absurd and hilarious moments, this is one movie that you just cannot tear yourself away from or stop laughing at and with.

Thrill and howl as you witness Virgil's cello virtuosity (LOL) in a marching band, his attempt to escape a chain gang that results in his imprisonment with an insurance salesman and his attempts at raising a family while on the run.

A comedy classic if ever there was! The Best of THE EARLY FUNNY ONES!"
3707,764003828,5,"This has to be one of the funniest movies ever made. When I first seen it was a Woody Allen movie, I didn't have high expectations. I decided to sit through it anyways. And, to my surprise I actually laughed through most of the entire movie. The documentary type style was the greatest idea. If you love irony this is a great movie to see. Heck, if you love to laugh this is a great movie to see. I give this one a big stamp of approval and I don't do that for many movies"
3708,764003828,5,"I'm a great Woody Allen's fan but I believe he offer us three types of movies. 1. Kind of serious movies 2. Nice comedies with great dialogues and history 3. Hilarious comedies. The last type are my type. If you've seen one of the following listed below, you MUST see the others: Love and Death, Bananas, Take the Money and Run, Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask, Anie Hall, Sleeper, A Midsummer Night's Comedy and Zelig. Garanteed laughs !"
3709,764003828,5,"The counter scene when Allen's character says he is robbing the bank and has a ""gub"".  That is hilarious!! Many more humorous scenes!
One of America's best comics ever!!"
3710,764003828,3,"From around this early time, before Allen truly crystallized his peculiar brand of a nebbish neurotic New York man, I had enjoyed Bananas and Sleeper for their sheer creativity and comic pizzazz. I thought Take the Money and Run would be in a similar league but unfortunately it's not.
A prescient newsreel style voiceover constitutes the narrative device of choice, putting its personal spin on events as it recounts the life of our doozy criminal, Virgil, a nerd turn notorious gangster. It is this wry commentary that lends the film its pseudo-documentary flavor, and the plot is pretty much a patchwork of such clips and thus not exactly awash with consistent humor. Certain scenes are pretty funny though, e.g., the protagonist's escape attempt at the prison that involved a bar of soap and some shoe polish, or a bizarre incident with a chain gang, etc.
For Allen fans, it's a no brainer: you'll see it anyway. For the rest of the viewers, I'd recommend giving other more polished comedies from Allen a try before you get to this erratic early-in-the-game cameo. It simply hasn't stood the test of time."
3711,764003828,4,"Simply put, this movie is hilarious. If you like movies with a bunch of ridiculous (and unexpected) scenes to laugh at, as well as hilarious lines to repeat to your friends later (""... and for marrying a horse.""), this movie is for you. Its sort of like a 1969 version of ""The Naked Gun"" mixed with ""Spinal Tap"" and something else that is more intelligent than both. Check it out."
3712,764003828,5,"This film introduced a film generation to Woody Allen as film maker. A parody of a documentary about a bumblingcrook, its a loosely pieced together series of bits. Some miss the mark, but many are flat out hysterical. Woody robbing the bank (with the teller unable to correctly read his robbery note) and Woody on a chain gang are highlights."
3713,764003828,4,"Not many can see Woody Allen as a thief, if even a simple pick-pocket, but yes, he has been one. I have no doubt in my mind that this is the best movie he has ever done. It has so many scenes that I have loved, but to mention my favorite would lead to sheer chaos. So I will.
Woody Allens character needs money desperately, and so, in a short thought attempt, he jimmies open a gumball machine and gets away with pockets and pockets of quarters.
I have not much to say about this film other than I wouldn't recommend buying it, but you at least have to see it,"
3714,764003828,5,"This is one of those Woody Allen movies that most people have never seen, yet, in my opinion, is still one of his best.  It's along the lines of ""Bananas"" and ""Sleeper,"" so it's definitely a comedy, and it's just one laugh after another.  No chase scenes.  No surround sound.  Just a very funny movie, and one of the few worth having in your collection.
While this DVD is currently out of print, it's probably worth the the extra money as it's hard not to watch over and over.  I've never seen it on TV or cable, and aside from my DVD, the only other time I've seen it was when it originally came out in the movies."
3715,764003828,4,"Take The Money & Run is the first film that featured the Woody Allen triple threat of writing, directing and starring.  The film is set as a documentary on the life of the worst criminal of all-time, Virgil Starkwell, who never pulled off a successful crime in his life.  The film is a fast-paced and sharply written.  It sets up the Woody Allen persona, the likable loser, that he would portray in most of his subsequent films.  Take The Money & Run is an excellent start to a movie legend's fabled career."
3716,764003828,5,"Yes old Woody Allen movies are far different. But that's what is so wonderful. His newer movies tend to be a little less funny at times, yet more interesting as far as the story goes. His old movies may be a little weaker in the story department but are WICKED funny. Try and get through the marching band scene without wetting yourself. Too funny.
Woody Allen is classic in every sense and a national treasure. LONG LIVE WOODY!!!!"
3717,764003828,5,"Though I usually enjoy Woody Allen's more recent work, I'm one of many filmgoers whose heart still belongs to his earlier, anything-for-a-laugh, anarchistic comedies like Bananans, Sleeper, and this one.  Take the Money And Run was Woody Allen's first real film to direct himself and it remains one of his funniest.  Disguised as a documentary, this 1969 film tells the hilarious story of Virgil Starkweather, the world's most inept (if stupidly optomistic) thief.  Like most of Woody Allen's early films, everything is played almost solely for the laughs it might provide and nearly forty years later, it all holds up very well.  Lots of hilarious stuff in here (at times, this film is the funniest Mel Brooks film that Mel Brooks never made) but my personal favorite bits would have to include: Virgil's parents who disguise their indentities by wearing Groucho Marx glasses but will be familiar to anyone whose seen any of Allen's films, Virgil's attempt to rob a bank is foiled when none of the clerks can read his bad handwriting, another robbery goes wrong when a rival gang decides to rob the same bank at the same time, Virgil's attempt to escape from prison by making a fake gun out of soap is ruined when it starts to rain, the sight of Woody Allen on a southern chain gang (and being punished by being locked in the hole with an insurance salesman), and especially the scene where a man Virgil attempts to mug turns out to be not only a childhood school friend but an undercover cop as well.  Directing with a wild-anything-goes-spirit, Woody Allen gives one of his first (and best) ""born loser"" performances as Virgil.  Amongst all the madness, the film also presents a bizarrely sweet love story between Virgil and his wife, who is well-played by the lovely (and the sadly no longer with us) Janet Margolin.  Always underappreciated, Margolin was one of those forgotten, at times almost painfully vulnerable actresses that one can't help but fall in love with everytime she appears on screen. Though overshadowed by the later Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow, Janet Margolin was Woody Allen's first unlikely love interest (in both film and briefly real life) and they have a strong chemistry together that adds much heart to a wild film.  Take the Money and Run remains hilarious and will be enjoyed by both fans of Woody Allen and classic film comedy."
3718,764003828,4,"This Woody Allen movie, not often viewed, is an old gem, just like Bananas and Sleeper. The humor is a little bit childish at times, but it's still Woody Allen humor.
The plot, well, forget the plot anyway. If you are a truly Woody Allen's fan, you will not question his ability to entertain any time."
3719,764003828,3,"""Take the Money and Run"" will not entertain or humour those of us familiar with the rest of Woody Allen's sparkling oeuvre. Its only real value is as a curiosity.
This is Woody establishing his template for later movies, i.e., nebbishy loser, a failure at his chosen occupation, acquires an impossibly beautiful girlfriend, and tries to do right.
The mockumentary style he chooses to utilize for the most part works nicely. At times, though, its tone feels uneven, floating from documentary to narrative fiction and back to documentary. If he had stuck to one style the power of the satire would be much stronger. And now that I think of it, choosing to do an obviously mannered genre parody with your first film is somewhat dubious. It sent him on a path that would lead to the well-meaning but uneven films ""Bananas"" and ""Sleeper"". Not till ""Love and Death"" would he make a film where the parody serves the story rather than the story serving the parody.
While most of the jokes feel forced, there are some truly hilarious proto-Woody moments. The marching band scene (with Woody gamely trying to keep up while tugging along his cello and a chair) knocked me down flat with laughter. And a moment late in the film, with Woody trying to conduct a substantive interview with a rambling subject (Woody keeps saying ""Get to the point"" from behind the camera), is a most effective moment in terms of parodying the documentary form. But other than these, and few others, I was disappointed by the humour. A running gag, where Woody's glasses repeatedly get stomped on by authority figures, was flat the first time I saw it and got flatter each subsequent time.
This film is definitely at the bottom of my personal list of favourite Woody Allen movies. It may be because I prefer his dexterous verbal wit to the juvenile sight gags and physical humour he employs here, or that he had yet to find his footing with this, his first outing. Either way, if you take a pass on ""Take the Money and Run"", you won't be missing too much."
3720,764003828,3,"'Take the Money and Run' is the first film directed, written by, and starring Woody Allen.  While nowhere near the debute of Orson Welles, Allen shows considerable comic promise as he attempts to translate his wierd and wild though shyly neurotic stage act onto the silver screen.
First of all, this movie is hilarious.  No doubt about it, Allen's mockumentary about a looser con is top-notch comedy.  Allen's use of gags are endless (re. glasses, rabbis, soap gun, etc).  They are well-deployed and brilliant.  Allen's dialogue is equally funny, the best line in the film being, ""After twenty minutes, I had decided I wanted to spend my entire life with her.  And after a half hour, I'd given up the idea of takin her purse"".
Yet, in his first film our schlemiel of a director is bound to run into difficulties.  At times it appears he is trying to hard to be funny.  Forced humor never works, and it works even less in Allen's case.  Some jokes just seem overdone.  Then the movie itself goes on for about a half hour too long.
Nevertheless, despite its flaws, this is a great movie of good comedic quality, and should not be dismissed merely because it lacks the artistic brilliance of Allen's later works."
3721,764003828,5,"First, GET THIS MOVIE.  Then, take it home and gather your friends/family.  Then, push PLAY and laugh out loud for two hours!
After you're done, go out and RENT ""Annie Hall"", Woody's supposed ""masterpiece"".  If you CHUCKLE more than THREE times during ALL of ""Annie Hall"", then you got more out of it than I did!
I guess ""Take the Money . . ."" gets no respect because it makes no attempt to be an ""artistic"" nor ""important"" nor ""dramatic"" film - it's just terribly sweet and funny, period!  This is BY FAR my favorite Woody Allen film, or, more specifically, this is basically the ONE film Allen has made that makes me think he is actually funny.
Some will say that I just don't ""get"" Woody's other movies - the supposed explorations of loss, divorce, family life, etc. as seen through the eyes of a ""comic genius"" - and that ""Take the Money . . ."" pales by comparison in its simplicity and lack of depth.  To them, I say, ""Nuts"" because whenever Woody takes on a serious topic (as he does in most of his other movies) he obsesses, stresses, disects, whines, bitches, whimpers, cries and complains it to DEATH!  Trust me, Woody's ""genius"" is anything but - more like blatantly obvious, over-ambitious, self-indulgent ATTEMPTS at genius.  Honestly, there is nothing so UNfunny as someone TRYing (again and again and again . . . . YAWN) to be ""important"".
THIS is Woody best movie effort, hands down - if you want to be nagged, bored, insulted and left mentally barren, watch ""Annie Hall"" or any other of Woody's frustratingly droll movies."
3722,764003828,4,"NOTE:  This review applies to the version of this DVD published in 2000.  It may not apply to newer versions.  If you are buying this DVD new, IGNORE THIS REVIEW.  If you're buying it used, well then...

This is a review of the Take the Money and Run --  not the movie, but the DVD itself.  The movie  is a classic comedy that is appropriate  for kids of 10 and over, as well as adults.  If you've never seen it, the humor is a  riot even though it's over 30 years old.

The DVD was just released and  is a brilliant example of film restoration.  The color is  perfect, the  grain is almost invisible, and you couldn't hope for a better print.  The  two-sided disk has TV-format on one side and letterbox on the other, but  as the film was originally shot for TV the images are nearly identical.  There are a couple of extra items that you can access after the end of the  film, but they're typical stuff.

The sound of the first edition (printed 2000), however, leaves a lot to be  desired. It's essentially mono, which is what you'd expect for a late-60's  TV movie, but there are long intervals of noticeable hum.  If you have a  high-quality audio system, the 60-Hz hum sections are really annoying.  In  addition, there are a couple of key scenes where the voices have been so  severely  filtered that they sound quite unnatural. In a bizarre twist, the  defects are more noticeable on better speakers...and almost imperceptible  on a cheap TV speaker.  So, listen to this one on your crummiest TV and you  won't feel compelled to write reviews like this one!"
3723,764003828,5,"I liked the almost-documentary style that this was shot in. Funniest gag scene is when Woody is chained up with other cons(I nearly busted a gut on that one!). Watch what happens to Woody's soap gun as he almost escapes  from the prison! This one is just downright funny, and does not  include(which I still like) the philosophical discussions on life, death,  sex,etc. This one is hilarious and is superior to Banannas."
3724,764003828,5,"I watch this movie about 10 years ago. (Rented from stores). As a Allen's fan,It's a shame that I didn't even know the name of the movie before. I just can't help from laughing after I played it through the LD player.  (with tears somehow). I recommended it  to all my friends and made me  watching it  over 5 times withih the next 3 days. It's one of the best  comedy I've ever seen! I couldn't buy it in Hong Kong until I find Amazon  and it's great to realize that the DVD is even cheaper than the VHS. Anyone  who loved Woody or comedy. Take it and run!"
3725,764003828,4,"This is the best of Woody Allen's strictly-for-laughs movies.  The interview segments which he uses for both comedic and dramatic purposes in many of his films are probably the most fun here, particularly his  ""parents"" who wear disguises.  The gags are much better than in  his ""Bananas"" and the more than slightly silly plot doesn't bog  down as in his ""Sleeper"".  There are no big moral soapboxes, this  movie is just funny."
3726,764003828,4,"A wonderful parody of crime movies, this mock-documentary tells the story of the worlds most unlikely (and unlucky) criminal - Allen's Virgil Starkwell. This movie goes purely for laughs and is most often successful.  Allen's gift of tapping into the absurd has never been displayed better.  Film is full of gems : Allen being punished by being sent into a hole with  an insurance salesman, his humiliated parents wearing Groucho Marx masks to  disguise themselves and Allen's deadpan backhanded compliment to his  girlfriend: ""That's a nice hat...I see them all over town....Yeah,  they're on sale...in those big bins...millions of them."" A delicious  comedy. If you loved ""Play It Again Sam"" or ""Sleeper""  you'll love this one."
3727,764193597,5,My son loved this DVD. He sings the song all the time now. We read him the book first and he loved it. The video was even better. This one is MUCH better than others we have seen.
3728,764193597,5,"Grandson likes it. Don't be surprised when you see images of poop. Good, educational product."
3729,764193597,2,"This is an entertaining enough cartoon for kids to watch, and mine do, but it is only in the most tangential way about learning to use the potty. It's a fifteen-minute movie and the kid doesn't even get the potty for about eight minutes.

The fact that everything is in rhyme bugs only me. The kids don't mind, and you do turn it out. The 21-month-old likes it more than the three-year-old. It's probably not a coincidence.

We got this with a little book called ""The Potty Book"" about the same little boy with the same art. The book is of great interest to the baby, although it still doesn't really have that much to do with the potty either. The movie and the book are just about an ordinary little boy who learns to use the potty while doing ordinary things. It doesn't tell anyone how to do it."
3730,764193597,5,I purchased this DVD for my little boy to go along with his Henry potty training book.  It's a fun and cute movie that my little one enjoys watching over and over.
3731,764193627,1,"The video is very short. Somewhat a 70's or early 80's style. It shows the girl getting her diaper changed often and how ""happy"" she is about it. The video is extremely short so don't expect a ""movie"". It's just 2 songs. I plan to resell mine -- it made my daughter and my neighbor's daughter go *back* into diapers. I was mortified how this video makes diapers look so ""cool""."
3732,764193627,5,"My daughter loved the The Potty Book for Girls.  After two weeks of potty training, she was 90% consistent with pee in her potty, but poop was still scary to her.  She looked frightened and didn't seem to know if she could do poop in the potty too.  She requested a diaper or ran away instead.  This was stressful for everyone.

I thought the corresponding DVD might help Maya along in the #2 department.  We watched what Maya calls her ""Hannah"" movie (the name of the main character) on a Sunday afternoon.  Within two hours, she had gone poop in the potty for the very first time.  I credit the Hannah video for helping her take that last step.  Since then, Maya has pooped in the potty four more times and is just so proud of each one.  She insists that we go get Daddy so that he can see her poop too.

If your daughter likes the Hannah book, I think she will also like the video.  It is short (about 15 minutes), which some may think is a low value for the money, but I think it is a good length for a young child's attention span (Our daughter is 2 years and 4 months).  It basically retells the book's same story but with animated versions of Hannah and her family.  It also has a fun song that my daughter likes to sing: ""Bye-bye poop"" set to the tune of ""Bye-bye love.""

However, I think the thing that was most effective was that the video actually pictured poop in the potty after Hannah went.  So many videos talk about poop, but they don't show it there.  I think that seeing the poop in Hannah's potty showed Maya that it was really okay to poop in the potty.

Another good thing is that the video, like the book, is very positive and affirming.  It doesn't shame accidents, it encourages children to be proud of when they do pee or poop in the potty, and it clearly shows that it is okay to go potty when you are ready--providing a nice tranisiton from diapers to potty.

Maya requests seeing Hannah at least once most days.  Though a short video, I think that it's well worth the money.  For any parent who has chased around a scared and confused child who has pooped in his/her underpants and doesn't know what to do, this is truly worth it.  Though Maya's pride in her poop may seem bizarre to some, I am happy that she feels proud of what she could accomplish.  As a side note, Maya started trying to dress herself two days after she became successful with poop.  I know that many of these steps are developmental anyway, but I figure that anything that helps support that natural process in a positive way is definitely worth it.

A final factor may be that Maya is in a complete pink obsession mode.  I think it helps that Hannah loves pink too.  Being able to see another girl like her succeed at using the potty makes it all the easier.  This morning, Maya woke up and told me, ""I know how to use the potty.""  That this was her first, happy thought this morning makes me glad.  Thank you, Hannah!"
3733,764193627,3,Really wish the movie went with the story. They should've done two; one version goes with the story and keep the version that's already omn the DVD. It's just eh. I recommend only if they're potty trained and already read the book. It will drive parents nuts. Band is featured on several Sprout shows.
3734,764193627,2,"My daughter's potty training has been a process and I was looking for anything and everything I could get my hands on to reinforce potty training. My 2 year-old seems to like the movie and asks to watch it sometimes. The movie helps keep potty training top of mind. But, the animation quality is very limited -- my husband thought we were watching and old VHS-tape, not a DVD. This is one tool you can use with your kids and I don't think it hurt to buy it -- but I'm looking forward to when my second child is potty trained and we can give this DVD away to someone else! I also agree with the other reviewers that the movie talks about diapers way too much and could send the wrong message to children you are trying to get out of diapers."
3735,764193627,4,"I purchased the DVD for my 2 yr old and she loves it. Even though she no longer watches the movie she still sings the song when she flushes the toilet.  People said it's repetitive, but it has to be for little kids to get it. Some people said it was too long, but I disagree,  it's fine. I let my daughter watch the DVD many many times before having her try to potty, and we put the potty out so she could do  what the movie shows. When we removed the diaper about a week later she used it and never had any accidents, and she was trained that same day. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because they should have gotten someone who sounds younger to do the little girls voice......people were right about that.  I will save the DVD for my younger daughter and hope it has the same effect. Good luck!!"
3736,764193627,4,My child love it and sings the song all the time
3737,764193627,3,"With a name like the ""The Potty Movie"" I expected more about how to use the potty.
The movie was well done about the changes from the role of baby to toddler I just wanted the movie to revolve around using the potty."
3738,764193627,5,"Gets kids excited for potty training. My 2 year old loves watching it, especially after having the book for a while, then seeing it played out. The only thing I can't get over, is the voice they chose for Hannah.... She sounds like an adult.. a burly one.. Other than that it's great!"
3739,764193627,5,Great
3740,764193627,4,"My three year old watched it, she sings it, and about two weks later she was doim=ng number 1 & 2 in the potty. I'm gonna start having my two year old watch it."
3741,764193627,4,Nice little video. She likes to watch it. It seems to keep her interest but I just don't think she quite ready yet.
3742,764193627,5,This helped my daughter with potty training. But oh my is it annoying for adults.
3743,764193627,5,"We needed something to get our daughter interested in potty training, this worked great.  She really picks things up from watching educational programs and this helped her become interested in using the potty. I also purchased the potty book for girls and she also enjoys when we read it to her. Our daughter is potty trained now at 2yrs 2 months and I believe these items help speed up the process. I truly believe your child has to be ready to learn to be potty trained before even trying the potty training process and this cute dvd and book helped. Very happy with purchase."
3744,764193627,5,My daughter loved this video even after she was already potty trained.
3745,764193627,5,kids loved it!
3746,764193627,5,My daughter loves watching it!
3747,764193627,5,"I purchased this video for my twin grand daughters to assist with potty training. They love this movie and relate to all of the activities that Hannah can do such as ""marching, running, eating by oneself, etc"". They have memorized the words to the potty song and will more readily sit on the potty when the movie is played."
3748,764193627,5,"My daughter fell in love with the book as we were starting potty training.  I didn't know at first there even WAS a movie.  As soon as I found out about it, I ordered it.  Even though she was already mostly trained by the time it came in (which was so successful in part because of the book), it was still fantastic for her.  Really, the book is a shortened version of the movie.  In the movie, it's more about getting to be a big girl and starting to do more for yourself than just about potty training.  Hannah (the little girl in the movie) talks about learning to brush her teeth and eat food too.

My daughter just LOVES it.  One of the things I think that makes it work so well is that it doesn't talk down to the toddlers.  The way it's done they can really connect and relate to it.  I just can't recommend this and the book more highly for anyone doing potty training."
3749,764193627,5,"Daughter just turned 3.  Bought this b/c we had so many issues wanting her to use the potty.  She watched this several times per week {she asks to watch it ALOT} for about 6+ weeks.  She loves the cute jingle and it's fun for us adults, too.  The lyrics are helpful in the power of suggestion and the catchy tune which I think is the magic to this one.  Suddenly she just decided that she wanted to use her potty chair instead of wearing diapers.  She has been completely out of diapers during waking hours and naps.  On the 3rd night {last night}, she decided she wanted to go to bed without a diaper and used the potty chair {next to her bed} instead.  Bed was dry the next morning.  Had tried other products {like Elmo's} but they did nothing.  We couldn't be happier with the results."
3750,764193627,5,For the toddler that doesn't like to read books. My little one loves her short slot of TV time. And this is one cartoon she is very excited to sit down and watch. She sings along with the songs.
3751,764193627,4,"My granddaughter seems to really like.  It has inspired her to ""sit"".
It's cute, on a two year old level.  Just want it to work."
3752,764193627,5,I have shown this movie to 2 toddlers and they both love it. They love to watch the real live kids at the beginning and at the end dancing around. They also really enjoy the animated part. I have read other reviews where people complained that Hannah's voice doesn't sound like a kid but it doesn't bother me or the kids I've shown it to. I don't think they even noticed. I like that this movie also briefly touches on a few other things like washing hands and brushing teeth. And it recommends going to the potty first thing when you wake up in the morning. I thought that was a really good recommendation.  Would definitely recommend this product and this seller. Very happy with purchase.
3753,764193627,3,"Besides...the little girl's voice can be annoying and it does not sound like a little girl...sounds like and older fully grown woman.
The movie is also very repetitive, it's like a nonstop sequence of the same things over and over with a very irritation voice.
The songs suck....but my daughter got the point and understood what it was about in the end but still not interested on going potty...I will not give up on trying to potty train her but at this point I know she will go by herself when she is ready so I am not going to put pressure on her over this...I have tried 3 potty DVDs and so far I think I managed to make her pee in her potty like twice.
My daughter just turned 2 and we've been trying to potty train her for the past 3 months....letting her go commando from her waist down seems to be helping us to know when to take her to her potty as we can see the signs that she has to go and sometimes she tells us when she has to go so that is a good start....but like I said this little improvement is not due to this DVD...your kid can get the idea from this DVD but she is not just suddenly start to go potty right away after watching it...so don't expect a miracle, this DVD is not going to do the wonder trick...if your daughter has not gotten  the idea yet, then this DVD is a good buy to start as it is very graphic and encouraging...the reality is that it just takes time, patience and some discipline...just be cool about it, give her a prize for everytime she tried and got it just to motivate her to keep trying and most importantly don't forget to give her a lot of love and it will be all nothing but a matter of time."
3754,764193627,3,"We ordered this video and Elmo's potty video.  My daughter would actually scream if I tried to put this in the DVD player a second time (and she's not normally so vocal) so I stopped trying.  Kind of boring, and she wasn't interested.  Get Elmo instead!"
3755,764193627,5,"My daughter loved this. She was so easy for a lot of reasons and this was one of the,!  Very positive video for toddlers struggling to hold on to the last bit of babydom or move on up to being a toddler with more dependence. It's all about power and them wanting to control something and they sure can control the potty situation :-)"
3756,764193627,5,My toddler loves this movie. She wants to watch it over and ver again. She likes the songs and sings along.  We also purchased the book and she really enjoys both.
3757,764193627,5,"Cute, to the point easy to understand the kids loved it.
both kids ages 3 & 2 very interested kept asking to watch it and tried to imitate"
3758,764193627,1,"I bought this because we were working on potty training our 3 year old girl.  At first she really liked watching it and I started to notice that it was talking about peeing in a diaper.  As I listened a little closer it says ""I pee in my diaper that's what diapers are for""?!?!?!  If this is supposed to be a potty training dvd then it shouldn't say that in the video.  Now when we try to go to the potty she tells me she doesn't have to cause she can pee in her diaper that's what diapers are for.  So thanks a lot for throwing me back a few steps and wasting almost $15!  We then bought Elmo's Potty Time and she loves it and I think it is way better than this one was.  I will be throwing this dvd in the garbage cause I wouldn't want another family to go through what we are with the damage this dvd has caused us for potty training!"
3759,764193627,5,"Personally, I think Hannah's voice in the movie is a little annoying but my daughter seems to really love this DVD. She especially loves the song and now thinks she has to do the potty dance after every potty use. She will be two later this month and is well on her way to being fully potty trained. I would recommend this DVD to any parent in the potty training stage. We have the book and the DVD."
3760,764193627,3,"Bought this video to encourage my 16 months old daughter to start using potty. Unlike other videos, both of us don't seem to be interested in watching the video very often. The voice of Hannah sounds weird, not quite sure it is a sound of a male or a female and sounds no innocence of a young child. Hearing the voice of Hannah bothers me a lot. The tone sounds very flat, like ""Hannah"" is reading the script.

The music is catchy but the song is boring. I cannot bare to listen to it more than 3 times."
3761,764193627,5,My mother n law wanted me to buy this for my grand daughter and this was given at the grand daughters 2nd birthday. We are hoping it helps with potty training.
3762,764193627,2,"This potty video is cute, but repetitive, and my daughter lost interest in it very quickly.  She just refuses to watch it.  Frankly, it's a little boring."
3763,764193627,5,"Bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter for Potty training, and her parents are telling me she is doing great."
3764,764193627,5,"My 2 1/2 year old loves this movie- and it motivates her. The song is catchy and I often hear her singing it. The main character, Hannah, is very relatable and believable. When my daughter uses the potty, she says she's ""just like Hannah"" and if she has an accident, she even quotes her- ""Big girls have accidents, too."" If you're in the process of potty training, or starting to think about, this is a great tool to help."
3765,764193627,5,"THE VIDEO IS CUTE.......MOSTLY FOR A GIRL, WHICH SUITED OUR NEEDS,,,,,BUT IT SERIOUSLY IS AN EDUCATIONAL AND FUN WITH MUSIC INCORPORATED MOVIE,,,,,,,,,,,THAT MY DAUGHTER REQUESTS TO SEE ALL THE TIME-----IN THE VAN AS WE TRAVEL TO THE GROCERY STORE OF COURSE,,,,AND ON THE LAPTOP, ETC....  SHE EVEN ENJOYS IT A YEAR LATER!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3766,764193627,2,I bought this for my niece and my sister wasn't impressed with it. She says this is for more older girls.
3767,764193627,4,"From a kid's perspective, the movie's fun to watch. It's a simple cartoon, it has repeated actions, it has easy words, etc. The movie may be a bit long for a kid to watch though. The song is really catchy. As a parent, you may end up singing along too. The children dance is fun to watch too. My daughter likes dancing along w/ them."
3768,764193627,4,"This is probably my favorite of the potty training dvds we have watched. The illustrations are cute and the show moves fast enough to keep the attention of our two year olds. It's somewhat repetitive with scenes being shown multiple times but that's okay. Most of the focus is on being a ""big kid"" and what big kids do. The going potty section is pretty brief, and only slightly longer than all the other things ""big kids do"". But overall it's a cute show, with terms that match the ones we use and it's nice to have it be little girl specific. I'm glad I bought it."
3769,764193627,5,"Our three-year-old toddler asks to see the Potty Movie when she visits her Nana, and likes me to read her the companion book. I believe the movie and book have helped her with potty training, but they also show Hannah learning to brush her teeth, dress herself, and perform other ""big girl"" tasks that toddlers must learn."
3770,764193627,5,"My granddaughter loves to watch the video, but still does not want to go potty - maybe in a few months!"
3771,764193627,5,My daughter and I loved it. People said it was short but I tought it was just right. Good music for kids fun story.
3772,764193627,5,"Yes(Girl of 3)
Tried everything my girl turns 4 in jan. we tried everything from money, candy and to driving cars. Got this movie and in three days it worked. Love it.

3774,076700941X,5,"I am new to the world of Upstairs Downstairs, but this (the fourth) season is the best season I've watched so far. For those of you who are new to the world of Upstairs Downstairs,  this series is a character driven drama which focuses on the disparate (but yet entwined) lives of the rich Bellamy's and their servants.
Character growth, loss, tragedy and triumph are the themes of this season, as the characters are greatly affected by the trials of world war I.  I highly recommend this for fans of this time period, or fans of BBC drama. I particularly liked the character arc involving Edward the footman, and the arc involving Hazel Bellamy. This is truly an excellent series, I am sorry that it was ended after the fifth season."
3775,076700941X,5,"This series is my favorite in the Upstairs Downstairs canon.  The residents of 165 Eaton Place face the loss and hardships of World War I bravely.  Several important themes, such as duty, honor, love and loss are explored through the lives of several characters.  War comes home, literally, when a Zeppelin drops a bomb on Eaton Place.  James, Edward, Georgina, and most tragically Rose and Hazel are all victims of the war's bloodlust.  There are some extremely fine moments, such as when Georgina sees some wounded soldiers and realizes her playgirl life has to stop, and some extremely funny ones, as in the episode when the Bellamy's drawingroom is commandeered for a dreary charity event.  With this series the writers and artists reached their height!"
3776,076700941X,2,"This is a wonderful classic.  I have purchased each season as it has become available on DVD.  I am usually very happy with A&E's DVD's, but I am not sure what went wrong with, ""Upstairs, Downstairs"".  Season Four had some very long periods where the picture was so blurred that it bothered my eyes to watch it.  Overall, I am quite disappointed with the results on DVD.  I know I will continue to purchase each season, because I really enjoyed the series when it was on television, but I wish the quality was better."
3777,076700941X,5,"When television was reaching for the stars this series which lasted 5 years was like a rocketship in the anals of entertainment. Thirty years later it is still totally absorbing, sophisticated, and fun to watch. It is a classic that my husband and I re-visited recently over a period of several months. If you missed Upstairs Downstairs in the '70's don't miss it now if you can help it. A combination of a British soap opera, classical drama and comedy, we got totally involved in the family upstairs, and the second family of servants, downstairs. It's a hoot."
3778,076700941X,5,"If you like Dalton Abbey there's no way you will not like this, a great show."
3779,076700941X,5,It's a classic!!!
3780,076700941X,5,A superior drama as only the British can make.....
3781,076700941X,5,Totally met expectations
3782,076700941X,5,Lovely!
3783,076700941X,5,Fantastic series!
3784,076700941X,5,"Decided to view this after all these years. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Great frothy historical fiction. The acting was stellar although sometimes overwrought.

If you liked it too I would also recommend ""The Duchess of Duke Street""."
3785,076700941X,5,One of the best series ever!!!
3786,076700941X,5,I like this series.  I have enjoyed every episode I have watched.  Look forward to more.  It's old but the content is still very relevant.  Good show!
3787,076700941X,5,"Amazing how issues of their day are still issues in our day, sad in a lot of ways."
3788,076700941X,5,This is my second time through this wonderful production.  I watched it all for the first time a few years back.  I have come to feel like part of both the upstairs and the downstairs characters on my second time through. I even feel a little British.  I can't stop watching and am sorry it's coming to an end on my second time around.
3789,076700941X,5,Love it!
3790,076700941X,5,Like a good book you can't put down.
3791,076700941X,5,"This show is always, always excellent!"
3792,076700941X,5,This was the original Downton Abbey which is just a spin off of the original upstairs downstairs. It was way ahead of it's time. I watched it back in the 70s and appreciate it even more today. So glad it was available to see again after so many years.
3793,076700941X,5,I love old  the  British  tv  esp. the old days.
3794,076700941X,5,Love this series!
3795,076700941X,5,love this show as I learn history (just like Downton Abbey).... though sometimes the storylines jump from one period to the other and was hard to follow..wish though some of the characters had lived happier lives..all in all a good show and time piece from the era...
3796,076700941X,5,Bravo!
3797,076700941X,5,I am still enjoying the series.  I always look forward to what the characters are up to
3798,076700941X,5,"Nice to watch this great classic show again. Many of the eps are available via YT, the ones that aren't I am purchasing here for the very reasonable price of 1.99 per ep. Picture and sound quality are excellent via Amazon."
3799,076700941X,5,We love it
3800,076700941X,5,It was so nice to be able to come back and watch this in order of the series. I fondly remember watching this on PBS years ago and was happy to see it and watched it straight through. The quality of the video was excellent and the streaming problem free.
3801,076700941X,5,Enjoyed the whole series
3802,076700941X,5,very interesting
3803,076700941X,5,A wonderful look at British life during World War I.  One of the best seasons.
3804,076700941X,5,Love this show
3805,076700941X,5,love it
3806,076700941X,2,Enjoyed the material however the film was dated and It made me sad.
3807,076700941X,3,"Good condition, quick ship, good price, thank you."
3808,076700941X,5,Fabulous
3809,076700941X,5,"I really like this old drama. It is well-cast and and acted. It is in part like a painless history lesson. Some would say its a soap opera. I would not. It is refined and elegant and a wonderful period piece.
I've been happily watching episode after episode free via my Amazon Prime Membership. All of a sudden something went wrong and I can only find it for $1.99 and episode and I have many seasons to go. I'm so anxious to see what happens next."
3810,076700941X,4,I truly enjoyed the series!  Very entertaining-good acting!  I would recommend this series to any one.
3811,076700941X,4,Most enjoyable.
3812,076700941X,1,Season 4 was removed from my Prime free list before I could watch it. It was free and then removed. What gives Amazon? Questioning renewing my Prime membership.
3813,076700941X,5,"I have thorouthly enjoyed the entire series. Have two or three more episodes in Season 4 to go, can't wait for #5. I feel like I'm right
there with the family as I watch all the ""goings-on""."
3814,076700941X,5,I enjoyed all episodes and it's good to see how the English lived through WWI.  They had a much harder time of it since the war came to their homeland.  Hazel is my favorite character.
3815,076700941X,5,Very entertaining
3816,076700941X,5,"The only disappointment was when Meg Wynn Owen Left the series. Although married to somewhat disagreeable James, Hazel could hold her own, and had more compassion for the servants Downstairs. Lord Bellamy needed a wife, so Virginia was added to replace Hazel. Edward and Daisy were a cute couple. Rose was just as loyal as ever. Mrs. Bridges was always proud of her kitchen art. Hudson was a snob, and Ruby was a likeable dimwit."
3817,076700941X,5,I love all seasons of U/D. Jean Marsh had a wonderful concept that was well executed.
3818,076700941X,5,"Superb to return to: still, I think, the best of the many television serials. Season 4 is a moving commemoration of the World War I Centennial as the war decimated all classes. This long but tightly-organized serial never loses focus: the 1929 crash that ends it returns, darkly, to the comic Edwardian beginning."
3819,076700941X,4,Very well done. I had heard people talking allot about this during it'd time but did not get to watch it till now. The characters were wonderful. I became so involved that there were times I cried. A really top drawer series.
3820,076700941X,5,I love this show!  I now remember why I loved this program.  Downton Abbey would not be as successful if this program had not been made
3821,076700941X,4,"Season 4 is pretty good, but somewhat sad as well.  There are some very good performances by  members of the cast ."
3822,076700941X,4,Plots are better than in season 3.  Main complaint is lack of closed captions.  I need that with British shows.
3823,076700941X,5,Loved this series.  Watched all the seasons and must say had a wonderful journey through time.  A lot of the story I had missed when originally saw it on PBS.  Such a fantastic cast and presentation of the Victorian Era.
3824,076700941X,5,"With waiting for the new season of Downton Abbey, I decided to get my Edwardian fix from Upstairs Downstairs. To say the least I see that Downton was greatly ""inspired"" by this series. I recognize some of the plot lines and characters, with different names of course. I highly recommend the entire series, must start at the beginning, with the first episodes being somewhat less sophisticated than the later. A good watch for those waiting for Downton."
3825,076700941X,5,"I missed this when it was originally broadcast and have often expressed my regrets to others over the years. Imagine my delight when it was offered to prime members. I've not been disappointed. I find the story lines entertaining and more racey than I expected, given the time it was originally produced. I only wish there were more seasons to watch!"
3826,076700941X,3,"I remember seeing this show on PBS as a child. I became interested in watching it after seeing Downton Abbey. I really liked the first season of the series. I watched it in a marathon over a cold winter weekend. The second season kept my interest and I watched it over another winter weekend. It is still interesting but not as much as the first two seasons. I didn't like some of the character changes and some of the original character such as Hudson & James Bellamy became a bit irritating to me. If you liked seasons #1, #2, #3 & Downton Abbey, give it a watch. I watched it to finish out the series. It is not as good as the previous seasons."
3827,076700941X,5,"I loved all of Upstairs, Downstairs when it came out decades ago, and I still do. But it is after all a high class soap opera, and if that is not your thing you may not care for it. I find it to be excellently crafted, cast and acted. Very rich visually and it seems to give an excellent feel for the time and a different culture and value system than today's. Not sure which is best."
3828,076700941X,5,"After the very first episode, I was unable to stop and continued to watch all the Seasons every chance I got. Superb story lines, excellent acting. Love watching movies in that era and seeing how they cooked every meal from scratch and by hand without any modern conveniences. The cooks spent their entire day in the kitchen making meals.  Interesting to realize how many cooking products we have today to lessen our time in the kitchen!"
3829,076700941X,5,I have not yet finished with the whole  Season 4. The characters become like old friends. .I love history I am disappointed that Season 5 is not available for prime time members at no additional cost.
3830,076700941X,5,Wonderful ! A seventies Downton Abbey. 165 Eaton is not as lush of a setting; however the characters are rich in depth and complexity.
3831,076700941X,5,"I watched the first episode of Upstairs -- Downstairs more than 40 years ago and never missed an episode. I loved the characters, actors, stories  -- everything about the series. A perfect 10.

The fourth season of, Downton Abbey failed in my opinion, especially in connecting the last few minutes of Season 3  with the first few minutes of the first episode of Season 4."
3832,076700941X,5,Done with season four.  Only one more season to go...wahhhh!  I so love this program...best I've ever seen!  Enjoy it!
3833,076700941X,5,Feel like I know the character personally.  Only have a few more episodes to watch.  Will be so disappointed when it ends.
3834,076700941X,5,Been binge watching Upstairs Downstairs. Each season is better than the last. Will be so sad when I am finished with Season 5.
3835,076700941X,5,"These CD's arrived on time and in good order.  I have not seen the films yet, but am looking forward to viewing them.

Thank you,

3836,076700941X,5,We love this series and have watched it several times. It is great fun as well as an interesting look at turn of the Century Britain.  Definitely Time well-wasted!
3837,076700941X,4,"The characters in Upstairs/downstairs improve each season, both in depth and complexity as well as being easier to identify with. The move toward War and the involvement of the family members, upstairs and downstairs, make this the best season so far."
3838,076700941X,5,"Upstairs Downstairs is a truly good watch.  It's a melange of terrific characters and intriguing plots.  Yes, I have thoroughly enjoyed Downtown Abbey, but this is certainly comparable. The Abbey  is far more imposing and family members and servants more numerous, but you can binge watch several seasons of Upstairs Downstairs and enjoy the Bellamys and Hudson and his crew."
3839,076700941X,5,"I LOVE this series!  The characters are very well-written and well-acted.  I am transported back in time to WWI and love the story lines with the different people in the house.  This show brings history alive in a very entertaining way.  I usually watch an entire episode while I am walking on my treadmill and I get my exercise without even realizing it!  LOVE, love, love it!!"
3840,076700941X,4,"I really enjoyed the characters in this program.  I used this show as something relaxing to watch before going bed but, beware! I found it deliciously addictive. My favorites included the cook and butler downstairs.  Upstairs the major and his father.  Heck even the lawyer played on my heart."
3841,076700941X,5,The series addresses the issues arising from World War I and how some people embraced the changes and others resisted change! In many ways very timely to present day responses to change!
3842,076700941X,4,"It is always sad to hear, read, and or see how the World War I and II impacted people's lives.  Learned a bit more of history watching this show."
3843,076700941X,5,"Great history lesson, great people lesson, great moral lesson and great fun.  It doesn't get better than this wonderful Classic series.  This series was the beginning of Masterpiece and earns the name till this very day."
3844,076700941X,5,"I thoroughly enjoy the series. Love the characters and the era it is set in. It is all great entertainment. Very sad to see some of the characters go. but, really like some of the new ones."
3845,076700941X,5,In the 70's I was living mostly out of the country or away from a television.  I enjoy Brittish drama and humor so this was a good way for me to catch up on an old classic.  I think they have done a great job of capturing the essence of the time in the early 1900's and have given it a lot of heart.
3846,076700941X,5,"This series is obviously the ""inspiration"" for Downton Abbey which I love..  This really is the City Version of Downtown...!"
3847,076700941X,5,"I love Upstairs, Downstairs.  The acting, the sets, and the story lines are interesting and historical.  I have loved all the seasons and think it is much better than the newer version."
3848,076700941X,5,"I have never considered this kind of life, especially the servants. An eye opening series! Addicting to watch, but interesting."
3849,076700941X,5,"A very clever and interesting story of two levels of society.
 Much interweaving of personalities, situations and difficulties.  I truly enjoyed each episode and could hardly wait to finish the series.  Acting and costuming were good.  Only one thing I would say was disappointing--that last suicide!
Three suicides in one series is a bit much.  Otherwise, I loved it."
3850,076700941X,5,Enjoyed the old Upstairs Downstairs series.  Very entertaining.  The characters brought so much light on the times and how they each had their own ordeals to handle.
3851,076700941X,5,England is at war and all of the household is impacted too.  Follow both the upstairs and the downstairs during the war to end all wars.
3852,076700941X,5,This is the first British miniseries that I watched but I never saw every episode until now.  It's totally entertaining while being historically informative...a different perspective on how WWI affected lives in Britain. It was wonderful to view the entire series.
3853,076700941X,5,"Its no secret, U D is one of the great series. one two three four five six seven eight nine!"
3854,076700941X,4,The series is entertaining yet clearly portrays that love is so far above class! Series has kept me wanting to see characters succeed  because of compassion and love.
3855,076700941X,3,Most of this season was boring for me. Mainly because I got tired of James character and he began to annoy me. The other story lines were interesting.
3856,076700941X,1,This was not the second season. It was a collection of different seasons. Which I had all but the second season. Just bought the second season  has been shipped will receive it Wednesday  Have a nice day
3857,076700941X,5,"I absolutely love  the stories going on both Upstairs and Downstairs! Can't believe is was written and filmed so long ago, yet the stories just pull you right in! Am about to enter the 5th Season, and am a little sad, that this is the last Season. Love, love love the characters!"
3858,076700941X,5,"Continued to be as great as the other series, hated for it to come to an end, looking forward to the new series coming up in jan."
3859,076700941X,5,"I LOVE this show. I am enjoying it more watching it 20 years later. The filming, sets, costuming may not be as opulent as Downton Abbey, but the story line, is much, much better.
ON MY TOP TEN LIST OF FAVORITE TV SERIES OF ALL TIME."
3860,076700941X,5,"I never got to watch this series when it was first on, so when I found it on my Prime, I began to watch it from Season 1 through Season 5.  I loved every minute of it and even watched the spin-off about Sarah.  I almost wish there was more of it, but realize some things must come to a final conclusion."
3861,076700941X,5,LOVE THIS!  UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS IS AN AWESOME CLASSIC!  I LOVE BRITISH TV.  NOT TOO EXPLICIT AND VERY INTRIGUING.  THANK YOU
3862,076700941X,5,"These are classics now and should be safeguarded and yet available to the public.  It would be a good idea to air some of these earlier and superb programs for current audiences as well.
We don't the sense real ness from the movie like programs as we do from those more staged like real life."
3863,076700941X,4,"As I have been watching this series, I have fallen in love with some characters and grown to dislike others.  I generally dislike any focusing in on death, war, primitive medicine practices, etc as they make me feel queasy or really sad, but this season I really enjoyed despite the focus on the war.  I found it fascinating how they told the stories of the upstairs family and the downstairs family, how the war impacted them personally and how they were able to triumph over some of the awfulness that war brings.  Very well scripted and acted!"
3864,076700941X,5,"I am a big fan of the Series Upstairs, Downstairs.  Season 4 is very good.  The serious nature of World War I on London is so interesting and well done. The actors are very good in this series."
3865,076700941X,5,I'm on the last season. I will miss it when I'm done.  I've loved every minute of the series. I would highly recommend it.
3866,076700941X,4,"I don't remember what famous person made the quote ""War is Hell"".  It is an accurate statement, of course.  Season 4 of the Bellamy's follows them through the first World War.  I am sure that the scripts were historically accurate. Season 4 upholds the series tradition of EXCELLENT acting, plots, and production quality.  I could not give 5 stars because I found the amount of time and detail devoted to war-time plots became a little depressing."
3867,076700941X,5,I watched all seasons of original & was sad to reach the end.  So glad to have new one.  Hope it continues.
3868,076700941X,5,Season 4 continues at the same high level as the earlier episodes. It is amazing that after almost 40 years this series is still so fresh -- and relevant.
3869,076700941X,4,"You have to watch the seasons in order. Made in the early 70's some of it deals with contemporary subjects . I love English shows because people don't look perfect.  Some of the shows can be really good.  A few can be boring but, overall I would definitely recommend it."
3870,076700941X,5,"I really hate to see this program end. It is like visiting a kinder, more gentle time in life. Very relaxing."
3871,076700941X,5,"Entertaining, nonviolent, real life in the 1920s England. A lot like Downton abbey in theme, and still very different. Very good."
3872,076700941X,5,"It was good to receive the fourth season after watching the first two seasons. It's good to see the aristocratic Bellamy family, along with the servants, do their part to aide the war wounded. Can't wait to purchase the fifth season."
3873,076700941X,5,"I watched this back in the 70's and I have to say I still love it.  Not like Downton Abby in terms of the filming...DA is more like a movie whereas Upstairs, Downstairds is more like a play.  Great stories, great screenplays!"
3874,076700941X,5,An amazing range of emotions are displayed in most British dramas and this is no exception.  I heartily recommend taking the time to watch the entire series.
3875,076700941X,5,"The acting is great as usual in BBC productions. I particularly like the in-depth view of each ""class's"" lifestyle.  Definitely worth the watch."
3876,076700941X,5,"If you love British dramas, then you will love this classic!!  I missed it when aired years ago, but kept hearing about it.  I am glad I found it at Amazon."
3877,076700941X,5,"Being a half Brit, this series brought back many things. My mother used to sing one of the songs in the series. The story had many ups  and downs as well a lot of laughs. I hope our children appreciate how easy they have it."
3878,076700941X,5,"Iconic British  program, loved by all with great quality acting I have seen it before, but second time around is still fantastic!!!!!"
3879,076700941X,5,"I love this show. I am truly addicted to it on a nightly basis and I will be sad when I finally finish the series. I got watching it after I felt the emptiness of finishing ""Downton Abbey,"" and now I realize the source of DA. It was my friend's favorite back in the '70s. I only wish I had had the sense to watch it then!"
3880,076700941X,5,"After 4 seasons Upstairs Downstairs just keeps getting better.  Wonderful story line and great performers. I anxiously await the new season,"
3881,076700941X,5,"Enjoying totally reviewing the many episodes of one of my favorite series ""Upstairs, Downstairs"".

It's wonderful to be able to once again go back in time to this original series that my family enjoyed watching together all those years ago.

The quality of viewing this on my Kindle is extraordinary, and I highly recommend this to a new generation."
3882,076700941X,4,These period episodes were well done on almost counts. I liked the actor's dress and speech. The story line was interesting and the characters part of my male believe family.
3883,076700941X,5,"I loved the entire series.  I came across it after finishing Downton Abbey.  Actually, found the remake first, that was made shortly before or about the same time as DA.  I liked that one, not as much as DA, but it did start growing on me.  Then when that ended, I found the original Upstairs Downstairs.  Different feel, and film quality, but I fell in love with it.  Some of the episodes with Elizabeth grated on me...  Overall, it was just a very well done series.

I watched every episode of all five seasons, and was so sorry to see it end!!  But the ending of the series was done so well.  After finishing THAT one, I was feeling lost, and then I found Thomas and Sarah.  Of course I had to watch those shows as well...and I believe there was only one seaon?"
3884,076700941X,5,I will miss visiting my friends upstairs and downstairs.  This is one of the best series ever produced.  Well done!
3885,076700941X,5,"It was fun watching. I will watch every episode and will watch all seasons. Watched in the middle of the night
when all was quiet."
3886,076700941X,5,I didn't watch this when it was on TV and I am really enjoying it on my Kindle. I only have a few more episodes to watch and I hate to see it end.
3887,076700941X,4,"After three seasons most shows have really started to wind down.
The same is true about this series, but it doesn't mean there aren't a few stories left to tell."
3888,076700941X,5,I enjoyed this entire series...and was sorry it came to an end. I enjoyed this and especially liked Ms Georgina.
3889,076700941X,4,The stories might be from the past but are able to relate to them in the presence.  It's nice to have entertainment that isn't tainted with profanity and nudity.  Wish all tv shows could be at this quality.
3890,076700941X,5,"I rated this show the way I did because I really enjoyed it. I'm 33 and live in America and found this show like a book you can't put down. The characters, the old ways of living etc. I just fell in love with all the characters and episodes."
3891,076700941X,4,"Most of the season is war related. It has many emotional scenes and changes to the family up and down stairs.
Near the end I did begin to wish the war would end.

The characters were very well played. i especially liked Hazel and Rose this season."
3892,076700941X,4,"I started backward, first Downton Abby, then the 2010 Upstairs Downstairs series then I got interested in the original, glad I did.  I did a marathon of the five seasons.  Fun!"
3893,076700941X,5,"I like to follow the story of how these people adap to life during wars, romance and death.  I like to think that life was really like that."
3894,076700941X,5,"two thumbs up! Great watch..the whole dang thing is just great..will watch again with no problem!
Holy crap a great watch! now is that enough words?"
3895,076700941X,5,Great presentations of war time events and social ramifications.  Some characters seemed somewhat overdone but not entirely unbelievable.  Enjoyed the thoughtfulness of the scripts.
3896,076700941X,5,"I am a Brit abroad at the moment and watching this series made me feel my English roots again !  The class structure, the changes that came with the 1914-18 war, the entrenched attitudes that resisted the changes and the frustration felt by those bringing in the new ideas.  Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is also there and made me so sad that it was not recognised for what it was.  But the most beautiful thing about all these episodes is of course, the relationship between upstairs and downstairs.  It makes one aware that the boundaries of what we consider family can stretch and stretch.  The actors are superb and I wonder where they are now.  It is just a perfect slice of England and the English with all our prejudices and funny ways of doing things - stiff upper lip, public school - but everyone just muddles along and makes their way through all the turmoil.  A really fine series that I will enjoy watching again and again."
3897,076700941X,5,I loved every episode and couldn't wait to watch the next one!  In fact I have watched in several times over.
3898,076700941X,5,Love this series and i do not care that it was made in the seventies because it is timeless.  Beautiful period piece and lovely characters.
3899,076700941X,5,i just loved it  it's one of the best series i've seen for awhile i would recommend it highly for anyone
3900,076700941X,3,"I did not watch this movie..we saw the trailors and it was ordered through a glitch in our computer when trying to order or pre order a 4TH season of Downton Abby. Sorry, but we won't be watching it either."
3901,076700941X,5,I am a history buff and I love how they weave the history of the time into the program.  I have my Ipad out and am checking all information mentioned about the history of the time during the show.  It is spot on.
3902,076700941X,5,"What can I say - I got sucked into the characters in Season 1, and just couldn't stop watching.  Was very sad when I had finished the last season.  Wanted to know more.  Love the sweetness of Rose, and of course, Hudson's voice....  Enjoy"
3903,076700941X,5,"This series is quite a interesting mix of humor and drama set very accurately in the early 1900's. I find the characters to be believable and you find yourself loving, hating and routing for them as their lives unfold in this one household. I am almost finished with the series and find myself missing them already!"
3904,076700941X,5,We have enjoyed this so much!!!  It's definitely a keeper.  It's a shame that soon there will be no more to enjoy.
3905,076700941X,5,"I saw this show after getting hooked on Downton Abbey and was not disappointed.  Great series, great actors.  Really fun and addicting."
3906,076700941X,5,This is so much fun.  First of all you can understand the English very well.  They characters are so believable.  I just love this program but especially Rose and Hudson.  We don't realize how much times have changed.  I would highly recommend this video.
3907,076700941X,5,"I love this series, and have rediscovered it after I first watched it almost 40 years ago.  It is timeless.  But such a sad ending."
3908,076700941X,5,"Recommended for conventional, realistic portrayal of a very different time and set of circumstances in Great Britain.  I always feel comforted and content after watching an episode, recalling a time when families were truly close and vitally interdependent on each other, for practical and emotional needs."
3909,076700941X,5,"I love this series, and I remember watching it when I was young. Thanks for providing it. Will watch it again someday
L Smith"
3910,076700941X,4,Watched Upstairs Downstairs in the 70s and enjoyed it.  Enjoying it even more this time around.  A real precurser to Downton Abbey which really borrowed heavily from U/D.
3911,076700941X,5,I watched each and every episode of this series and found quite entertaining. I highly recommend this to anyone!!! You can expect to laugh and even come close to tears at times. Watch and enjoy!!
3912,076700941X,5,"The story line, the scenery, the background & costumes and particularly the actors all came together perfectly. It was very absorbing & my wife kept wanting to see just one more episode even though we had agreed to watch just one a night. It didn't take us very long to watch the entire series. No complaints at all."
3913,076700941X,5,I enjoyed this series.  I had never seen it in the 70's but heard a lot about it.  I am so glad I tuned in.  Timeless.
3914,076700941X,5,I enjoyed the whole series.  The clothing and historical information were especially informative.  I would recommend this whole series to anyone.
3915,076700941X,5,I missed Upstairs Downstairs in the 80's but am absolutely loving it now.  Many of the same themes as Downton Abbey.  Excellent acting and dialogue.  Try it - you will like it!
3916,076700941X,5,Loved this series and the quality of the picture and ease of download made it a pleasure to watch.  I will probably watch it again someday.
3917,076700941X,5,"This show has an amazing cast, not to mention riveting plot lines. As a costume drama, it is pretty enough but due to the age of the show and the budget constraints back then, the production quality is not as great as contemporary period dramas such as seen on hit series Downton Abbey, the remake Upstairs, Downstairs and others.

The series ran for five seasons from 1971 to 1975. The primary setting for the show is 165 Eaton Place, a roomy townhouse, and the time frame spans Edwardian England, the First World War up till 1930. The series explores the lives of the upper-class Bellamy's (upstairs) and their servants (downstairs), and some of the themes covered during the show is the difference between the upper and lower classes, societal changes, the suffragette movement, marital strife, relationship problems, and the plight of the poor, among others.

The Bellamy's are made up of Richard Bellamy, MP (portrayed by David Langton) and his wife, Lady Marjorie Bellamy (played by Rachel Gurney), and the couple have two children, James (Simon Williams) who is serving in the military, and strong-willed Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett).

Meanwhile, the servants downstairs comprise competent and firm butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson); cook Mrs. Bridges (Angela Baddeley); head house parlour maid Rose Buck (Jean Marsh, who returns in the remake and takes on the role of housekeeper); a footman, and a kitchen maid (and the occasional changes in secondary staff).

I would advise those new to the show to begin by watching Season 1 first as there is much background to the characters and stories that can be better appreciated and understood if watching chronologically. Season Four is as interesting as the previous three seasons - the writing is always great, and the ensemble cast continues to amaze with their wonderful acting talents.

This fourth season of the show sees WW I in full swing - James Bellamy returns from the front for a break and finds himself consigned to a desk job (even though he still travels), something which sits very badly with a man who yearns to join his regiment in the thick of battle; Hazel and James' marriage is not altogether happy, a recurring theme from the later part of Season Three, but the war has sort of masked their marital difficulties; footman Edward marries his sweetheart, parlour maid Daisy, and also goes off to war; many from below stairs contribute what they can to the war effort - kitchen maid Ruby goes off to work in a munitions factory, Rose works part-time as a tram conductor, and butler Hudson works part-time in the constabulary. Mr. Bellamy, Sr. gets offered a key government post and ward Georgina tries her hand at nursing.

As much as I love Downton Abbey, I felt that this season of Upstairs, Downstairs credibly explored all the complexities of WW I - focusing more on the personal lives of the occupants of 165 Eaton Place and how the war affects them all in terms of relationships, duties, and sacrifices. This is one of the best British period dramas I've ever watched, and that's saying a lot given the vast number of BBC period dramas I've amassed over the years. I plan to get the 40th Anniversary DVD of all five seasons of this show to add to my collection. Upstairs Downstairs is truly a timeless classic"

After watching the first season of Upstairs, Downstairs via Amazon Instant Download (free for Prime members), I was so captivated by this well-written and credibly acted series that I purchased the rest of the series (via instant download) and have been enjoying the show since (except for Season 5 which is sadly not available via streaming).

3920,076700941X,1,"This review is about Amazon's hosting of the fourth season, not about the season itself.  The fourth season is a great one, but the way Amazon has bungled this makes it hard to enjoy it.

It is really annoying that they have messed up the episodes by putting them in the wrong order and mislabeling them.  Half the tension in the episode they list as first is confusing if you haven't watched the THREE episodes that predate it.  The occasional mislabeled episode in the previous seasons was easy to overlook, but in this case, its flat out unprofessional.

Also, I bought the season, and yet still had to purchase two of the episodes separately.

If Amazon really wants to make their video streaming the place to go, they'll have to avoid these things in future."
3921,076700941X,5,"The whole series is wonderful.  My only disappointment with the versions I have ordered so far is that there is are no subtitles, and the spoken English dialect is sometimes very hard to follow.  Would really be nice to have the captions.  Other than that, this was in excellent condition and received very promptly."
3922,076700941X,5,"The aristocratic Bellamy's of 165 Eaton Place, London, live upstairs over the downstairs clockwork servant aid led by butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson). Classic Edwardian masterful plots in this funny and dramatic nostalgic time-travel covering 1912-1914, pre-World War One.
Richard Bellamy (David Langton) and house heir James (Simon Williams) need quite a crew downstairs to keep their house in order. Also stars Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) and Miss Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett-`A Bit of a Do'). Mrs. Bridges (Angela Baddeley) cooks up a storm, while maid Rose (Jean Marsh, co-creator) helps keep linens and affairs tidy.

A TV gem period series. This 27-year span epic won 9 Emmys, 2 BAFTAs, Golden Globe & a Peabody Award, 31 nominations. Series 4 alone won ""Outstanding Limited Series"" plus a second Emmy. Classic Edwardian masterful plots in this funny and dramatic back time-travel over 3 decades inside the Bellamy house. A crowning British achievement in the 70's and worth owning today. It is available in a complete collection, highly recommended if you do not own any of the sets individually.

SERIES 4: 13 wartime episodes averaging 51 minutes each cover years 1914-18. The Great War is happening, and it touches the Bellamy house stairway ends. Struggles with soldiering, war efforts, changes in lifestyle due to war, and love at all times. A fine dramatic, but also historical look at WWI, on the London home front. You get romance mingled in with the troubles of wartime.

This is a classic series & very enjoyable to people that like British Soap Operas."
3924,076700941X,5,"This series is so amazingly captivating, I'm glad I never had the time to see it before.  For one thing, I'd never have been able to get through nursing school taking time to watch TV, and for another I'd never have lived through waiting for the next episode.  I'm way too much of an immediate needs gratification sort of person!!

The setting is a period to which I have become more and more attracted, the two decades between World War I and World War II.  Times are changing, but not necessarily for the better, or at least not for everyone.  The old guard is losing its hold over society, but those newly rising to power are not necessarily better than those who wielded it before.  If anything the old guard, based as it was on a landed aristocracy with a vested interest in England as a property, had reasons to keep things from falling totally apart for the middle and lower classes.  Their pride of place came as much from their perceived obligations as from their assets.  The rising nouveaux riche are vested in money alone, a portable commodity that can be invested wherever there is profit to be had.  Their focus is on who has the most of it; without ties to anything, they take no responsibility for the society that makes their fortunes.  Theirs were the ideals upon which our present world and its predicaments are based.

The characters of the series are reflections of the changing times.  The Upstairs family sees the pater familias, an aristocratic man of conservative principles, losing ground to the younger members of the family who are going through the emotional ravages of World War I.  They question everything and challenge many of the basic principles of social behavior, including the roles of women, political power and who should wield it, and the behavior of society during war.  Below stairs, too, there is disruption.  The younger generation questions the reasons for the demand for ""gratitude"" for their position of servitude and see the efforts of the butler to prevent their adopting new ideals as repressive and patronizing.  They question the need to ask the family they serve for permission to marry, to hold a war job, to question their additional work load without commensurate compensation.

Upstairs Downstairs is a world in flux, much like our own, and the efforts of the extended family to adjust to it are absolutely mesmerizing."
3925,076700941X,5,"Having been a fan of this show since the early 70's, I truly am amazed on how the show still holds up today! Season 4 was not one of my favorite years for the show, although the cast almost stayed the same, with the exeption of a few new one's, it built up to Season 5, the last year for the series. It is still a good show to watch, and a splendid period piece as well."
3926,076700941X,5,"I did see this series when PBS had Masterpiece Theater.  However, I think it is great fun to go back and watch this again.  Excellent actors, no blood or gore, and a chance to escape back to the early 1900 life style."
3927,767001311,4,"The Bob Newhart Show was one of the 10 best TV shows ever, and the picture quality in this 6-tape collection is very good. It's nice to see all the episodes in their uncut form, as opposed to the reprehensible syndication practice of cutting scenes to sell more commercial time. My only qualm with this collection is that there are only 2 episodes per tape. Hopefully there will be a DVD collection of this excellent series and the follow-up series, Newhart (1982-1990)."
3928,767001311,5,"One of my top five favorite shows. It feels strange though because now I'm older than Bob was! So fun to watch again and it's great watching it on a 65"" tv. It's a little grainy as opposed to a high-definition show filmed today, but I prefer it that way because it takes me right back to the 1970's with Bob's green couch. But if you have a modern blu ray player with 'upconversion' it will smooth things out even more. Funny blooper: in one episode you can clearly see a camera & cameraman on the right side of the set for a couple seconds. The only real problem was that on just a couple episodes (season three I think) the audio wasn't in sync with the video. Barely off but just enough to be distracting. Fortunately only those episodes. I love the bonus features, especially the commentaries - only wish the Gag Reel was longer but I know they weren't thinking about DVD box sets back then. No problems with the discs and I inspected them all for damage like scratches or fingerprint smudges. That happened with another show I bought, but this packaging is very nice. I like the brown 'wood paneling' look of the box and the bonus booklet. The booklet is well made with a history of the show's beginnings and summary of each episode. Well worth the money. I've watched it twice!"
3929,767001311,5,The funniest Season of all Bob Newhart Shows !
3930,767001311,5,Great classic sitcom
3931,767001311,5,GREAT PRODUCT FAST DELIVERY
3932,767001311,2,"The series itself arguably merits 5 stars, but after trying to watch three, allegedly brand-new discs that had to ""skip over damaged areas,"" I gave up and returned the whole set for a refund. Shout! is respected for the quality of its products. I'm at a loss to interpret what happened.

REVISION OF PREVIOUS REVIEW: At times it is difficult in Amazon reviews for readers to determine exactly what is being reviewed: the product (in this case, a TV series), its manufacturer (here, Shout!), or the vendor with whom Amazon is dealing (Crystal Choice). To clarify: (1) The first Newhart show is a classic sit-com. (2) Crystal Choice is an honest vendor that tried to make good on a sale that backfired through no fault of their own. (3) Shout! atypically, in my experiencehad quality control problems with the new set of discs I was sentthree of which were unplayable."
3933,767001311,1,"Same as season 5- too ""liberal"""
3934,767001311,2,"Last season, not so funny."
3935,767001311,5,"Don't be put off by the comments and the ratings on the DVD company that put these out and the timing relating to the final couple seasons if you were to buy these individually.  This is common and not much we consumers can do about it.  So  I am rating the show itself... in this case, all in one box, which is what they should have done in the beginning, hence the complaints who bought season by season...

Anyway, Bob is the ultimate straight-man.  He's not over the top,  phoney, or selling out his character for a laugh.  His comedy centers on his reaction to others (quirky people & situations) around him.  This show can come across slow, when compared to the hyper shows of today, where everything has to be sexual comedy on the cutting edge and inappropriate for family.  Bob is a class act and never stoops to those tactics.  That's exactly WHY I like it.  Breath of fresh air."
3936,767001311,4,"I didn't see much of The Bob Newhart Show when it was originally on television, so almost all of this series was new to me.  During the first season, I was only getting a rare chuckle, if that, out of the episodes, and I was wondering if I had made a mistake in purchasing the complete series.  Fortunately, seasons 2-5 were better, and I was getting chuckles and sometimes laughing out loud at the episodes.  The introduction of the character known as ""The Peeper"" was, for me, a misstep, because he was too over-the-top silly to be amusing.  Season 6 was a letdown, with more slapstick (e.g. Zorro) and fewer good jokes."
3937,767001311,4,Does not get any better than Bob!!!!
3938,767001311,5,funny
3939,767001311,5,"One of my all time favorite shows and all time favorite actor. No problem with any of the recordings, just some great TV. I bought both Newhart series and have enjoyed watching them both."
3940,767001311,5,Gotta love Bob Newhart - hope he's around a lot loner.
3941,767001311,5,Very good.  Enjoyed.
3942,767001311,5,classic tv
3943,767001311,4,enjoying it
3944,767001311,5,Funny very happy !!
3945,767001311,5,Excellent!
3946,767001311,5,all went well...thanks
3947,767001311,4,Great series
3948,767015525,1,"The most looked-forwarded to movie of the year for me. Now, the one I hope I can forget the quickest.  I blame it all on the director. Who in Hollywood pays these imbeciles to make a movie like this. How in the world  could anyone ruin a movie starring Fiennes, Connery, Thurman? - Totally  beyond my comprehension. If anyone out there knows  a place I can get an  elective frontal lobotomy, please let me know. Do a service to one in deep  suffering."
3949,767015525,3,"I approached The Avengers with some trepidation, courtesy of several negative reviews, including one Australian critic who proclaimed it the worst movie he had ever seen. Having been one of just 42 people in the  cinema when I saw the film, I was wondering just how bad it was going to  be. My fears were unfounded. It was entertaining, amusing and suitably  peculiar. I say suitably peculiar as, being a fan of the 60's TV series,  any deviation from the concept would have been totally unsatisfactory. The  movie, set in the sixties, was not a nostalgia trip (something which would  have been a distraction) but still managed to capture the essence of that  period. The plot was as silly as any in the TV series, thank goodness, and  the villain (Sean Connery) was appropriately unbelievable. It wasn't one of  Connery's best performances but he obviously enjoyed hamming it up  outrageously. You have to enjoy it for that alone. Don't fall into the trap  of comparing Uma Thurman and Ralph Feines with Diana Rigg and Patrick  Macnee. They play their parts differently, not better or worse, just  different. The comparison is irrelevant. The cinematography is excellent,  as are the special effects. Overall, a highly enjoyable film that should  appeal to fans of the genre, and Avengers fan specifically. Not a great  movie, but a good production. Its lack of success is unfortunate, and the  bad press overdone. It's likely to attain some degree of cult status within  a couple of years."
3950,767001311,5,Excellent set of DVD with non-stop laughter.  I enjoyed Bob Newhart and the gang more today than I did in the 70's!
3951,767001311,5,"There comes a time in every show when the plots/material become more and more familiar, trite, or benign and it's the audience's relationships with the characters (and the actors) that carry the bulk of the entertainment value. It happened with more contemporary ratings juggernauts like Friends and Seinfeld, and it happened with TBNS.  The final season of this great show was often just plain absurdly silly, with the characters behaving more like _caricatures_ of their earlier selves. And yet it still produced some of the funnier lines (""Uhh...you can call me 'Tatum.'"") and situations (Emily attending a reunion as Carlin's wife) of the entire series. Because Newhart had essentially checked out of the series after Season 5 -which was supposed to be the final season- his castmates spent more time center stage. Though something of a style departure from the first 5, Season 6 ended the series on a relatively (to other series' final seasons) strong note."
3952,767001311,4,"I happen to like Bob Newhart even though he is pretty much the same all the time.  This series is certainly ""dated"" but it is well done and amusing. I enjoy watching an episode every day or two when I sit down with a cup of coffee.  I'm glad I purchased it and look forward to many  ours of enjoyment. A FEW WEEKS LATER....I'M BEGINNING TO BE VERY UPSET AT THE NUMBER OF EPISODES THAT CANNOT BE VIEWED BECAUSE  OF FREEZES.  THE WHOLE LAST HALF OF SEASON 4 COULD NOT BE VIEWED AND 2 OR 3 EPISODES OF AN EARLIER SEASON WERE THE SAME WAY."
3953,767001311,5,Classic show. Great Stuff. Great service. Thank you
3954,767001311,5,One of my favorite comedy shows.  Bob Newhart is tops. No dirty jokes - which I prefer.  Good clean fun!
3955,767001311,4,good.
3956,767001311,5,Love the Bob Newhart show. Tons of laughs. Great family entertainment. Brings back good ole wonderful memories back from the 70's.
3957,767001311,5,These videos are just as I expected and I'm enjoying watching them very much.
3958,767001311,5,Was an anniversary gift for my husband.  He loved it.
3959,767001311,5,Love it
3960,767001311,5,"Grew up watching The Bob Newhard Show every Saturday night with my family, wonderful to be able to enjoy the laughter all over again."
3961,767001311,3,Some disks will not play
3962,767001311,5,Newharts dry sense of humor is one of the many reasons the show is funny and entertaining
3963,767001311,5,great thanks
3964,767001311,5,"Love, love, love."
3965,767001311,5,Not much else to say but that it is one of the best classic shows on television.
3966,767001311,5,"THANK GOODNESS THEY FINALLY PUT THIS OUT.  I  have been waiting for years and years-- just crazy they wouldn't put the last seasons out!!  So-- I'm very glad to have been able to order this finally.  An interesting thing I read-- I had wondered why they did such a sudden set change for the apartments.  I guess they thought the show had been cancelled and they took the set apart already and got rid of it-- then they were called back for one more year-- so they had to slap together a new set!  This is also why Bob isn't always physically present in every episode-- he had booked other gigs when he thought his show had been cancelled-- so they had to make due without him.  Kind of a sad way for what was a really great show to go off-- But there you have it.  (I don't think this is the strongest season of the show, btw, but if you love Bob, you're still going to love it.)"
3967,767001311,5,I've been waiting a long time for seasons 5 & 6. Glad to have them.
3968,767001311,3,Losing some steam and pooping out.  And episodes without Bob?  It was time to call it a day.  And back then I believed they had already.  Didn't know it was still on that year at the time.
3969,767001311,5,"Loving my new Bob Newhart Show DVDs.  This show is a classic gem and is one of my favorites. Great cast, great acting and the humor is timeless. You won't be disappointed."
3970,767015525,5,Good.
3971,767015525,5,Good movie. Shipped fast.
3972,767015525,3,Patrick McNee has a bit part in this film. Reason enough to have a copy.  The movie tried to add too much of the quirks old series that made it  campy. This DVD has the version that was in the theaters.
3973,767015525,1,I cannot believe Sean Connery would put himself into such a horrible film
3974,767015525,4,Great guilty pleasure movie for fun viewing or to just make fun of
3975,767015525,5,cool
3976,767015525,4,One of the coolest TV shows from a time when there was something on that didn't insult your intelligence.
3977,767015525,5,Sit back and enjoy this fun reboot.  It is much better than most give it credit.  Perfect casting.
3978,767015525,1,Pretty weak plot
3979,767015525,4,This is a very fun movie. I love the characters.
3980,767001311,5,One of my favorite shows. Very Satisfied. Thanks.
3981,767001311,1,"Eh, I liked the episode when Emily goes camping with Bob's father and maybe a couple of other episodes with her, but I was not amused with his patients and since Bob wasn't in a few of the last episodes very much you could tell he had lost interest.  I would not buy this again and I wouldn't watch the shows over and over again.  After watching maybe two episodes twice I tried to sell the set and Amazon wouldn't let me because I don't have my account set up to have Amazon stock the items for sale.  So the videos are just sitting in a cabinet."
3982,767001311,5,Loved it.
3983,767001311,5,"Was a present for my father and it was one of his favorite gifts. We weren't able to find the show on Amazon Prime, Netflix or Hulu so this was the next best way to go and it really is a hilarious show!"
3984,767001311,2,Some DVDs disc didn't work
3985,767001311,5,"I've waited a long time for the complete series, and I have not been disappointed! This is a treasure in my home! It's well packaged and a great improvement over the original release of seasons 1 through 4. Very happy to finally have them all, and in one collection!"
3986,767001311,2,"Cheap packaging, but happy to have the last two seasons on dvd."
3987,767001311,5,excellent
3988,767001311,5,It's Bob Newhart...what's not to love?
3989,767001311,3,"The final season was a let down.  Not particularly funny.  You can tell Bob didn't really want to do it (he admits on the special features).  And he's missing from several episodes, out supposedly promoting a book.  DVD quality is good.  Just the shows aren't great."
3990,767015525,3,"Was ok, the sound did not work on my blue ray/ streaming content player"
3991,767015525,4,"The plot was a little strange, but overall it was a good movie. Loved Ralph Fiennes!!!"
3992,767015525,5,"After renting the movie I wanted it for my library. By movie standards it isn't Oscar material, however, it was fun and I totally love Ralph Fiennes in this one."
3993,767015525,1,Good actors did a bad job in a movie that makes no sense.
3994,767015525,3,"Uma incredible, the rest of the cast and plot not so much."
3995,767015525,3,Definitely not up to the standards of the TV series. Ralph Fiennes is a second rate John Steed. Uma Thurman is a little better as Emma Peele but making her an expert in every science is a little much. Having two people running the agency is too much. Having the man code named Mother and the woman code named Father is too cute by far.
3996,767015525,5,Great Transaction! Awesome Merchandise!
3997,767015525,5,I've been an Avengers fan since 1966 when it first aired in the U.S. This last of the Avengers' sets is as entertIning as the rest. The digital remastering makes it look better than it did when I watched it originally. We were very happy with this set.
3998,767015525,1,Wow! This is a terrible movie!
3999,767015525,3,perfect
4000,767001311,5,It is a gift for my husband
4001,767001311,5,Look great and sound good.....the final season....tv isn't this cool anymore
4002,767001311,5,Finally! I love this show!
4003,767001311,5,"Great series, great comedian."
4004,767001311,5,"This show is one of the classics: it's humor is hip, intelligent, sometimes surreal. the cast is absolutely perfect. With so little sit-com type shows on tv these days, do yourself a favor and invest in this for many hours of feel-good comedy."
4005,767001311,5,Got this for my father and he Loved it.  He still watches it!
4006,767001311,5,Now we have them all.
4007,767001311,5,The show speaks for itself. The package and disc setup is good
4008,767001311,4,"Bob Newhart's trademark dry humor shines throughout the show's sixth and final season (although Newhart's frequent absence by mid-season, due to other filming obligations, doesn't go unnoticed).

Aside from Bob and Emily's move to a new apartment (because apparently the old one wasn't ""spacious"" enough!) and then magically having Howard move into a neighboring apartment (which is never actually explained - Howard just resumes his regular routine of barging in every day) the season continues much as before. Bob meets regularly with his clients, particularly the infamous Mr. Carlin; he and Emily socialize with Howard, Carol, Jerry and others. Although plot-wise there is little that is truly unique or surprising, the show still works. The actors' chemistry, Bob's traditional straight-man shtick against the blundering Howard or goofy Jerry, the ridiculous statements of Mr. Carlin (all delivered in deadpan) continue to amuse and entertain."
4009,767001311,5,Finally! I've been waiting a long time for this season of The Bob Newhart Show!
4010,767015525,1,I only watch this because of a podcast. Thanks hdtgm
4011,767015525,1,Should have rented it first! One of the worst movies I've ever seen!
4012,767015525,5,dvd in good shape if you love the avengers you will love this.  linda thorson as tara king every bit as good as dianna rig as mrs peel.  one of the best tv shows ever made
4013,767015525,3,Good movie and will watch again.
4014,767015525,1,I couldn't view it as it is the wrong region.
4015,767015525,1,"This was the biggest bomb

there are only 1 Emma Peel and 1 John Steed,,,,Diana Rigg and Patrick MacNee  RIP

next time you want to try a film.....based on series use them which can be no longer done RIP PATRICK MAGNEE  and forget the hacks"
4016,767015525,5,Exactly what I expected!
4017,767015525,5,Loved it!!!
4018,767015525,4,no comment
4019,767015525,1,"Good lord, what was that horror I just watched?"
4020,767001311,5,Excellent
4021,767001311,5,"You simply must have this series.  You'll want to watch it again, and again.  Great Bob....thanks for your timeless humor.  Dave (in Colorado)"
4022,767001311,1,"This season felt like they ran out of ideas for shows.  The acting was off, as if they all had ""Senioritis"" and weren't really focused on the last season.  Bob was barely present in this season."
4023,767001311,5,Great TV classic.
4024,767001311,5,"I received the dvds on time, and in great shape. As for the content of the dvds, I was surprised by how little Bob was in the episodes in this last season. I didn't remember that from when it was on tv. It is still an excellent show, and I'm very glad to finally have this entire series in my collection. Thank you Mr. Newhart."
4025,767001311,5,Love Bob Newhart. My mom watches her new CDs every night.
4026,767001311,5,FAVORITE SHOW OF ALL TIME...BRINGS ME BACK TO MY CHILDHOOD
4027,767001311,5,Still funny after all these years. Takes you back to a simpler time when humor didn't involve profanity. Always have and always will enjoy this show.
4028,767001311,5,Best season of this show. Finally it is available on its own.
4029,767001311,3,"These old Bob Newhart shows don't have the quality of writing or wit of ""Frasier""  or ""Everyone loves Raymond.""That being said, it was fun seeing the styles and designs from the era."
4030,767015525,5,Great
4031,767015525,4,Great movie.
4032,767015525,2,Dumb!!!
4033,767015525,4,"While not entirely true to the classic TV series, this movie is very true to the theme of an ultra-British spy spoof.  The villain's house is VERY well-appointed, and the heroes have an interesting way of crossing the Thames to go after him.  It's just too bad that the film makes for a tricky search, with all the Marvel superhero films showing up.  It's worth finding!"
4034,767015525,5,love it
4035,767015525,5,Jolly good show!
4036,767015525,3,"This movie has been thouroughly torpedoed by critics and audiences alike - fuelled, no doubt, by the severe lashings Mr. Connery himself doled out during post-production. But while there's plenty reason to dislike it (a plot petering out in an insipid ending, misuse of Mr. Fiennes' acting qualities, discontinuities in the filming, etc etc), there's even more to enjoy, in a camp sort of way.
The scene with Connery in teddybear-disguise is a hilarious spoof of James Bond's Spectre-meetings, some of the Dali-esque setpieces are intruiging and in general the whole film is so outrageously ridiculous that you won't gain anything by missing it, to say the least. Comparisons with the original, authentic, masterly Avengers-tv-series (with Patrick MacNee and Diana Rigg) shouldn't be made - the film doesn't stand up to it and if it purports to do so, it's its major weakness. It's just entertaining - more than the weaker entries in the Bond-saga, of which there are several. Particularly neglected (in my opinion) are the hallucinatory opening credits in which Joel McNeely's music blends exceedingly well."
4037,767015525,5,GREAT COMPLETLY
4038,767015525,5,"don't listen to critics, watch and enjoy!!!"
4039,767015525,1,"As a major fan of the original series I watched this move about 15 years ago and hated it. Today I thought maybe I was in a bad mood that day, but no, it is that horrid. There simply is nothing here. A pathetic Steed for sure. It is all imitative and it fails. There is no plot. After seeing it twice I still have no clue who Sean Connery was supposed to be or what it was all about. The Emma Peel clone is pure stupidity and just wastes all the screen time. I can't understand why anybody thought anybody would like this. Complete failure."
4040,767001311,4,I used to be able to watch it on nick at nite sometimes when I was supposed to be in bed for school now I can watch it all of the time. Yay!
4041,767001311,5,"GREAT
GREAT
GREAT"
4042,767001311,5,Perfect!!! Arrived on the day you said it would! Thank you.
4043,767001311,5,Good show featuring the very funny Bob Newhart. This completes my collection and will be enjoyed as part of a marathon.
4044,767001311,5,"Love this original series...great cast, fun writing, and good acting.  No Bob Newhart fan should do without this series!"
4045,767001311,5,One of the best investments made.
4046,767001311,5,"Enjoying the series, very funny."
4047,767001311,5,"I grew up watching this sitcom. Bob Newhart is one of the best comedians!! His delivery is just so smooth. It was awesome to see the old gang again. I know he went on to some other shows, but this one is classic! Marcia Wallace;  Peter Bonerz; Suzanne Pleshette and the supporting cast mates are going to live on for ever!!"
4048,767001311,1,Love this show and have the first 4 seasons. These last two seasons are very poor - picture quality is marginal and sound is very poor. These are not the same quality recordings as the first 4 seasons.
4049,767001311,4,"There are some technical issues with this set: episodes black out on rare occasions and I'm not sure why they can't just present classic television shows in 4:3 aspect ratio- powers-that-be always have to mess with it.

The writing/acting/directing and most importantly cast chemistry is top notch."
4050,767001311,5,Just what I expected.
4051,767001311,5,Finally!!!
4052,767001311,5,"One of the greatest TV shows of all-time! Love Bob! Great cast! Great writing! Funny, funny, funny!"
4053,767001311,5,none
4054,767001311,5,one of the most original cast of characters
4055,767001311,5,Owned first 4 seasons on standalone dvd season sets. When Bob was MIA season 5 mid way and season 6 mostly....the humor was a struggle to keep excitement as high in the series.  It reinforced why this sitcom lost steam when it's main star was absent. Like extras. But this series jumped the sharp tail end of season 5.
4056,767001311,5,Love Bob Newhart and this show.  Still needs subtitles or captioning for us seniors and veterans.
4057,767001311,5,It's nice to be transported back to the 1970's with Bob Newhart show.
4058,767001311,1,Very poor quality. Lots of skips. Off air recordings it appears.
4059,767001311,5,We love this show!
4060,767015525,4,"Love this movie. Its not like the tv show, and its hokey. But..."
4061,767015525,1,Misfire steel
4062,767015525,4,"A bit goofy, and not like the series but well in the spirit."
4063,767015525,4,Good movie!
4064,767015525,4,"An awesome action adventure. Creative and involving. Sean Connery delivers a great performance as Sir August DeWynter, an maniacal genius and former British Intelligence agent (?) with an axe to grind with the Royal Empire. He has stolen control of a satellite that allows him to control the weather everywhere on the planet. He is holding the world hostage and has a hefty ransom. So British super agent John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) is called into action to stop him, and he is first advised to bring in Dr. Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), a noble prize winning physicist and the number one suspected ally of DeWynter after video footage of her surfaces implicating her in the murder of a high ranking member of the British business community. After he brings her in to meet Mother and Father, they determine she is innocent. But if so, then who is the woman on the video? They decide to team up to get some answers, and start at the home of Sir August DeWynter, where they quickly discover who their enemy is. But he is ready for their every move, and has them both at his mercy in a hurry. But they also soon discover he has a friend on the inside who gave him vital information to help him steal the weather satellite. A mole in British Intelligence. But who? This a exciting and involving action film that has every bit of the charm and charisma of the popular 60's TV series, and all the gadgets as well. It gets a 90's update, of course, but still keeps true to the show at the same time. Thurman and Fiennes have great onscreen chemistry, and as I mentioned, Connery was awesome. The idea of him being a former British agent was a bit cheesy, but still worked well. Brief nudity and mild language are all parents will have to worry about. There's a ton of action and snappy banter, as well as tea. Their was no sequel, which I felt was unfortunate. It didn't exactly kill at the box office, which might be its only downfall. I found it enjoyable and fun."
4065,767015525,5,Received as expected.
4066,767015525,4,"I love the Avengers,  Although I like Emma Peel more than Tara King. I would like to buy more 68 volumes but they are priced to high. I am hoping they come out with a whole 1968 package for a reasonable price."
4067,767015525,5,I've always loved this movie!
4068,767015525,4,"Quite a few reviews were pretty negative.  I found the film not great but a clever parody.  Opening art work was a 'take-off' of all the ""007"" openings.  Don't look for an action flick tho it has that.  Enjoy the subtulties, the double meanings, and the wit.

I don't usually watch videos a 2nd time but this could be one that I do.  Just to enjoy the clever playing against each other."
4069,767015525,5,OK
4070,767015525,5,Good DVD condition
4071,767015525,5,Wonderful movie.
4072,767015525,3,A bit dull but Ralph makes it exciting!
4073,767015525,3,It was as I remembered it with Tara King.( Good).
4074,767015525,5,"I find it bizarre how poor so many of the reviews of this movie are.  I love this movie, I've seen it half a dozen times over the years, and I just saw it again, now.

The characters are not robust, and their motivations are shallow.  The script is rather vapid.  The scenes and storyline don't make great logical sense.  But who the heck cares?  This movie doesn't try to make sense, and it KNOWS that it lacks structure and that its characters are in some ways ""silly.""  Not only does it acknowledge these characteristics, but it revels in them.  It takes joy in presenting something fantastical - without strong structure - that is purely over-the-top.

Sean Connery wears a Teddy Bear suit and throws darts.  Ralph Fiennes fights with an umbrella.  Uma Thurman has fight scenes in a hot air balloon, in which the villain is also Uma Thurman.  Jim Broadbent chain-smokes, eats macaroons, and is always in very odd-looking surroundings.  Lightning kills someone and tosses him into the sky.  Giant mechanical bugs shoot at cars.  There are millions of lovely, wonderful, fun images throughout the movie.  The script is borderline witty (but not really), but it certainly sounds nothing like real people talking, and it's fun to escape from reality for a while.  What the heck is not to like?

If you accept this movie for what it is - for what it acknowledges it is and loves itself for being - then you should enjoy it a great deal.

I think everyone fights it too much, wants it to be something that it never tries to be.  What it is - what it tries to be - is so much very, very fun, in itself.  Just don't fight it, expecting plot, coherence, etc.  Let it be.

Granted, I have never seen the original Avengers TV series.  Does that mean that I can't judge the movie?  I think I can.  I can enjoy the movie for what it is, rather than for how it compares to an older television series."
4075,767015525,5,"Wow, this flick is one of my all-time favs! I don't think I have ever seen anything quite like it. Outstanding - if they had a six star rating, I would give it that. Superb. And OMG, I am in love with Uma Thurman. Heavy, heavy sigh......."
4076,767015525,1,This movie was so bad that I decided to close my eyes and sleep rather than keep watching it.  Beyond bad.
4077,767015525,3,"I am a fan of the original television show the Avengers. Emma Peel, obviously but even more, Tara King.
I know the movie is religiously panned by reviewers but I am not a purest in respect to most beloved television.
This movie is incredibly light and absurd. It is not like the television series in anyway, to my mind at least. it contained the elements but they were performed and presented differently so I take them as they are given. For what it is this movie is an enjoyable bit of fun for an otherwise lazy afternoon stuck at home."
4078,767015525,2,"Seeing Sean Connery in such a silly role is kind of worth it just as proof that it actually happened. Otherwise, I was surprised to see that Eddie Izzard is in this as well but is completely wasted as they gave him only one line in the entire movie - come on, he is a stand-up comedian!

Anyway, silly story, not greatly acted, and sub-par pacing makes this one to avoid for the most part."
4079,767015525,5,"Always liked this movie and wanted my own copy of it, finally got around to buying it.  Good quality DVD, plays well."
4080,767001311,5,"I LOVE the Bob Newhart Show and this is the Best Set Yet, includes every show & interviews at a great price! The Bob Newhart Show was in my opinion the Funniest show on T.V. Yet there was no sex, no foul language , nothing vulgar or insulting, not like ever other show on television today. The cast was perfect!  I love all the kooky patients, Mr. Carlin, Michelle & especially Mr. Vickers!  Love Carol, Howard & Jerry, and all produced in front of a live studio audience. Thank you Bob & Emily for many years of pleasure & many years to come thanks to this Fab Box Set!"
4081,767001311,5,ok
4082,767001311,5,Great Show Very Funny
4083,767001311,5,shout factory knows how to produce a great DVD
4084,767001311,5,"This is one of the classic series from the 1970's and you are sure to enjoy it.  I also clearly remember  playing a drinking game we came up with whilst watching the show.  Anytime someone said ""Hi Bob"" you had to take a drink."
4085,767001311,5,The Bob Newhart show is always a winner no matter that it is now many decades later.  The humor is still fresh today.
4086,767001311,4,"Good quality recording, audio a little fuzzy (5th season).  The very loud first screen on each disc (shows a countdown) could be done without."
4087,767001311,4,"I wish there were half stars available because this set is not quite good enough for 4 stars but too good for 3.
As others have said, this last season isn't as funny as previous seasons and Bob Newhart is away for many of the episodes. With that said, a mediocre episode of The Bob Newhart show is still better than most of what's on TV these days. I would give the content of this season 4 stars but, as much as I hate to say it, the quality of many of the transfers on many of these episodes only deserves a 3 and some less than that. I can handle grainy but a couple of episodes are so washed out that everything in the scene looks sepia toned and the colors are barely there.
So, I agree that this season is a must for those of us who have been waiting to complete our individual sets and appreciate Bob Newhart in any form, but the quality isn't quite up to previous seasons."
4088,767001311,5,Bob Newhart jokes are timeless.  The show is just as funny now as it was then
4089,767001311,4,"Everyone's glad the final season of this venerable classic finally came out on home video as a stand-alone release, so hurrah for  the completists!  That said, despite some fine moments, the show begins to look tired in this season. Right away, the Hartleys move -- but only to an apartment on a different floor! So nothing really is changed except the decor and some of the off-screen layout. Howard is still THERE all the time, which becomes more and more ridiculous (even the new title sequence seems to poke fun at this) and I swear he  was made dumber and dumber as the series went on, resulting by season six  in a Howard Borden man-child personna  who is no longer a believable adult character (this man is a navigator for an airline?!?).  The plotlines and stories seem a bit shop-worn and many episodes near the end of the run  just trail off without any big topper or clear resolution.  Finally, and most unforgivable, Bob seems to be literally phoning in his appearances to the point of hardly even showing up in many episodes. Was it a sarcastic message to viewers,  how often the token Bob Newhart scene in a host of episodes is him on the phone in an airport or hotel, checking in with Emily?  Three minutes of Bob doesn't even allow for a decent ""Hi, Bob"" drinking game!

Even the finale is very abrupt and undeveloped, and then, that's all folks.  Kind of a wheeze-out for a show that in its prime was the sharpest written sit-com on television and still one of the best of all time.  Season Six is not the place to begin for newbies, but once you've watched this far, you might as well collect 'em all."
4090,767015525,2,"This movie had some plusses going for it, primarily the cast.  A lot of money was spent on the production design and special effects, but the film suffers from a misconceived premise.  First of all, it's dealing with a witty, effervescent spy romp -- an iconographical series of the 60's -- but it tries to turn it into a darker, insupportable James Bondian (same production designer).  ""Dark"" and the Avengers don't really mix.  The whole production is dark, lots of crashing special effects, derring do, conflict between ""Father"" and ""Mother"" which is never explained.  The dialogue is hard to understand and captioning is not provided on the streaming version.  A problem.  Other elements in the script are also confusing--the Emma Peel imposter, rationale, etc.  The direction is just leaden and that's fatal to this type of film."
4091,767015525,4,This is a great movie enjoyed it all the way I need to figure out how to download it into my library...
4092,767015525,1,What an awful movie!  It reached a climax and then went another 20 minutes.  Uma Thurmond doesn't have the charisma of Diana Riggs.
4093,767015525,3,"Ralph Feinnes and Uma Thurmond gave a workmanlike performance in this show.  It had a copule of nods to the original series, with Patrick McNee playing the invisible archivist and the show ending with the original Avengers theme. The overall flavor of the performance was more like Jame Bon, with the constant sexual innuendo (a crutch for mediocre writers) and less intelligent dialogue than the original."
4094,767015525,3,"Umbrella.  Guest star cameos from the original Avengers.  Didn't think that whole
Mother/Father thing connected with North American audiences, wrong cultural messages.

Teddy bear suits."
4095,767015525,1,"I wanted to like this, but it was awful. The cast is full of actors I like, and I enjoyed the original series, but this is just horrible and incomprehensible. Nothing makes sense, the dialogue is stodgy even though it is trying to pretend it's witty banter, and I was really sad that they made Steed and Peel have a romantic relationship. This is a movie that managed to use Eddie Izzard to not be funny. So terribly disappointing."
4096,767015525,5,Yeah I loved the movie version of Avengers with Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes Sean Connery had a great part also as Sir August dewinter.
4097,767015525,1,"Pure garbage, I will not waste any more words on this cinematic rubbish. Do yourself a major favor if you have been brave enough to watch this crap all the way through,immediately afterwards watch an original ""The Avengers"" episode it will help cleanse your soul!"
4098,767015525,5,"The actors made the movie. I am a very big fan of the original TV series. I think they did the series proud. Sometimes movies from tv series are not very good, but not this time. I was very pleased."
4099,767015525,4,"I got this to replace an old vhs copy, love it! Sometimes the oldies really are the ones to watch!"
4100,767001311,5,Love Bob Newhart in his classic 70's sitcom!
4101,767001311,5,I'm so excited to own the whole series. I love this show and highly recommend to all fans of it to buy this set.
4102,767001311,5,I love this show i can't say that enough! I have watched it over and over and still laugh. Great dvd set
4103,767001311,5,Remarkable quality sound and video.  This show takes me back to junior high.
4104,767001311,5,Just because I don't write a comprehensive review doesn't mean my rating is less important.
4105,767001311,5,I'm not old enough to remember the early years of the show I vaguely remember the later seasons so I only really became familiar w/watching it in syndication so I was elated when the complete series was finally released on DVD. Its one of those shows the more you watch it the funnier it gets. Also glad to see Bob Newhart is not one of celebrities that have decided to rest on his laurels the mans in his mid eighties and still tours!
4106,767001311,1,"As with many others I duplicated the first four seasons to get the last two; this after waiting for a year for the individual seasons 7 & 8 on preorder. Seasons 7 & 8 were not ""cleaned up"" as were the first 4 seasons. I see that they have finally released the last 2 seasons individually. I would love to know if they are the same as the set or if they are like the first 4 seasons."
4107,767001311,4,"Corny, but funny."
4108,767001311,5,prompt delivery and as described
4109,767001311,5,"The Bob Newhart Show was scheduled to end after Season 5, but luckily for us the cast and crew signed up for one last round.

To be honest, Season 6 is less funny than its predecessors, but still worth watching. Bob Newhart literally ""phoned it in"" for several episodes (due to other filming commitments) but his phone routines are always top notch anyway.

Those of us who waited YEARS for Seasons 5 and 6 to be released can thank Shout! Factory for taking over the series. They did a good job with the packaging and the film and sound reproduction is very good for a 1970s transfer.

(Note the new apartment in Season 6; the old set was dismantled when the studio assumed the show was over. I miss the old set!)"
4110,767015525,5,I love the show and have the whole series. It and myself are oldies but goodies. Very Camp and for its day original. One of the first British made shows to be a hit in a the USA.
4111,767015525,3,Guess I just liked the tv series too much. The movie isn't that bad I just kept comparing it to memories.
4112,767015525,1,"I like British stuff. I like spies...but this movie kept putting me to sleep; however, there was this one bit where they were driving a convertible and pressed a button on the dash and hot tea came out of the tap. They drank it from actual cups and saucers while going down the road. When the credits started rolling, I realized that Voldemort had been in it...Ralph Fiennes as John Steed. Sean Connery was also in it. I do like his voice."
4113,767015525,1,I am embarrassed to say I watched 35 minutes of this ghastly movie hoping that it would get better.  Save yourself...do NOT bother with this mess.
4114,767015525,2,"This has got to be one of the worse movies ever. Especially since the elements to make an interesting movie were already there. Story. Characters. They even had decent actors. The dialogue was terrible.

But there is something strangely benign about it. It doesn't make you angry. It lulls you. To sleep. Sometimes that's not a bad thing.

I have several movies I put on that put me right to sleep. This is one of them. Maybe it's the low droning sound that is the characters speaking. Worth the $3 used I think I paid.

Fargo puts me to sleep too. Something about the snow."
4115,767015525,5,"In the Nineties it was fashionable for Hollywood to adapt popular television series for the big screen the best being ""The Fugitive"" and the very worst, in my mind, ""Lost In Space"".  There were high hopes riding on ""The Avengers"" in the Summer of 1998 with a dream cast of Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, and the iconic Sean Connery.  Things didn't bode well for the film when the film's release date kept getting pushed back.  Things looked even worse when the film wasn't even previewed for the critics and naturally the daggers were drawn when it was seen and the public followed suit.  I saw it in the theatre and was disappointed because it didn't meet my expectations.  But what were my expectations?  Is this a bad film because it isn't the film I thought it should be?  I don't know why I revisited ""The Avengers"" but I'm glad I did.  Common criticisms of the film at the time are these.  Fiennes as John Steed and Thurman as Emma Peel had no chemistry.  Connery as Sir August De Wynter was lackluster as the villain.  London, a bustling city, is oddly bereft of people.  Eddie Izzard as one of Connery's henchmen has no dialogue which is strange for a man who makes his living as a stand-up comic.  For the first two criticisms I'll say the critics are dead wrong.  For the second two I'll say that the makers of the film were making an ironic stab at comedy that may have gone over some people's heads.  Viewing this film unbiased by the criticisms at the time of it's release I'll say it's chief virtues are not only Fiennes, Thurman, and Connery but also terrific supporting work by Jim Broadbent, Fiona Shaw, and Eileen Atkins. Patrick MacNee also has a decent cameo.  The film has decent production values and special effects but they're secondary to some cheeky dialogue notably between Fiennes and Thurman.  It's rare that I do a 180 on a film but that's the case here.  This film may have its detractors but if you go into it with an open mind you may find delight in ""The Avengers""."
4116,767015525,1,"Just a terrible movie.  Quite possibly the worst Uma Thurman has been involved in.  Rating it on its own merits, it's not that bad of a movie-- just kind of silly and dumb and totally forgettable.  Comparing it to the Peel-era shows is what makes this very hard to watch.  First of all, Uma Thurman looks nothing like Diana Rigg.  Jessica Biel would make a much better Emma Peel.  Secondly, this is set in modern day.  So much of Peel's persona has to do with how she twirls her flip or wearing those white gloves.  Without that hair and clothing goes much of the essence of Emma Peel.  Sealing the tomb is a barrage of crappo CGI which makes the whole thing look like the graphics on a fast food cup set to motion.  For a dumb film of a similar flavor which actually succeeds at being a comedy, just rent ""Austin Powers""."
4117,767015525,1,"Dear God!  Did this movie suck ass!  Even Sean Connery's entire coolness couldn't save it!  Unlike Highlander 2, his scenes were some of the worst!  If you can get thru the ""Teddy Bear"" scene, you are a better man than I!"
4118,767015525,5,"I love this movie it is so funny and I wanted to get it so my kids could enjoy it as well. they liked it too, its great when a show is funny enough and timeless enough to engage all the family no matter the age and gender. we love to sit around and watch movies together and this is a great addition to our collection."
4119,767015525,5,"I love watching Uma and Ralph in the Avengers.  You have to be a real devotee of the first Avengers to enjoy this new Avengers!

I think both actors a perfect for their roles.  That idiot that talked about Ralph's bowler being to small, needs watch all the old Avenger shows to see how they acted and then maybe when you rewatch the new Avengers you'll have a clue.

I loved it and have watched it over and over again!  So if you don't love it, you're clueless!"
4120,767001311,5,Excellent experience.
4121,767001311,5,"Still one of the classic sitcoms.  It of the 70s but the humor remains tweaked enough for the modern audience.  Bob is a master of the reaction shot and the others (special call out to the late Marcia Wallace) are comedy greats in their own right.

It's a pity that The Bob Newhart Show isn't better known by the younger generation.  It broke a lot of new ground in putting off beat comedy and characters on TV.  This collection presents the series in appropriate fashion with commentary by many of the cast and director/producers.

Highly recommended"
4122,767001311,4,"Video quality is not a good as the first four seasons, but is outweighed by FINALLY having the entire series here at home."
4123,767001311,5,Great show love having the whole series great condition.
4124,767001311,5,still is funny after all these years.
4125,767001311,5,Bob Newhart one of the best!
4126,767001311,5,"It's the final season of The Bob Newhart Show, what more needs to be said. I'm happy to finally being able to finish the set."
4127,767001311,5,"Great Series love it, I'm glad they came out with the complete series, don well."
4128,767001311,5,"Bought it as a gift. The feedback has been very good. I am told this is a legendary sitcom second to none. Based on the clips I have watched, this appears to be the case. I hope to borrow the collection some day or get one for myself."
4129,767001311,5,A+
4130,767015525,4,"I watched all The Avengers way back when, and own all of them now. As John Steed and Emma Peel, Patrick McNee and Diana Rigg are and probably always be irreplaceable and unsurpassable.

Should you watch/get this movie? Depends. Can you accept that Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman, as Steed and Peel, are not McNee and Riggs, and are not trying to imitate the TV actors? That, as with King Lear, different actors can bring different qualities, different interpretations, to a role? If you can, yes, get this movie. Fiennes is diffident, where McNee was suave. Thurman is titillating, where Rigg was provocative. Some of the movie is silly; so was some of the TV show. (And remember, The Avengers was picked up by US TV not because it was good, but because it was the 60s, it had spies - and it was cheaper than making a show in the States.)

This will never be the definitive The Avengers. But if you have an open mind, give it a look. Better (IMHO) than another couple of hours with another 'reality' show. Then, if you haven't, watch McNee and Rigg too. And if you have, watch them again, after some well-spent time with Fiennes and Thurman."
4131,767015525,3,"The 60s' Brit TV show was never one of my faves. It was a low-budget James Bond spoof, which Bond itself was as a spoof of Cold War spies in general,, though not low-budget. Here, despite three big name stars, the film never quite takes off, seeming instead like nothing so much as a, well, high-budget TV show. In the 60s, the sexual tension between agent John Steed and Mrs. Peel was highly suggestive stuff. Today, it seems quaint, almost literary. Never mind the plot here. It's a mishmash of more Bond crossed with Lord of the Rings special effects. Some mumbojumbo about a megalomaniac controlling the weather. The whole point of this movie is archness. Sometimes it works and often it's just tedium. Watch if there is nothing else."
4132,767015525,5,"The product was as advertised, delivered quickly and fairly priced.  What's not to like?"
4133,767015525,1,"Combine the worst elements of Wild Wild West and Batman & Robin and you get this god-awful mess of a film that's as confused tonally as it is made poorly. And made poorly it is. The score is over-blown & barely fits within a scene, the dialogue is atrocious, the acting is embarrassing to all involved, the plot is convoluted as all get out, and there isn't a single genuinely good moment to be found.

First off, tone. I've never been more baffled as to what the filmmakers were going for than I was with this film. It didn't really strike me as serious, but it never struck me as a comedy or a parody either, or even campy. I've never seen the TV series, but my god, I don't think it had people dressing up in Teddy bear costumes! That's right, Sean Connery, and a bunch of other people in a board room wear teddy bear suits. Why? So they don't know who each other is. Why teddy bear suits? I have no earthly idea. In a way, it's sort of charming in the way ""Toys"" was with Robin Williams and that crazy world, but any charm is zapped by the utter incomprehensibility injected scene, after scene, after painful scene. Sean Connery gets a cane stuck through him, then lightning comes down, zaps him, and then carries him up. Why didn't this lightning bolt strike before? I mean, Sean Connery had the cane with him the whole time.

Then there's the casting. Forget the fact that this is basically Mr. Freeze with weather puns instead of ice puns, and it's being said by the great Sean Connery, the real offender of this film is Uma Thurman. Yes, Uma was in Batman & Robin also, so bad picking skills on her part, but my gosh is she miscast. The actress is from Boston, but the character is from England, and speaks in an English accent, and boy does it show. Oh wait, she also gets to fight her clone named ""Evil Peel,"" and gets to say the line, ""You just saved me from myself."" Yes, that's actual dialogue from this movie. And that's one of the ""funnier"" lines. As for Ralph Fiennes, I don't believe he's actually in the film. It's actually Joseph in Ralph's face, because that's the quality he puts into this. Granted, his character basically gets to fight with umbrellas, drink tea, and speak in a polite British accent, but my gosh, put a little emotion into it!

It's rumored that 50 minutes was cut out of this film right before release, sacrificing a lot of the coherentness to make it a bad movie. Believe me, it was always a bad movie. There's no amount of extra scenes that could make this even a decent movie. It's at its core a bad film. What, are you going to have dialogue explaining why Steed & Peel come to Wynter's fortress in plastic bubbles? Are you going to have dialogue explaining the need to create mechanical bees? The list goes on and on, and in the end, it would have just prolonged the awfulness. As is, it's too long. So stay away from these Avengers at all costs, and go watch those other Avengers. God only knows that a bunch of superheros is more believable and entertaining than those British spies."
4134,767015525,4,"I don't know what all the fuss is about.  This is a fun and stylish homage to the great TV series of the 60's.

I can't imagine any harder task than to try to compete with Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg, and face the inevitable comparisons.  No mean task, to be sure, and a brave one.  But Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are wonderful.  Of course, there are many parallels in their characterizations, but they still manage to create their own style and chemistry.  With the back-up of great supporting actors and a witty, caustic script, they make the characters and story their own.

Jim Broadbent is brilliant as Mother.  The sets are superb.  The CGI is well done, and not phony-looking.  Sean Connery is devilish.  The story is clever.

I am only sorry to that hear the producers, in response to so much negativity, cut the film a great deal.  It is edited beautifully, but I would love to see it as originally designed."
4135,767015525,1,"I can't remember the last time I turned a movie off out of sheer boredom.  When my daugher is watching Elmo's Potty Time, even that show is able to hold my attention for the entire program.

Seriously - I tried to watch this movie on two different occasions and it failed to make me want to watch it thru to it's conclusion both times.  I found myself distracted by the least little thing.  Watching a bird out the window, counting how many times the ceiling fan rotated every 60 seconds,  trying to determine if this number was constant or variable, if not constant then how many rotations did it vary per minute, was there a pattern to this variation,  what's for lunch,  blt sandwich maybe?  Bacon... mmmm... bacon.....

-sorry, back to the review.

I've never seen an episode of the original TV show so I didn't have the element of familiarity to help me out - but from what I've read in other reviews similarities between the TV show and this movie are few.

Some people may say that since I haven't watched the whole movie I have no right to give it a bad review.  I say the fact that I COULD NOT watch the whole thing speaks for itself."
4136,767015525,1,"Even though ten years older than myself, it is clear that director Jeremiah Chechik didn't have a clue as to what made the TV version a draw (Diana Rigg).  If you don't cast a Diana Rigg then forget doing a remake.  When Val Kilmer took on the role of ""The Saint"" it was casting agent Elisabeth Leustig and director Phillip Noyce (Clear and Present Danger, Patriot Games) that had the right stuff to revive a British staple of 60's television.  It should have been Noyce directing ""The Avengers-1998"" as well, coupled with another incredible music score of Graeme Revell.  I've no doubt it would have been DY-NO-MITE!  But it wasn't....not even close.  Keep your fingers crossed for the 2012 version."
4137,767015525,4,"I bought this movie in the $3 bin at a local discount store. I then read the reviews and thought I had been had. However, I actually liked this movie. Sean Connery as the bad guy and I found it very well done with excellent picture quality."
4138,767015525,5,"Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman and Academy Award winner Sir Sean Connery star in this big-screen adaptation of the popular 1960's television series which starred Honor Blackman, Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg. Unfortunately, a lot of scenes which were in the trailer were deleted from the film after what are rumored to be terrible test screenings, and in the end, we wind up with what looks like an action movie trailer for the real thing (please excuse me for using Ridley Scott's descrption of his own film ""Kingdom Of Heaven"" when talking about the Director's Cut). The original length of the movie is rumored to run aywhere from 115 minutes to 2/1/2 hours. Frankly, I LOVED the movie, but am left feeling cheated because the Director's Cut has not been released. Warner Bros. should plan to release it, as there is a fan base, however small, for this movie. Also, there's a narrative error caused by the editing down to 86-89 minutes-SPOILER AHEAD!!!-when infiltrating Sir August De Wynter's lair, how did the real Doctor Peel know the code words (""How now, brown cow?"") to get into the lair with John Steed, as the line is not heard in the film prior to the scene?-SPOILER OVER!!! I enjoyed the acting of everyone involved, but felt that Sean Connery was underused (and, judging by the trailer and information on another site, most of his scenes ended up on the cutting room floor). SPOILER ALERT!!! Patrick Macnee's cameo was good. I guess the reason he chose not to appear on screen (and why Ms. Rigg turned down a cameo in the film) is because they didn't want the cameos to distract the audience from the plot of the movie. It also would have been nice to see Honor Blackman, another Bond Girl, appear in the film as well. Trivia: Patrick Macnee also appeared in a Bond film: ""A View To A Kill."" PLEASE, somebody contact Warner Bros. & urge them to release the Director's Cut of this movie and the Director's Cut of
""Anna Karenina"" starring Sophie Marceau, Sean Bean, James Fox, Phyllida Law and Alfred Molina. This movie was initially rated PG, but upon the (ultimately stupid and late) decision to include brief rear male nudity and an ""F"" word (which were really not neccessary), was re-rated PG-13."
4139,767015525,5,"The cable movie rating was ONE STAR, but the names were fabulous. So I watched it. It may be the worst movie ever made, by the rating, but it is CERTAINLY one of the MOST ENJOYABLE ever seen.  It took a little research to discover that this was made after the successful TV series -- and then it dawned on me that they got the one star on purpose.  This is a fantastic ""send-up to the extreme"" of all the earlier ""spy movies"" and when watched with that in mind it was very enjoyable.  A must now for my collection."
4140,767001311,5,"Funny, love his humor"
4141,767001311,4,These are shows from my childhood that my husband & I will continue to watch -- over and over again.
4142,767001311,5,loved the show happy they finally released the final season
4143,767001311,5,How could anyone not love this DVD?  It was great!
4144,767001311,5,"Dry humor is an acquired taste, and if you're a fan of that kind of humor and a fan of Newhart, this is for you. Great banter among the characters, good Chicago references (there weren't many TV shows set in Chicago at that time) and situations that have held up surprisingly well over time make this an underrated show worth taking a look at. Too bad this show didn't last longer, but the cast and producers decided to go out while on top rather than wear out their welcome."
4145,767001311,3,"Fair quality DVD, that's it. Program material not in question!"
4146,767001311,5,"Finally got to see the ending of a wonderful series, as I missed it when it was on the air.  What a wonderful show."
4147,767001311,5,"Finally, after years of waiting the final season was released.

Now that I have the complete set, I can die in peace.

Oklahoma!"
4148,767001311,5,"Being a fan of Bob Newhart and living in the UK, we never got the opportunity to see his shows over here.
So its fantastic to be able to buy them on DVD, the sound and picture quality is very good, and Bob is as brilliant as ever."
4149,767001311,5,Terrific final season of a great TV comedy.
4150,767001311,5,Glad to finally have this show
4151,767001311,5,It arrived just as promised!  I love this show!
4152,767001311,4,"Great comedy, great cast, fast shipping by Amazon, everything good. So glad all the seasons of this very warm and funny comedy are finally available. No extras on this DVD, but that's OK. Now I'm waiting for them to release the rest of the Newhart series. Hope it's soon."
4153,767001311,5,Great classic sitcom finally on DVD!  Loved every episode!
4154,767001311,5,I have waited for 30+ years to view my favorite episode again. Worth the wait.
4155,767001311,5,"I can't really rate these videos yet, as we recently got the 5th Season and the Final Season. I'm sure we will enjoy it as much as we have the first 4 1/2 seasons. It is nice to have the complete run of this show, as we (my wife & I) feel this was Bob's best show with the funniest cast members!"
4156,767001311,5,"This completes the series , 1st rate"
4157,767001311,5,This collection is the best of Newhart. They just don't make TV like this anymore. Too bad. Wewould rather watch these than anything on TV today. Always a great laugh.
4158,767001311,5,"Bravo Shout! Factory for releasing seasons 5 and 6 for those of us who had been purchasing the individual seasons.  Great move. I'd like to mention that the video quality is excellent as well.

The Bob Newhart Show is one of those ""must have"" comedy classics.  I can't help but laugh at Bob's subtle, uptight, quirky humor, paired with Emily's playful goofiness.  A great tv marriage!  Then, when you add in the stellar grouping of zany friends and neurotic patients, it makes for hilarious episodes that we will never forget.  This is what comedy was meant to be and will never be again.  Highly recommend this series!"
4159,767001311,5,"Excellent series.  I'm watching it now, and it brings back so many memories.  I've even gotten my son to watch some of the episodes, and I catch him laughing though I think he didn't expect to find this funny.  Bob Newhart is a comic genius.  I would recommend this seller."
4160,767015525,5,"I know I'm in the minority, but I really did love this movie. I suspect one reason there was a negative reaction to this film was because many people missed the original series. The original series was before my time, so I had nothing to miss so to speak.

Moving on, the movie tries to create a 60s feeling, and to a great deal they succeed. We see John Steed gradually walk through a series of 'obstacles' to test his spy abilities. Uma Thurman and John Steed meet, and right away, we see that Uma Thurman does not always play by the established rules. We are lead to believe that Uma Thurman has sabotaged her own project, and of course we know that that is a little too obvious. So, Mrs Peel and John end up working together to find the real problem.

We then meet Sean Connery who carries some charm and is obviously very intelligent. But he shows his dark side as well. Moving on, we see that Connery's plan is to control the world with his weather controlling device. (Alright. A bit cliche. But this is a 60s recreation, so a bit of the cliche was probably inevitable.) Also worth mentioning is that all the nations of the government are fighting and bickering at the crucial moment and accomplishing nothing. Sean Connery walks in and announces his intentions to control the world. And of course they continue to argue and bicker uselessly. There is something utterly hilarious about how Sean Connery silences the politicians very simply: ""Oh...DO SHUT UP!""

I don't want to ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it. But there is a nice 60s charm; there is the right amount of action; the right amount of story; and a nice amount of internal trouble where we should feel safe; and the comedy is well balanced too. And the final showdown between John Steed and Sean Connery is very well done. Also worth mentioning is that John Steed and Mrs Peel work together well without stomping over each other.

Another character I feel obliged to mention is 'Mother.' Rather than being the cliche behind the scenes man, he seems to know that things aren't always what they seem; he is open to reason and the finding of the truth; and when he discovers the truth, he tries to save Mrs. Peel, even though he is old and injured. It's also worth mentioning that at one point he refuses to believe that Steed and Peel have simply vanished, and he sends out a rescue party. (The kind, benevolent, open to reason boss, who knows when he has to face the danger. And just the right touch of being fatherly.)

If you are expecting the original series, you're probably going to be disappointed. But if you are willing to see this in its own light, it's really a nice film. Also a great way to have a 60s night!

My advice is to at least give it a chance."
4161,767015525,3,"In an age of director's cuts and extended additions, the irony is that the films that need restoration the most are the very ones that never get it. Thus the Weinsteins chose not to restore The Fall of the Roman Empire, MGM/UA chose not only to ignore the existing four-hour rough-cut version of Tony Richardson's The Charge of the Light Brigade but actually put out a cut version of the theatrical version and the much-troubled 1998 movie version of The Avengers will never be seen as it was originally intended. It's not the catastrophe its often portrayed, but the studio only had themselves to blame for the over-reaction by violating the quid-pro-quo relationship with the press by not screening it for the critics, a public relations disaster that lead to many publications imposing a blacklist on articles about their films for months after and picking it as their turkey of the year.

Warner Bros. 75th anniversary year was certainly not good one, with flop after flop turning their planned celebrations into commiserations. Perhaps in any other year there would have been less pressure on trying to turn an always optimistically surreal cult item into a blockbuster despite increasingly bad word of mouth, but by the time it emerged from lengthy post-production, the film was covered from head to toe in self-inflicted wounds. What had started out with a two-hour plus running time went to a 101-minute compromise cut to a released version that ran only 81 minutes without credits with Michael Kamen's original score replaced by a quickie effort from Joel McNeely as they tried to unsuccessfully make it more conventional to an audience unfamiliar with the series while alienating the original fans. It's just a surprise they didn't try to edit it down further to the length of a TV episode - even the troubled movie version of The Saint only lost its last 20 minutes. In the process they simply turned an interesting misfire into a much shorter, more confusing misfire and ended up with something too surreal for mainstream audiences, and too mainstream for Avengers fans. (The BFI was offered the chance to screen and preserve the original cut in 1999, but all too typically blew it by not bothering to return the studio's calls!)

The loss of the original (and heavily trailered) opening was certainly a huge mistake. Instead of seeing Mrs Peel (or is it?) breaking into and destroying a weather station, something that triggers the plot (a variation on both the original show's A Surfeit of H20 and Our Man Flint with a weather-controlling eccentric millionaire holding the world to ransom), the film now opens with Steed taking on policemen, milkmen and machine-gun toting nannies with only his bowler and brolly - an enjoyable enough introductory scene but not as essential to understanding what's going on. That's just the first of many plot holes the film is left with, but they're still the least of the film's problems.

On the plus side, Ralph Fiennes wisely doesn't attempt a Patrick McNee impersonation as Steed, opting for a more formal, slightly reserved approach that lacks Macnee's effortless bonhomie but works well enough on its own terms. Jim Broadbent makes a good `Mother' and Eileen Atkins (in a cameo originally intended for Diana Rigg) effortlessly steals her few scenes. But if they're all on good form, just about everyone else isn't. Indeed, there's miscasting on an epic scale here - Fiona Shaw overacting for England yet again as `Father,' Eddie Izzard exuding all the menace of a fluffy kitten and Uma Thurman delivering a turn bad enough to make you sorry they didn't cast Elizabeth Hurley as Mrs Peel instead. You feel almost sorry for her and wonder how she ever got another job after this - she can't do comedy, she can't do the accent, she can't do sophisticated, she can't do the banter and most of her action scenes hit the cutting room floor, which reduces her to not much more than a clotheshorse. That there's absolutely no chemistry between her and Fiennes is just another nail in the coffin.

Sadly it's a performance more than matched by what originally seemed the film's great casting coup. Sean Connery, once again showing the keen commercial instinct that led him to turn down X-Men, Lord of the Rings and The Mask of Zorro, gives a career-worst performance in his first role as a villain since 1959's Tarzan's Greatest Adventure and 1984's Sword of the Valiant. Looking like Windsor Davies playing a dirty old man but without the restraint, his introductory single-entendre scene with Thurman is painful to watch as she flounders and he mistimes every line - it's the kind of thing you'd expect in a Robbie Moffat film where amateur actors only get one take and it goes in the picture whether they fluff it or not. It cannot be stressed enough just how absolutely awful he is for much of the film, and considering how often Connery's double stood in for him Peter Sellers-style even on non-action scenes because of the star's feuds with the director and producer (shades of LXG) you find yourself wondering if his better moments may not even be him.

There's a lot about it that's good - the teddy bear scene is spot on and worthy of the original show while Patrick McNee's cameo non-appearance is fun - and a lot that isn't - Roger Pratt's dour photography overcompensates for the primary colors of Stuart Craig's production design and Anthony Powell's costumes. Yet while it's a mess that often stops making sense thanks to the unsubtle re-editing, it's still surprisingly watchable, with just enough moments that do work and give a hint of what could have been to keep you soldiering on through the patches that fall flat. It's just a shame we'll probably never see the film the way it was originally intended to judge it on its own merits rather than the studio's second-guessing.

Not much in the way of extras here - just  a  trailer  and som e  text notes - though the disc does have an acceptable widescreen transfer."
4162,767015525,5,This dvd worked perfectly. It was simply missing the original case with cover art. I would definitely purchase more products from this seller.
4163,767015525,5,"A good simple ""escape"" film.  I have always found the photography on deserted London streets (or English country roads) intriguing."
4164,767015525,5,"Prior to 1967, ""The Avengers"" was yielded in black-and-white. Going to color was a definite improvement; however in 1968 there were three additional significant changes:

1. Mrs. Peel (Diana Rigg) was traded out for Steed's new partner, Tara King (Linda Thorson).

2. The producers asserted that the 1968 episodes were more [paraphrasing] ""believable"" -- in fact, just the opposite is true. The '68 episodes are more bizarre than ever, but still very good.

3. There is more involvement by Steed's boss, ""Mother"" (a wheelchair-bound chubby guy who shows up in very strange places to discuss Steed's progress on respective cases).

This DVD package, (2 DVDs, individually cased and further packaged in an attractive cardboard box, this ""Set No. 4"" color-coded RED), is the fourth of FIVE sets for the 1968 episodes. The marketing of ""The Avengers"" can be quite confusing so I wanted to get that information out up front. This is also the BEST way to buy the DVDs (by the ""set"" rather than by the ""volume"") for any season, from 1963 through 1968.

Patrick Macnee shrewdly plays John Steed, England's gentleman undercover agent. Linda Thorson is one of several of a line of Steed's voluptuous sidekicks. In the U.S., most of us didn't even know about Honor Blackman and Macnee's other (earlier) partners until years later when these episodes finally emerged on VHS tape. Diana Rigg can probably claim about 60% of the credit for the vast number of U.S. audience members who were glued to their TVs when ""The Avengers"" finally hit here. The other 40% (not forgetting Macnee's fine performances) had to do with the presentation of this excellent series.

Starting in 1965, with Rigg, the filmscore was notably updated and played more prominently throughout the story, enhancing the action and suspense. Also, the action itself was boosted. There was never a dull moment with Steed and Mrs. Peel. And these episodes were all FUN -- one embraced a sense that Macnee and Rigg were having a great time in making these films. Now that I've seen episodes from ""The Avengers'"" earlier years, ('63 and '64), I can see that they dragged quite a bit during that earlier era and were much more soap opera-ish. The fun continued throughout the final year, 1968, even though Linda Thorson was simply never quite as dynamic or as sexy as Diana Rigg. The '68 filmscore and title scenes at the beginning and the conclusion of each episode were spiffed up a bit too.

Each of these 52-minute episodes is futuristic (at least for the period) and on the cutting edge of excellent television productions. I know of no series, ""The Original Star Trek Series"" excepted, which has remained as timeless as ""The Avengers"". You'll encounter, in the 1968 episodes, every nemesis ranging from Eastern spies posing as murderous British Army officers to equally murderous hotel desk clerks.

In the 1968 Set No. 4 (which includes Vols. 7 and 8), we're talking about seven very enjoyable, action-packed, color episodes:

Volume 7:

""Wish You Were Here"" - In a parody of ""The Prisoner"" Tara attempts to free her uncle from a hotel which has a firm ""no check-out early"" policy. This is a superb episode.

""Stay Tuned"" - Investigating Steed's amnesia (a returning theme from previous years), Steed and Tara uncover a plot to kill their boss, ""Mother"".

""Take Me To Your Leader"" - A briefcase stuffed with money and a bomb seems to have a mind of its own - and it's giving strange orders.

Volume 8:

""Fog"" - When foreign committee members arrive in London for a meeting, they find themselves stalked by the ""Gaslight Ghoul,"" a Victorian killer with a modern motive.

""Homicide and Old Lace"" - On his birthday, Mother tells tales of an older adventure. The flashback scenes were originally filmed for the never-aired episode, ""The Great Britain Crime"".

""Love All"" - The missile department is leaking secrets but Steed and Tara sniff out the source of the indiscretion. A terrific episode.

""Get-A-Way"" - A prison is having trouble holding enemy agents. The first two escapees knock off Steed's pals... is he the next on the list?

The storylines of the various ""The Avengers"" episodes seem absurd to varying degrees as we view them today - but 1968 continued to escalate the absurdity beyond the previous years' entries. This did not diminish my enthusiasm for the ""The Avengers"" because the overall series always manifested a ""Batman"" (TV series) tongue-and-cheekness about it. I mention this only to prepare viewers for this actuality.

The casting in all episodes is spot-on, punctuated with the very best sets and scenic locations. And Linda Thorson's astounding beauty (tenoned with her great figure!) really accentuates the `60s look in her mod attire.

I'll be reviewing all of the 1968 sets, (as I mentioned earlier, there are five in all, with 2 ""volumes"" per set), so be on the watch for my comments regarding the other sets at their appropriate sites on Amazon. In the meantime, while not exactly as marvelous as the 1967 episodes, this particular set still garners my highest recommendation!"
4165,767015525,1,"I used to watch the show as teen and would catch it on A&E when it used to come on. Sure it was campy but it was fun to watch. This movie is no such luck. It was doomed from the minute the director screamed action. The whole plot involves some asinine scheme by August De Wynter(played by Sean Connery) to control the world weather. The British secret service assign Emma Peel(Uma Thurman) and John Steed(Ralph Fiennes) to the case. The story also involves plot twist where one of the head of the secret service(affectionately called ""Mother"") is in cahoots with Sir Wynter. When you're not laughing at the cheesy dialogue, you cracking up at the hackneyed fight scenes and the overacting by Sean Connery, who seems to have more fun chewing up scenery even though he advised people not to watch it. The chemistry between Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman is non-existent. The mechanical bees and the teddy bear costumes...nice. This movie wasn't pre-screened for a reason and Sean Connery did warn people not to see this movie. You can put two and two together and see the outcome. People overact like its going out of style, the humor is on par with those Roger Moore James Bond flicks and the premise is pretty juvenile. If you liked the show you'll hate the movie."
4166,767015525,1,"How can you improve on perfection?  The original series with Diana Rigg was one of the best ever.  It was campy, perfectly synchronized with the oddities of 1960s design, worldview, and style, and told good, short stories.  It was a wonderful world unto itself.

By contrast, this film tries for camp without synching with the times, for an old-fashioned chemistry that it traduces (Emma and Steed had wonderful sexual tension, but everything else was implied, never shown), and for a weird yet believable story.  But it fails utterly.

This film is so bad that it is like making a comic book version of a comic book.  Not only do Fiennis and THurman utterly lack chemistry, in spite of their great talent, but the plot is simply and stupidly unbelievable.  I think that this is the worst tv-remake I have ever seen.  That answers the question:  you shouldn't try to exploit perfection by slapping together a stupid film.

Not recommended.  THere are far better things to waste one's time on."
4167,767015525,4,"Yes, it looks like it was edited with a chainsaw (blame the studio). Yes, Ralph Fiennes looks like he'd rather be elsewhere. And yes, the teddy bear suits look ridiculous. Guess what? I still love it! This, my friends, is what I call a guilty pleasure. Does it always make sense? Hell no, especially since there seems to be a lot missing (judge for yourself by watching the theatrical trailer). But it's so much fun. Let me say right now that I have never seen the old television series, so I went into this movie a novice. And I was entertained. It's campy, over the top and a little silly. But it's okay. As much as I love this film, I hope someday to see the whole uncut Director's version just to fill in the (many) holes. There are far worse movies out there, trust me, and if you just give yourself over to it, you may be pleasantly surprised."
4168,767015525,1,"As someone who was an insatiable fan of The Avengers British TV series, I was horrified when this movie appeared in 1998.  I have always felt that one cannot improve upon perfection, and, at least as far as I was concerned, the original Avengers was about as close to that as anything can be, and still be man-made.  Because of this, I vowed NOT TO SEE IT!

All right...granted, this movie has a marvelous cast, and even boasted a cameo role for Patrick Macnee (the first -- no, make that the REAL John Steed), but this was just another case where a great cast does not necessarily a good movie make.

Well, I kept my vow for all these years, but finally broke down and recently watched The Avengers, the movie.

OUCH!

Even Sean Connery couldn't pull this one out of the dumpster!  It was painful.  I was only able to suffer through half of it before I had to eject the disk in self defense!  To cleanse myself, I watched three straight hours of the REAL Avengers immediately.

If you are tempted to watch this travesty because you fancy one of the stars...DON'T.  Go and purchase another of their films instead, or, better yet, go and find the original Avengers and have at it!  You'll be delighted, entertained, and you'll see it done the way it was INTENDED.

This was just...sad..."
4169,767015525,4,"Get-A-Way is rather silly and dated(even for 1968) and Wish You Were Here is just silly AND annoying. Other than that, I liked the rest of the episodes just fine, even the compilation Homicide and Old Lace, which had to use several season 5 scenes to pad everything out. Strange, but interesting."
4170,767001311,5,Great humor . We've lost a lot of that .
4171,767001311,4,Glad this old favorite is available on DVD!
4172,767001311,5,Big Fan
4173,767001311,5,"the dvd's are in perfect shape, I'm very pleased"
4174,767001311,5,Great show
4175,767001311,4,"The new edition of The Bob Newhart Show: Complete Series from Shout Factory, with all six seasons of the show, is an immense improvement over the four seasons released by 20th Century Fox.  The picture quality improvement is huge.  Also, these are the complete episodes not abridged episodes often found in syndication.  My only disappointment is the lack of subtitles."
4176,767001311,5,love these.  sound and picture are very good
4177,767001311,5,Love the show and to have all seasons and extras in one set is fantastic.
4178,767001311,5,"Terrific, its been years since I have seen the series in its entirety. Has some terrific ""extras"" in outtakes and commentary from cast members."
4179,767001311,5,Great humor.  Excellent cast with terrific writing.  You wish Bob and Emily were your neighbors.
4180,767015525,1,"Sean Connery is an evil scientist that wants to blackmail the major countries with his evil device that can wreak havoc in the world. The Avengers must find him and stop him. Even the great Connery couldn't save this dog from the DVD discount bins in Walmart, although his performance brings the only class to this sham.

Ralph Fiennes is an outstanding actor in many other things. In this one he just missed that brilliant sparkle that the British own, and he doesn't get it. While he was brilliant in movies such as Schindler's List, this is another one of his hit and misses. I'm not very familiar with Uma Thurman, I know a lot of people drool over her, and it's obvious why. However, she also didn't have that chic magic that the original Mrs. Peel possessed.

The plot and scenery remind me of a well-made computer animation game--today's audience accepts this sort of 'near realism' but I could do without it, I would have enjoyed more thought provoking plot lines.

I wouldn't own this one but it's worth a watch on one of the premium movie channels if you're bored. I'm only hoping that another sequel isn't made, this was enough of a waste of money and film."
4181,767015525,1,"I can count on one hand the number of movies that I've actually stopped in the middle because they were so bad I just couldn't tolerate watching the rest. And this pathetic movie is one of them.

I'm not sure what they were thinking, but the plot is slow, the british humor is lamer than normal, and what on earth was up with the giant Grateful Dead-esque Teddy Bear costumes??

The only thing worse than watching this movie is the fact I originally confused it with something else and didn't realize I'd seen part of it on Cable before and then ended up trying to watch it again to see if it realliy was that bad.. and indeed it was. I couldn't sit through more than 1/3 of it this time either..

No James Bond/007 here.. this is a big dud.."
4182,767015525,5,Classy remake and one that stands on its own two feet as well.  Thurman and Fiennes were superb choices IMHO for the roles. It bears re-watching which to me is a great compliment -- the scenes are done well enough that I enjoy seeing them again even though I know what's going to happen next.  Another plus is that Eddie Izzard is in the cast.
4183,767015525,1,"With this cast and the source to work from this should have been great , but alas the shot themselves in the foot with this bomb. Next to ""Wild,Wild, West"" as the worst T.V. show to movie ever made!!!!!!!!"
4184,767015525,1,"I like bad movies sometimes, especially ones with big budgets. But all the other reviews were right, this is a bad movie! I am not a fan of, or seen many of the original ""Avengers"", so I had no preconceived ideas that way about how the story should go. And had really wanted to ""enjoy"" a big budget, bad movie. It doesn't start out to bad, but I found the lack of chemistry between all the actors to be unbearable. It's like they are all acting in separate movies, or have some sort of off screen feud going on, and refuse to talk to each other. But in the appalling delivery of lines, apparently written by someone with a severe lack of imagination and no sence of humor.

 Also, if you had seen only this movie with Sean Connery, you would wonder just why he was an actor. The bear suit was not his finest hour...although pretty funny.

 And I also have to wonder just why when casting this, the ""supporting"" role of henchman (with no lines) was given to a stand up comedian, Eddie Izzard. Known for being a non-stop talker. But of course for the one and only cuss word for the whole movie...and I swear that it's not Eddie Izzard's voice in the first place, just a dubded in word.

 So finely, this movie does get a star because the location shots are not bad. And you have to enjoy the only opportunity to see a deeply respected actor(Connery), make a fool of himself in a gigiant bear suit. Other than that, if you really must find out how bad this is...rent it!"
4185,767015525,4,"I have never written a review but felt I absolutely had to in defense of this film - it IS truly awful but that's what makes it so hilarious. If you watch it, you must do so in the right frame of mind - be prepared for a comedy and you might just love this movie as much as I do!"
4186,767015525,2,"ok benning the some what new kid at 28 yrs old I have watch the movie in question and all of the origal tv shows. Benning in the Army I have alot of time to watch and compare things. We all know at this ponit in life that no matter what Hollywood gets thier hands on one of two things will happen. They will do it right or they will just stright ""F"" it up. So I don't know why you are sitting here wasting time to bitch about something you can't do anything about. It's done and over with people. The movie suck a** and we are stuck with it from now to the day we kick the bucket. The only thing we can do is stay true to the tv show that we have come to love and joy and never bring up the movie again unitl someone can get it right. Thats all you have to do. As far as the movie goes it was alright nothing to really talk about. Oh here something to think about.""Shows made in the UK that are a big hit should stay in the UK don't let hollywood get a hold of it and anything that hollywood puts out the Britsh will probbly make it better,thats the way I see it so far.""

Peace two figures.

4187,767015525,1,"Even though we approached this movie with the attitude that it had the same title and characters as a series that we enjoyed, but that it would most likely be different from the series, we were seriously disappointed. The movie stinks. 'Steed' is not comfortable with his umbrella or his bowler hat, and 'Mrs. Peel' is channelling 'poison ivy' from the Batman film. The plot is threadbare, the acting is woeful. Even Sean Connery fails to save this movie.

Rent it if you have to watch it, it's not worth buying. Better yet, buy one of the box sets of the original series. Even on her worst days, Diana Rigg's Mrs. Peel is far sexier and wittier than Uma Thurman's attempt, and Patrick Macnee's wit and dry humour has to be seen to be believed."
4188,767015525,2,"No one was clamoring for a big-screen remake of the classic ""Avengers"" TV series, but Hollywood didn't listen and churned out this forgettable box-office fiasco. Despite its impressive visual style, the finished product made a good cast look terribly foolish. Ironically, the film's most positive aspect was introducing new viewers to the original exploits of John Steed and Emma Peel."

4194,767001311,5,"The show is funnier now than when I watched it and the interviews with Bob and cast members are priceless, especially with those now gone. So fun to listen to Bob laugh at these shows."
4195,767001311,5,WOW!
4196,767001311,3,"If you have the 20th Century Fox double-sided DVD's from years ago, keep them and DO NOT buy this set as a replacement for seaasons 1-4. Another reviewer has suggested that the new Shout seasons 1-4 have ""video quality beyond superior to those awful two-sided discs"". They DO NOT! I have both sets (bought this set on that reviewer's comments) and compared several episodes from each season 1-4 on a side-by-side basis. They are IDENTICAL in video quality.

In fact, of great disappointment are Shout's seasons 5 and 6, which are noticeably poorer in video quality as compared to seasons 1-4. It looks as though Shout simply took the 20th Century Fox two-sided DVD's and duplicated them while slapping some old VHS recordings of seasons 5 and 6 onto their new DVD's. Shout, clearly, does not want to spend any money doing digital remastering. Additionally, this new Shout version has no subtitles in any of the seasons, unlike the original 20th Century Fox release.

Still, it's better than not having seasons 5 and 6, so I gave Shout 3 stars for releasing seasons 5 and 6, but Shout is not the high quality organization claimed to be. The seasons 5 and 6 are being released separately. Buy them instead of duplicating your seasons 1-4 with this complete series offering. Of course, if you don't have any seasons, then buy this complete series."
4197,767001311,5,video and audio clear.  looks like it did originally.  great reproduction.  I highly recommend it.
4198,767001311,5,"Excellent series. Just as I remembered the dry-witted Bob Newhart. Bill Daly is a riot, also."
4199,767015525,2,"I have to say that I am not familiar with the series, or had had any other contact with the characters apart from this movie so I cannot make any comparisons to other sources, nor can I take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have.  Therefore, coming from someone that did not ""know"" of The Avengers prior to the film I have to say... that I was rather disappointed!

Apart from the GREAT cast (Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, and Sean Connery among others) and the very good acting, the plot and the dialogues are way below average!  In addition, the whole ""weird"" atmosphere just for the sake of being ""different"" and ""original"" just falls flat!

Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...

In a nutshell, it's a weak movie; it lacks that something to make it bearable, let alone put it over the top.  No masterpiece here."
4200,767015525,1,"This movie must have been done by ""The Producers.""  Every thing possible to make it unrealistic seems to have been done.

Steed and Emma seem to be culturally lower class people who have come into inheritances which they use to buy expensive clothes.  The actress that plays Emma would be more realistically cast as a prostitute.

The characters substitute arrogance for talent.

My favorite bad scene is where Emma is walking away from Steed and unable to see him.  She has her sword over her shoulder point to her back.  Steed hits her sword on opposite sides with his sword.  This is something the Three Stooges would do.  The real Steed would have whacked Emma's bottom with his sword."
4201,767015525,5,I received my package in the condition it was advertised in as well as in a timely manner. I recommend this seller.
4202,767015525,1,"At last I got to see this film.  I wish I did not!  This is nothing short of kidnapping the characters of Mrs. Emma Peel and John Steed by a squad of Hollywood SCAVENGERS!  I could understand pairing Steed with a new female partner played by Thurman.  Thurman fails miserably (and embarrasingly) at capturing the essence of a cultural icon of the caliber of Mrs Peel.  I found myself so embarrased watching Thurman stumbling her way in her unconvincing attempt to embody the character of Mrs Peel.  Way to go Uma :-D  The other problem is:  Fiennes is NO Steed.  Gone is the wit and charm, the playful sexuality, and the magical chemistry!  Thumbs down!  Hopefully we'll have something better next time! Meanwhile, hold on to your Mrs Peel Megaset DVD set :-)  Of course, one would say that we, the hard core fans of the TV show, should lighten up.  Issue is that I expect a multimillion project in the form of a film production to open up new vistas, and to throw new light on that landscape we know very well from the TV show.  Thurman, Fiennes, and the script writer of the film were not expected to copy and imitate.  But at least to give us the viewing pleasure of what we came to expect in that experience of watching the TV show.  Instead, we got an infantile love affair, childish sexual gazes that lacked the vagueness and playful complexity of Riggs' Emma and Macnee's Steed, silly lines, and gestures that lacked vitality, and so on and so forth (by comparison, we all know the endings, for example, of 'Too Many Xmas Trees,' 'The Negative Positive Man,' and 'The house that Jack Built,' to name only a few).  What I expected is a Thurman that could have enriched the character of Emma.  What we got is an Emma melting to a kiss on one occasion, and an Emma who is so mistrustful of Steed because he dared look at her asleep!"
4203,767015525,1,"Let me just say that I love all the Avengers from Mrs. Gale to Tara King (for the most part) and I do love the actors of The Avengers movie but this movie stinks. It has nothing to do with the original show. First off Mrs. Peel never dealt with Mother. Mrs. Peel also did not have an on screen affair with Steed either. But Hollywood got it's paws on the story and ruined it. If your a fan of the show then you will hate this movie. I even tried to watch it a second time and just turned it off. This after Wal Mart had it for $5.00 on a discount rack. I should have been free.

Nothing in this movie blends with the real show. Nothing! I only wish that the real Avengers fans had a say with the script before they drove the image in the ground. I bet the script writer never really watched the show in the first place.

Stick with the original Avengers of the 60's. It can never be replicated. At least not in this movie."
4204,767015525,5,"Hi everyone,

I found this film to be delightful. It's about two agents living in London, England, who are on a mission to stop a well-to-do knight from controlling the weather. By controlling the weather with his large weather-making machine, Sir Sean Connery, incidentally a knight himself in real-life, wants to rule the world, but not if Steed and Mrs. Peel have their say in it!

It's humorous and exciting throughout the movie. Interestingly, the villain of the film played by Sir Sean Connery resides at BLenheim Palace, a breath-taking private residence owned by His Grace the Duke of Marlborough in Oxon, England, which you get to see the massive and beautiful interior in the film,  too!

I rate this film 5-stars.

*(Highly recommended for anyone above 12 due to mild profanity and some violence.)*"
4205,767015525,3,"I agree with the other reviewers here in that this film does not represent the best work of its stars, and the movie as a whole probably fell short of its aims. But there are too many good (and highly original) scenes too write it off altogether. (eg. the optical illusion looking down on Emma Peel as she tries to escape down a staircase yet ends up on the same floor).

Also, the romantic restraint of the two lead characters makes a refreshing change from the contemporary norm, which is either based on tease & innuendo, or can't-wait-to-rip-each-others-clothes-off.

As for the teddy bears scene that has been so blasted, I found it so unexpected & bizarre that I had to laugh. And surely that was the intention of the film...

Anyway, I enjoyed it. Just watch it with an open mind and, for God's sake, don't take it seriously. I especially recommend this film if you are a fan of English architecture (there are some great shots of interiors & exteriors of both modern & historical), or a sucker for Uma Thurman's stylish warmth (like me :))"
4206,767015525,1,"Being a big fan of Uma Thurman, I picked this up the other day on DVD (much to the dismay of my friends) for only $1 at a local pawn shop. I was curious see if the movie still came across as bad to me as it did when I originally saw it theatrically. Did it??? Please continue reading......

On the surface, The Avengers seemed to have all the required ingredients for a surefire summer blockbuster. You had plenty of star power in the form of Sean Connery, Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes. There was a 60 million dollar budget to spend and the movie was based on a 60's cult british secret agent series of the same name that had a dedicated and pretty sizable cult following. You also had Uma Thurman strutting around in an extremely tight leather body suit. Everything seemed initially in place to deliver an updated 90's theatrical version that could have been a cool/fun alternative to the James Bond films. But what ended up in theaters was the biggest bomb of the summer of 1998 (and of the whole year for that matter) and one of the worst films ever released by a major studio.

In its theatrical form, The Avengers was a jumbled, murky and incoherent mess that made hardly any sense no matter how hard you tried to figure out what exactly was going on. My friends and I saw it for free back in 1998 despite the fact that it had not been screened for critics (always a terrible sign) and left the theater with a very bad headache, wondering what in the hell we had just been subjected to. The worst sin that this movie commited was that besides the bizarre teddy-bear costumes (I'll get back to those later on!) this movie isn't even enjoyable on a so-bad-it's-good level.

The basic plot involves, more or less, an evil madman called Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) who has built a new weather-controlling device. The British government who has been watching his actions for quite some time. They send two of their secret agents, John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), to investigate what Sir August is up to and to thwart whatever attempts that he is making for world domination.

After the initial introductions to the two secret agents, they begin to check out Sir August's true plans and wherabouts. The movie quickly turns into a series of badly edited action scenes that fall flat every time and a series of scenes that literally make no sense at all in the grand scheme of things.

A perfect example is when John and Emma are traveling in their souped up car near the beginning (complete with a mini-coffee maker/bar), they are suddenly chased by giant remote control robotic bees. They eventually git rid of the pests, but after exiting their car it explodes for literally no reason at all. One of our first glimpses of Sir August involves a sort of meeting with some people to show off his new weather-control device. For some inexplicable reason, everyone is wearing giant multi-colored teddy-bear costumes! It truly must be seen to believed and if the rest of the movie had been as over-the-top and campy as this scene it would have been entertaining on a purely guilty pleasure level. But unfortunately, the rest of the film has the same flat and lifeless feel to it that the opening scenes exhibit.

There's also a completely unexplained subplot involving a clone of Uma Thurman running around that culminates with the real and fake Uma's batteling it out in a poorly choreographed fight in a very slow moving hot air balloon. Actually, that's this movie's biggest problem. Almost everything that happens seems unfinished and unexplained. There are some huge gaps in logic that will surely have any unsuspecting viewer screaming for someone to cut it off.

I read a while back that the original rough-cut of the movie that was test-screened with disasterous results was a little under 2 1/2 hours. Warner Bros. then demanded that the filmmakers cut the film down considerably, which they grudgingly obliged. The producers stated that the revised cut they turned in came in at 101 minutes with credits and they were actually happy with that cut. But Warner Bros. then proceeded to cut an additional 12 minutes from the film and the result was 89 minutes of terrible action scenes and no plot and logic. Do I think that the original cut would be better? It might certainly make considerably more sense, but the movie would still be awful due to some huge problems.

The acting all around is atrocious. Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever. Ralph is stoic and just looks bored. Uma goes through the movie in a variety of tight outfits (including the previously mentioned leather body suit), but her efforts at a believable british accent are laughable. She tries her best but it is very evident that she was not comfortable with her role and the script in any way. The rest of the cast just seems embarassed to be in this movie.

The film will probably gain some sort of cult status based purely on Sean Connery's over-the-top yet terrible performance. I thought that his efforts came across as way too forced and I've always wondered if he did this movie just to pay some back-taxes or a sizable poker debt. He's been in some bad movies before, but he's still managed to turn in a solid performance (Medicine Man and Entrapment for instance). But in this movie, he's just awful in every respect.

Special effects are laughable throughout with some particularly hilarious matte and model work during the film's climax involving a hot air balloon traveling at about 5 miles an hour and some awful CGI tornadoes tearing up an equally bad replica of London. The final battle between Ralph and Sean is also very reminiscent of Highlander 2 for some reason (in terms of how bad it is choreographed and edited).

I'm not sure what Warner Bros. was thinking with this one. But then again, they did the exact same thing with 1999's equally terrible Wild Wild West (which at least made back most of its budget). While I haven't seen many of the original 60's episodes that this was based, it initially seemed that this had some great potential to be a fun little secret-agent/spy movie, but the execution was botched from all angles. It is clear that everyone involved was hoping for an alternative to the James Bond franchise, but this movie immediately squashed any chance of that. The marketing campaign seemed to focus on Uma Thurman in that tight leather body suit, but even that isn't enough to recommend sitting through this migraine inducing disaster.

(On the DVD front, I'm surprised that Warner Bros. didn't include the ton of cut footage from the original version as deleted scenes. It would have really helped to shed some light on what went wrong with this movie. Much to my surprise, there is actually a cult following for this film that have been petitioning Warner Bros. for quite some time to release the original 2 1/2 version, or at the very least the second 101 minute producer's cut. It's scary to think that some people actually liked this movie!)

The Avengers is rated PG-13 and contains violence and language."
4207,767015525,5,"Each of Steed's ladies made their own mark.  Honor Blackman's Kathy Gale, set the pace.  Sleek sassy women, who were as smart as they were sexy.  They held their own in a man's world and didn't need someone to take care of them.  Blackman and Rigg were two very positive role models in a time when most women were victims, wives or secretaries on telly at the time.  Blackman made less of an impact in US, because they were generally shown as a Summer Replacement, to keep people from seeing reruns.  Since they were run on ABC, tried to be recognized as a big-boy network the old Black and White Gales were not widely scene.

Rigg came along and made Emma Peel a character that will go down in the hall of fame.  She is as popular today, if not more so.  So when she left--to do as Blackman did -- go on to be a Bond girl, Steed had to have another partner.  Enter Tara King.  She gorgeous full figure Canadian with eyes to do for.  They tried to play on her more feminine side (and with horrid fashions).  Seriously, the clothes designers for Tara needs shooting.  For the most part, they couldn't design more dumpy look clothes.  They stuffed her in a series of wigs - some very bad - so point one, she was fighting an uphill battle.  Also, the scripts were not as sharp.  Even so Tara is charming and a pleasure to watch.

Already in my wishlist.  I am SO glad they are being released.  i didn't want to shell out $$$ for the complete series since I own Seasons 1-4.

Hurry up Februrary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

So I am just keeping them. The problem was I had been taping (DVR) season 6 on We TV, and thank God I saved myself the trouble of dubbing them all. But the irony is Season Five was the best...by far...no question. They jumped the shark by season 6, even though there were some good episodes. Haven't seen what's on the bonus DVD...that could make the $100 I spent for this worth it, not to mention the $200 I spent on the other four. Pretty low budget graphics for the box. Yeah, my 2nd favorite American sitcom. But at LEAST it's out. Even if they say the DVD is dead, well I'm not far behind so who cares? Gotta have season 5. Been watching it, up to 6 episodes so far. When this show was good, nothing was better. I know in six months I can get a VG copy for $40, but hey...been waiting a LONG time for this and I don't regret the money I spent. It could have turned out worse.

4215,767001311,5,BOB NEWHART SHOW IS A CLASSIC SERIES. I had the FOX DVDS SEASONS 1-4. They were double sided. I sold those. Then this year I bought the complete series released by SHOUT FACTORY. THE SHOUT FACTORY DVDS ARE SINGLE SIDED DISCS. I already finished watching SEASONS 1-4 and have started watching season 5. For the first time I am watching the episodes on a HDTV WIDESCREEN BIG SCREEN TV. All the episodes look great and have excellent sound. The color looks nice. The new box set comes with a deluxe booklet and bonus DVD which includes the original pilot in which JERRY ROBINSON is also a psychologist. Then he became a dentist on the regular show. When I lived in California my plumber was Marcia Wallace's brother in-law. I think it is worth buying the new box set seasons 1-6 released by SHOUT FACTORY. I did not like the quality of the FOX DVDS. I think BOB NEWHART fans will love this NEW box set.
4216,767001311,5,Really nice presentation of a superb show.  Good sound and picture.

4219,767015525,1,"Let's face it...this movie is terrible, whether or not you compare it to the brilliant sixties series.  I went in with an open mind, knowing that Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg will always be John Steed and Emma Peel.  I thought the addition of Sean Connery as the villain would be a delight.  WRONG.  The tv shows' wonderful theme by Laurie Johnson is used quietly in a couple of scenes, but the main theme is another one of those preprogrammed pieces of musical nothingness.  Uma Thurman acted like she was on Prozac and Ralph Fiennes looked like he was a little boy playing like he was John Steed. And Sean, what a lousy performance..you know you could have done better.  I did like the mechanical bees sequence; the only true original touch in the movie.  The teddy bears was preposterous and almost worked, but since the whole movie was such a drag, I'm not sure anything could save it.  Macnee was smart in his invisible cameo role.  Too bad Uma didn't back out and get replaced by a more lively Mrs. Peel."
4220,767015525,5,"I just got this on sale...to all the reviews that pan this revisit; quit being Avengers snobs! You won't ever see a duo as well suited to each other as Patrick MacNee and Diana Rigg but give the current duo their propers! This a 1998 feature film version of a '60s British TV series, not a retrospective! It has the same over-the-top technology spin that the original producers would have incorporated in a heart beat, updated for the late '90s. If you paid attention to the original series it had the same eccentric characters and the same outlandish plots. That's what made the series and this film fun to watch. P.S., I could have gone for Elizabeth Hurley as Mrs. Peel."
4221,767015525,4,"This is a very watchable action flick, with Uma Thurman doing what she does best - wearing something tight and kicking the bad guys around. Sean Connery goes over the top as the mad Scottish scientist holding the world ransom. Mostly, though, it's comedy of manners. Steed and Dr. Peel (that's Thurman, but her friends can call her Mrs. Peel) maintain a relaxed tea-time manner no matter what the chaos around them or between them.

I can't compare this to the original series, which aired more than 35 year ago. I suspect that fans will find this wanting. So be it. If you can take this for itself, you'll find a decent piece of humorous action entertainment.

//wiredweird"
4222,767015525,3,"I have pretty high standards when it comes to movies...AND TV shows, and I can't, for the life of me, see what is so gawrsh-awful about this movie. Granted, the superfeminine Diana Rigg isn't playing Mrs. Peel...and yes, dapper, veddy British Patrick McNee isn't parlaying Steed, but they did pretty well with what they had, and had a plotline that you were actually able to FOLLOW, to boot! This is something I remember the TV show NOT having...most of the stories were just platforms for Emma to be stylish in, with no clues, no O. Henry, no real DISCERNIBLE plot thread to speak of...just the barest of storylines....

The story involves Steed first MEETING Emma, (again!) and Emma being a major renaissance woman...doctor, meteorologist, psychologist, etc....the woman holds more degrees than a Kelvin thermometer!! The film opens up with Steed being tested for reflexes and skills as he strolls through a mockup of a British village. Pram-pushing nannies throw knives, pub drinkers try to run him over, bobbies attack him unbidden...he comes through with flying colors. Switch to Emma Peel's fabulous flat in London...she gets the call from the elite arm of the BSS that Steed works for after it's discovered that she, or a double of her, has sabotaged her own project.

What follows are chase scenes from hell; some VERY mannered acting; Sean Connery chewing the scenery as a megalomaniac meteorologist and businessman who wants to, what else, RULE THE WORLD...by controlling the weather. Steed and Emma go after him when it's discovered, unequivocally, that it IS a double of Emma sabotaging her project...and in fact, attempting to kill the original Mrs. Peel!

The cinematography and art direction for this film is EXCELLENT. The music, however, except for the lifts from the series, seems somewhat inappropriate and overly ponderous. There are some hair-raising chase scenes in the film, one with a fleet of mechanical, anti-personnel hornets, and Connery's acting is perfect for his role. The style of the series is recaptured nicely, especially with the villians' confab scene in teddy bear mufti in the middle of the film, and Emma wandering through what looks like M.C. Escher's summer home.

All in all, the phlegmatic bearing of Fiennes and Thurman in the face of it all remind you an AWFUL lot of the original Steed and Emma, and the climax between Steed, Emma, Connery, Eddie Izzard, Fiona Shaw, as the very teutonic-looking ""Father"", (supposedly one of the GOOD guys,) and Connery's henchmen is fairly entertaining.

While it may never win a spot on AFI's top 100, it IS diverting. My one complaint is...why did they have to pick UMA THURMAN...Ms. Box Office Poison herself, to play Emma? Was Nicole Kidman busy? Emma Thompson? Miranda Richardson? WHY A YANK??!! And ESPECIALLY her?? Didn't ""Batman & Robin"" tell them ANYTHING??!!"
4223,767015525,1,"To understand why The Avengers movie so totally misses the mark, you have to understand why the original Patrick Macnee/Diana Rigg British TV series worked so well. This requires a bit of historical perspective. Britain in the early/mid-1960s was a culture in which long-accepted norms were threatened by powerful social forces. The youth movement was forever redefining attitudes toward authority and government, Britain was birthing a type of music that would soon sweep the world, and, particularly important to The Avengers, the women's rights movement saw many a woman demand more from her future than a lifetime of housewifedom.

When Diana Rigg's character of Emma Peel was first introduced to The Avengers in 1965, the show had already been going for several years. The character of John Steed was well-established as a conservative, stiff upper lipped, tea drinking, bowler hatted, ex-military, prime example of upper crust middle-aged traditional British masculinity. Then along came his new partner Emma Peel: young, irreverent and outspoken, sexually aggressive, dressed in provocative mod fashion AND possessed of four doctorates. Bear in mind, at this time in Britain it was almost unheard of for a woman to be a doctor at all. Not only did Emma Peel defy that convention, she did it times four.

To John Steed, exemplar of the-way-things-are-and-should-be, Emma Peel was the living embodiment of forces threatening to destroy everything he held dear, everything to which he'd devoted his life, his duty, his sacred honor. To Peel, Steed was the sort of hidebound reactionary she'd been fighting against her entire life in order to be the sort of woman, the sort of whole person her sense of individuality demanded. The great thing about the John Steed/Emma Peel Avengers episodes was watching these two very different people, each representing social forces the other had every reason to despise, over time learn to value and respect what the other had to offer, eventually even to love each other. An endless source of debate among Avengers TV fans is whether or not Steed and Peel's relationship ever became sexual or was simply platonic. Whichever opinion you embrace, there can be no doubt the love and respect were there.

The Avengers TV show was profoundly fortunate in its casting of John Steed and Emma Peel. Patrick Macnee perfectly portrayed the somewhat stuffy, exceedingly proper man of action. The heart of a noble knight in a three-piece suit and bowler hat. But as good as Macnee was, Diana Rigg's casting as Emma Peel was the masterstroke. For Emma Peel to accomplish everything she had in life before ever meeting John Steed, she must have been a high-level genius. Fortunately for the show, in real life Diana Rigg has an IQ that looks like a zip code, as well as immense class, polish, sex appeal, a strong will, and the thespic skills of a successful Shakespearean actress. When Diana Rigg played a high-level genius with multiple doctorates it was believable. I can't imagine anyone else who could have portrayed Emma Peel so well.

So that's why the original Steed/Peel episodes of The Avengers rocked. And that's why the movie is a failure, because it has none of that going for it. It could be argued the social milieu within which the TV series existed, that provoked and informed its subtext, no longer exists and so the movie couldn't have used it anyway. Maybe. But I see no evidence the moviemakers were even aware of it. The props are there, the surface accoutrements, Steed's umbrella and bowler hat, Peel's catsuit, but the conflicts and dynamic that drove the original relationship and made it something truly special are nowhere to be found.

The casting in a problem. Ralph Fiennes tries hard but is hideously miscast. He's too young, too contemporary looking, to portray a rock-ribbed conservative like John Steed. Uma Thurman, though I respect her as an actress, was similarly a poor choice to play Emma Peel. From watching Uma Thurman in interviews I get a sense of her as an intelligent, thoughtful human being, but she simply can't convincingly portray a high-level genius like Emma Peel. Thurman's Peel is more coquettish than intellectual. When Diana Rigg says she has four doctorates you buy it. When Uma Thurman says the same thing, you can't.

There are other reasons to dislike this movie, but none as important as those just discussed. A great television show does not necessarily translate to a great movie when those making the latter fail to understand what made the former great, and the two leading roles are horribly miscast. If you want to enjoy The Avengers, check out the Patrick Macnee/Diana Rigg originals, and give this turkey a pass."
4224,767015525,1,So bad.  Watch the 60's TV episodes as they have come out on VHS and DVD but don't touch this with a 10ft pole.
4225,767015525,5,"Totally misunderstood movie. A unique and visually stunning film with fantastic costume and set design. Ralph Fiennes was superb as British secret John Steed and gave the character some much needed sex appeal which in my opinion was sadly lacking in the original series. Eileen Atkins produced a classic 60s Avengers style character with her portrayal of 'Alice'. Sadly the Avengers does appear to have been very badly hacked in the editing room at the 11th hour and would certainly benifit from a release of the full length version. 'The Avengers' stayed true to the spirit of the original TV series and visually even improved upon it - Uma Thurman looked almost edible as Mrs. Peel. A fun and highly entertaining movie if you don't take it too seriously. I for one don't know what all the critical fuss is about.
(...)"
4226,767015525,4,"WARNING:  Even though the packaging says it includes 6 trailers, There is only one.  Appearantly the other five trailers are included on a CD which is no longer part of the latest DVD release.
I loved this movie.  The photography is crisp and beautiful.  And there are some Uma Kill Bill action.  If you are an Uma Kill Bill fan, you'll enjoy this movie much more than what the critics are saying."
4227,767015525,4,"It would seem that many of the people who reviewed this movie are unfamiliar with the original tv series and, as such, don't 'get it'. The combination of understated British humour and the surreal were staples of the tv series and this is reflected in the film, which is why we have criminals dressed as teddy bears and an old lady despatching the baddies with a machine gun. If you're expecting a typical Hollywood formulaic action film (as it would seem Warner Bros were!), then you will probably be disappointed. However, fans of the quirky and offbeat will find much to entertain them in this film. You may call me odd but I enjoyed it thoroughly! It's just a shame that the original longer version was butchered because the test audiences didn't get it. A Directors Cut DVD with commentaries etc would be most welcome."
4228,767015525,3,"I never saw the orginal Avengers series, but judging by the reviews, I think I ought to.  I love Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes which is why I bought the movie, and they did a heck of job styling up their characters in post-60s mod.  But The plot was completely crap and disjointed.  Someone on the editting floor was not paying attention to what they were doing.

Nonetheless, entertaining enough to pass a boring day."
4229,767023447,5,"As glimpsed by director-interviewer Matthew Diamond, Paul Taylor is at once a brutal task-master, insecure about his work, and overall, a somewhat remote human being, owing to a solitary early life in foster care. But a pure love of the dance is the unifying, invigorating force for him and his company, and we are the beneficiaries in this candid, behind-the-scenes look at a bona fide artistic institution."
4230,767023447,5,"Having danced at the Paul Taylor School in the late 1980's, I can say that this film is an accurate portayal of what being a modern dancer in NYC at the time was like. The dance segments are nicely filmed and edited with views from the wings for a dancer's perspective.  I particularly enjoyed the interviews with past Taylor dancers and their recollections of working under Paul, who had mood swings and despite his elevated status in the dance world, is, after all, human."
4231,767023447,5,"This is a documentary DVD that shows every aspect of the creative forces involved in producing what I believe to be the most captivating of art forms.  ""Dancemaker"" is long on intimacy, giving equal time to the minds, the hearts, the souls and the bodies which collaborate to produce great modern dance.  The genius of Paul Taylor and Director Matthew Diamond combine to make an extraordinary documentary.
The first thing which struck me was the spontaneity with which Mr. Taylor was shown creating one of his new works.  Standing side-by-side with one of his dancers, the two just ... moved ... and then conjectured about what might go next:  ""you could start this way ... and then, maybe ...""  Very interesting.  While there is a generous offering of studio footage, the recurring stereotype of the intensely driven dancemaster imploring his subjects to understand the gravity of his holy creation (you've seen this in movies) does not exist in this film.  No cinematic exaggeration here:  it's just the truest depiction of what happens as dance is created.  In reality, the emotion and interaction between Mr. Taylor and his dancers is often more characteristic of a family than of a teacher/student relationship.
Aside from following people around, Mr. Diamond's camera gets to many places I've never seen before.  I loved the views from the wings in the opening sequence (""Esplanade""), and also during the performance in India when the sound system went dead and the crew was trying not to be frantic during the silence (the dancers continued on without missing a step until the sound was restored!).  I also got a kick out of the dancer in his hotel room explaining what he had to go through to wake up after a night of performing.
The film highlights two dance pieces, ""Aureole"" and ""Piazzolla Caldera,"" and even though they aren't seen in their entirety, there is no diminishment in their strength and beauty.  Mr. Diamond, who has also directed episodes of PBS's ""Great Performances,"" was adept at interspersing the contrasting performance film (color) with studio footage (black and white) so that the two meshed perfectly.  The editing during the dance numbers was the best I've ever seen, incorporating both the more typical audience vantage point with the more dramatic on-stage perspective from amongst the dancers.  The proximity and the viewing angles were stunning; a wonderful surprise.  There's also a fair amount of footage from the Paul Taylor Dance Archives, showing a younger Mr. Taylor and company performing signature works.
In maintaining the foundation of a storyline, the film incorporates a biographical aspect, showing the evolution of Mr. Taylor's role as a dancemaker as an outgrowth of his boyhood years.  The interviews with his long-time friends and associates, as well as the words of Mr. Taylor himself, are proof of the depth and seriousness with which he reveres his art.  The film also touches on the troubling business realities that weigh on dance companies:  having to remain financially solvent, and dealing with the picket lines which materialized in New York after the company hired non-union musicians.  There's even a scene involving the firing of one of his dancers (""I just didn't want to work with her""), a somber sequence of dialogues, but one which lends strength to the reality of this film.
As far as DVD features go, nothing extraordinary, but lots to read about the ""inspirations and interpretations"" behind the dances, biographies of selected dancers, and a scrolling list of the company's complete repertory (through 1999).
Overall, this film's portrayal of the ways in which modern dance is created and portrayed make this a DVD I'd recommend to anyone.  Every minute was fascinating."
4232,767023447,5,"This film is more than a portrait of a choreographer. It is a portrait of his company. And of the small, not-for-profit arts institution in America. From beginning to end the viewer gets a glimpse of what it takes for such an institution to survive and remain creative in an environment that doesn't always appreciate innovation and creativity. Director Matthew Diamond (himself a former dancer and choreographer) has done an excellent job of interweaving rehearsal and live performances with archival footage and talking heads (dance critics, administrative staff, technical crew, dancers, former dancers, and Taylor himself all get their say). Taylor comes across, in turns, as impish (fabricating stories to please the press), vague (struggling to communicate new steps to his dancers), nervous (constantly chewing gum), fearful (""my inspiration comes from fear""), and autocratic (in the course of the film he fires one of his dancers). But most of all, Taylor comes across as insecure and vulnerable. One especially telling moment in the film comes when the company is performing in India and the sound system fails. The dancers continue dancing in silence while the crew busies itself trying to fix the problem. The music comes back on and the company is in perfect sync. Taylor revealingly says, ""My dance was ruined. And they were the heroes, not me. They stole the show."" As one former company member put it when describing Taylor's origins: ""There was [Martha] Graham and then there was this big dysfunctional family, and Paul Taylor was one of them....And they all brought their own dysfunction to their own companies.""
The director should be applauded for the way he avoided dance cliches and dull, straight-on filming of dance performances. Especially exciting was the from-the-wings view of the energetic ""Esplanade"" that opens the film. And the most entrancing sequence is the male solo from ""Aureole."" For this, Diamond has intercut a current rehearsal of Patrick Corbin learning the dance with three different archival versions of Taylor performing the same work. The music continues seamlessly as the visuals switch from one point in time to another, suggesting without preaching, that dances have a life of their own...and a good one has a chance of outlasting any of its interpreters. Diamond's other dance films include ""Speaking in Tongues"" (also Paul Taylor's company) and ""A Balanchine Celebration,"" fine and important films in their own right, though not equal to this masterpiece."
4233,767023447,5,"Paul Taylor provides us with movement's ideas which remain in our memory, ideas which  impress us with their genius simplicity. Paul works like a sculptor of flowing movements each movement is in the context. His choreography is lyrical, abstract and very musical. Paul takes his ideas from the real world with real people. It is very clear for me that Paul and his dancers work  with deep attitude towards art, with  deep love and absolute dedication. This fact makes the relationship between Paul and his dancers and the audience very strong  and intimate. The viewer can get the impression that art is in the center and not  people who serve it. Paul who had dance in Anna Sokolow's Le Grand Spectacle at American Ballet  Theater  on 1957 is a successor of her work in his own way the same lyricism and visual ideas which remains in our memory."
4234,767023447,5,"Let's just put aside the fact that this is a brilliant look inside the world of Paul Taylor and Dance. And the fact that I now have a new found respect and reverence for what Paul Taylor has created over his lifetime.  And the fact that as a novice to Dance myself, as Richard Thomas promised,  I will never look at Dance the same again. These to me are  givens.
Instead, let me say that Mathew Diamond has created a piece of  film - a story - that is virtually perfect in every aspect. I challenge you  to find a creative flaw in it. And though Paul Taylor is the subject and  inspiration of this piece, Diamond is the star. ""Dancemaker"" is a  thing of beauty all by itself."

4236,767023447,5,If you're relatively new to the world of dance (as I am) this film will make you jump for joy.  It combines a loving overview of the amazing Paul Taylor's work with the intricacies of how a piece is created...you'll never  look at dance them same way again!  This film also pays tribute to the huge  collaborative effort involved in creating and performing a piece and  keeping one of the most talent-filled dance companies in the world up and  running.  The scene showing the group on tour when the music accidently  stops and the dance continues uninterrupted is sheer poetry!  This is worth  watching over and over again.  A gem of a film!
4237,767001311,5,"I am so happy the last two season were released.  I hadn't seen some episodes in thirty years.  Funny, funny, funny."
4238,767001311,5,enjoyed
4239,767001311,2,Disappointed that it does not have SUBTITLES as the Fox ones do.
4240,767001311,4,sound is fair on certain episodes. Content is great.
4241,767001311,5,My husband wanted the complete series for his birthday. He loves Bob Newhart. He loves this set!!
4242,767001311,5,Priceless laid-back hilarity from one of the masters of 20th Century comedy. And every episode is included.
4243,767001311,5,If Amazon had a higher star I give it 10 stars. Get IT
4244,767001311,4,"A great all time series.  When you got to the last year it was apparent why it went off the air.  They should have had new writers that could have kept
things going for a few more years.  On one episode it was announced that Carol and Emily were pregnant.  After that it was never mentioned again.
Somebody dropped the ball."
4245,767001311,5,I love Bob Newhart.  I have waited a LONG LONG time for seasons 5-6.  I watched him in prime time in the 70's. I wish they would have released it so you could just get seasons 5-6 and not the whole thing but that is ok with me . I am just glad 5-6 are now available. yay!
4246,767001311,5,Item exactly as described.
4247,767015525,3,"This film is absolutely amazing.  Watch it and simply stare in awe at how terrible it really is.  Hollywood still hasn't got the hint that you do not make movies out of old tv shows.  Interestingly enough, The Avengers is a more enteraining film than Hollywood sludge like Charlie's Angels, which is 100% Grade-A Crrrrrrrap.  Why?  Because it is so bad that it actually becomes amusing, unlike Charlie's Angels or Starsky & Hutch which are just plain bad with no amusement at all.  My fascination with the Avengers is just wondering A.) What was the director thinking?  B). What were the stars thinking when they signed on for this film?  The director must be a terrific salesman, coz I don't think Sean Connery is a moron.  C).  Who gave the stamp of approval that allowed this film to be released into our neighborhood theaters?  I mean, this film had to be viewed and approved by the producers.  It was probably shown to a test audience.  How did it slip through all these cracks and make it's way out?  I think of these things as I watch this film.  You wanna see Sean Connery and his band of criminals dressed as giant teddy bears?  You wanna see America's rather shallow view of the English?(tea dispenser in car, lame attempts at British dry humor)  You want to see ZERO chemistry between the leading man and woman?  You wanna see an invisible man?  You wanna see Ralph Fiennes, normally a very good actor, trying to be cool, but actually looking and acting like a total schmuck(this goes for Uma as well)? Wanna see some of the most unexciting action sequences ever filmed?  You wanna see a 90 minute film that feels like twice the length?  Basically, do you want a 90 minute instructional video to all film students about what not to do, and at the same time chuckle a few times?  Then you can't go wrong with The Avengers."
4248,767015525,4,"This movie was actually my first exposure to the Avengers, and although it has received mixed reviews, I am perhaps one of the few that enjoy this film.
I do not try to compare the movie with the television series, which is why I think so many people dislike the film.
If anything this is something that is unique and stands on its own much in the same way 'The New Avengers' cannot be compared with the original series.
I will admit that I think the film could've been a little better in parts, I have a feeling that there are many deleted scenes from this film, and this is something that is simply begging for a Director's Cut Special Edition.
Anyway, I think Ralph Fiennes does an exceptional job in the role of John Steed in that he combines the darker parts of who Steed was when the show started with Ian Hendry, with the charm, wit and sophistication on display during the Diana Rigg era.  Plus, he looks absolutely smashing with that suit and bowler hat.
Uma Thurman is no Diana Rigg, but does make the role of Emma Peel her own in this film with beauty and grace.  And I thought the chemistry between her and Fiennes was excellent.
I think Sean Connery relished playing an over-the-top diabolical mastermind in this film, and you can see that he was just having a ball.
The special effects are awesome, and I think this film could very well be a cult classic, just as long as it isn't compared with the orignal series.  The film obviously won't be for everyone, whether or not you're a fan of the show really doesn't factor into whether you'll like it or not.
I just like it for what it is, entertainment."
4249,767015525,1,"This movie is easily on my top-5 list of the worst films I have ever seen.  The painful truth of the matter is that I saw this in the theater.  What a horrible memory that is!  I am a 33-year-old male, and in my entire life I have never wanted to leave the movie-house as badly as I wanted to while watching this pile of rubbish.  I have never walked out on any movie, much to my dismay.  I should have left during this one.  In fact, I remember at least 4 people leaving the theater, never to return.  One scene, in particular, haunts me to this very day.  There is a complex conspiracy afoot, and the villains all meet one last time before the crime will unfold.  They decide to wear disguises to conceal their identities.  They are all dressed in giant, multi-colored Teddy Bear costumes!!!  What?  Yes, you read it correctly.  It is so incredibly stupid that I have a hard time retelling it without my lower intestine reaching up and strangling my brain.  (Note: that last obscure referrence is from ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"")  Anyway, this film does not deserve a long review, so I will now sign-off.  Rent or buy anything else, anything other than this movie.  I hope my warning here will save lives......or at least save people from emotional scarring.  Take care."
4250,767015525,1,"Me director.  Make movie.  Movie have people, cars, costumes, and costumes.  And costumes.  Here plot--plot very good!  It have bad guy...and good guy!  Geniyus stuff plot.  And talking stuff wrote good too, real movie sounded stuff.  Listen, and you no throw up like some watchers...
Sean Connery in plot.  In costume.  He talk.  You no throw up when he talk.  In costume.  When Ralph and Uma talk, sorry, you throw up.  On costumes.  And somebody die!  So watch and see who die.  In costume.  Me director--say, watch!  Me make good film, you like and not throw up much.  But when Ralph and Uma talk, have wastebasket ready, sorry."
4251,767015525,1,"I loved the original Avengers series. It was a near flawless program; at least until Diana Rigg left.  This film bore little resemblance to that wonderful show. The original Avengers never shied away from the occasional flagrant pun or creating wonderful, almost comic book quality characters.  However, in this film, the plot meanders. Ralph Fiennes has no comic ability, and the lovely and talented Uma Thurman pretty much sleepwalks through movie. These is no trace of the quirky style that made the Avengers so special. To those of us who have seen the TV series, it comes as little surprise that several of the original program's directors went on to success in the big screen . I doubt that anyone associated with this film will find that it leads to more career opportunities. The chemistry between Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee was always a delight to watch. Sadly in the film, Fienes looks uncomfortable, and Thurman looks bored.
This is a poorly conceived, uninspired waste of film. The television Avengers' unique character is nowhere to be found in this disaster."
4252,767015525,1,"I got caught up in the nostalgia and hype when this movie was first released. I'm one of the few people who actually saw it in the theaters. The line that best describes this movie came from another reviewer (can't remember who):
""Not only does The Avengers make you think that the filmmakers never MADE a movie before, it makes you think they've never even SEEN a movie before.""
That about sums it up. The film has a temporal problem - it's a 90's movie that's a remake of a 60's tv show and it's not entirely sure what decade it's in. It looks kind of 60s-ish then it looks kind of like it's taking place in modern times. The generic 60's English thugs with the mod haircuts look like they've been on ice for a few decades.
Sean Connery is pretty much wasted in the title role. He's blustery and over the top, but it's mostly a great sound and fury signifying nothing. Connery's not nearly as wasted as Ralph Finnes (excellent in Strange Days). Uma Thurman shows that she can't hold a candle to Diana Rigg. She ends up in the leather catsuit but doesn't have much to do once she's in it.
There are some odd bits in the middle where the movie gives a nod to some of the more mind-twisting elements of the series, but with no real effect. The cgi killer-robot bees are at best laughable and at worst downright embarrasing.
The final mano-a-mano battle royal at then end is  pretty forgettable."
4253,767015525,4,"Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, and Sean Connery star in this film based on the 1960s television series.  Sean Connery stars as Sir August de Wynter, an evil scientist who plans to threaten the world with his hi-tech weather machine which produces such phenomena as tornadoes, hail storms, extreme temperatures, and mechanical insects for good measure.  He makes his intentions known to world leaders and tells them that they must ""purchase"" their weather from him at a very hefty price.
Enter our two heroes, John Steed, played by Ralph Fiennes, and Mrs. Peel, played by Uma Thurman.  Steed is a Bond-like special agent working for a British counter-intelligence agency.  He and his partner Mrs. Peel have been assigned to destroy De Wynter.  Uma Thurman is excellent in her role.  From her high speed driving skills to her cat-like climbing reflexes, she's the perfect counterpart to Steed's intellect and no-nonsense approach.
The special effects were the high point of the film, especially the spectacular weather effects.  The tornadoes and hail storms looked very realistic, and the final battle between Steed and De Wynter is astounding.  I enjoyed this movie for several reasons.  The special effects were the main one, but the rapport between Steed and Mrs. Peel was excellent.  The two clicked throughout the film, and Steed's continuous snide but light-hearted comments made the move that much more enjoyable.  Watch this fun film and experience some cool effects while getting a laugh along the way."
4254,767015525,3,"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay back in 1966, I was in the 6th grade and discovered Steed and Emma on TV, and I adored them. So when this film was released, I never expected it to ""live up to"" the originals. But I was surprised at how faithful it was to the tone and wackiness of the old series. I may be in the minority in thinking this, but I believe ""The Avengers"" was brought lovingly to the screen. And although it ain't the ""real thing,"" it deserves kudos for being a noble, and even entertaining, effort."
4255,767015525,4,"Chemistry is Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman (who was pregnant during the making of this). It's quite deliberate on the part of the director, but it's still enough to light up the screen.
Biology is... well, Uma Thurman in skin-tight black leather. Yowza. I wanna look like that.
Home Ec... or maybe Home Dec. This movie is all about style. This makes the suspension of disbelief necessary to get through this movie go down with a honey coating.
Not much in the way of extras on this DVD, though. I'd have liked to see more."
4256,767015525,3,"The chemistry between FIENNES and THURMAN is non existant;the special effects are programmed to keep you from sleeping;CONNERY looks bored and should retire to cultivate tulips. The funny thing about this movie is that in FRENCH the dialogue seems better. If you are over forty like me,chances are you enjoyed the BRITISH series with DIANA RIGG and her lovely boots. The sixties have never been so popular since AUSTIN POWERS,but there is a limit to the filmgoer's tolrance. This film works best on television as a time-killer."

4258,767015525,1,"What a mess.  I was so disappointed by this film (especially since I invited a group of friends out to see it).  There's got to be a story behind how this movie self-destructed.
And it's too bad, because, when it came out, THE AVENGERS could've out-sluethed both Austin Powers and James Bond.  It could have had the bizarre Avengers flair with the 007 intrigue and thrills.
Personally, I thought Uma Thurman was a mistake as Mrs. Peel, only because the built-in audience (those familiar with the popular British TV show) would've expected an English girl.
Ralph Fiennes is a great choice and Sean Connery should have been the ultimate villian.
But the movie is incomprehensible.
I'd read that the director was relatively new, having directed only a couple of small, independent films.  Was he overwhelmed by the massive production or did the studio take it away from him to cut it to pieces?  What makes me wonder if it was the former is that Sean Connery's first scenes have him talking with weird, exaggerated tics and such--and then they're gone.  Connery just walks through the rest of the film.  I've always heard that Connery did not suffer fools on a movie set: did he turn on his young director?
I've read the script (which is available online) and I'm still wondering just what in the world happened to this film.
""Mrs. Peel, we STILL need you!"""
4259,767015525,5,"""I thought you lived on the edge Mrs. Peel. Is this as fast as you can go?""

I much preferred this movie to most of the James Bond movies. For one, the wit is wicked, Uma Thurman (Mrs. Peel) was born to wear a catsuit and Ralph Fiennes is a most dapper John Steed. This movie has style, yet the backdrop is a special effects surreal dream. If you love storms moving in on a beach, rainy days or just gothic style weather, this is for you.

While drinking tea most often, these two secret agents fight crime in style while resisting the impulse to drown in more than a hands-off sexual chemistry. I could watch these two play mind games for hours. In one scene John Steed is discussing Dr. Emma Peel's profile and states:

""After all, according to your file you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia, based on traumatic oppression leading to outbursts of antisocial and violent behavior.""

Then, he states that she is just his style. Of course, she is not the type of woman he needs to save from herself or anyone else for that fact and more than likely he is describing the other Mrs. Peel who seems much more violent. This Mrs. Peel can take care of herself, thank you very much.

So, what is the diabolic plan they must thwart?  Ah, yes....the evil aristocrat, Sir August DeWynter. He plans to threaten the world with his fantastic high-tech weather machine. He is capable of threatening mankind with raging ice storms, scorching temperatures and mechanical insects. The special effects in regards to the weather are seamless and spectacular.

The script is delicious, the chemistry drips over the edge of the mind into a pool of absolute surging tension and visually, The Avengers is very compelling. You will love the fencing scenes, intelligent script, British humor and tongue in cheek capers.

~The Rebecca Review"
4260,767015525,4,"I have seen this movie more than once and I am trying to understand the hostility it has generated. I am old enough to have seen the original TV series the first time around and while I remember it fondly, it was definitely a product of its time. What makes this film so enjoyable for me is that it is not merely trying to copy the old series but to reinvent it. Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are John Steed and Emma Peel this time around. No they aren't Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg nor should they try to be. They have created their own version of the characters and they work quite well together. Their overwritten dialogue is overplayed with just the proper restraint. Sean Connery as Sir August, the principal villian, seems to be underplaying his role until you notice his eyes. Watch the eyes of all the characters. They are an important motif throughout the movie. Jim Broadbent's liquid eyes as ""Mother"" are full of knowledge and sympathy while Fiona Shaw's traitorous ""Father"" is literally blind to everything. Patrick Macnee (the original John Steed) has an important cameo as an invisible man. He holds the key to the mystery but he cannot be seen.

Director Jeremiah Chechik (BENNY AND JOON) has created a modern day fairy tale out of the old series while retaining the droll humor and the surreal touches (the brightly colored teddy bears are a good example). Much of the look of the film resembles the illustrations of modern day children's books especially THE POLAR EXPRESS. My only real complaint with the film is Eddie Izzard's use of the f-word. It is totally out of character with the rest of the film and was added solely to get a PG-13 rating. I was hoping the DVD would include the missing footage cut from the film before its release but no cigar. Sources close to the film say that it would clarify a number of points including the two Mrs Peels. Perhaps we will see it in a future reissue. So for the meantime put away your preconceived baggage and try and take the film on its own terms and you may be pleasantly surprised as I was. After all seeing is believing. Tea anyone?"
4261,767015525,1,"I really, really, really hope that Patrick Macnee, Diana Rigg, Honor Blackman and Linda Thorson didn't see this abortive attempt to recreate the cult British series from the 1960's. Even with the considerable talents of Sean Connery, Uma Thurman and Ralph Finnes, this film is just about unwatchable. Poorly edited, poorly scripted and badly directed, films like this are what make movie goers shudder whenever a studio announces they are bringing a beloved TV series to the big screen. For every adaptation like The Fugitive, there are dozens of bombs like My Favorite Martian, The Mod Squad and this dud.
I am actually one of the few unlucky people to actually see this ""film"" in the theater. I fell asleep. So just to be fair and to have a complete impression of the film, I rented the DVD. I fell asleep twice more before I saw the entire film. It was so bad it made me wish I had fallen asleep a third time.
What makes my dislike of this film so disappointing is that I so wanted to enjoy it. Sean Connery is one of my favorite actors and I was looking forward to seeing him as a villan. Uma Thurman is one of the sexiest women in movies today and I wanted to see her take on Diana Rigg's Mrs. Peel. And Ralph Finnes has been in several of my favorite films, including Schindler's List and Quiz Show. However, they all fall flat in this film (although Thurman looks great in her Mrs. Peel leather outfit).
The film tries to recapture the odd flavor of the series (the Connery board meeting in which all the participants are dressed as teddy bears, for example), but falls flat every time. Finnes is miscast as John Steed (too young) and he and Thurman have none of the chemistry that Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee had in the original series.
Do yourself a favor. Instead of buying this waste of precious natural resources, buy the DVD set of the Emma Peel episodes of the original series. Then rent the DVD of this film -- you'll quickly see that newer, in this case, is definitely not better."
4262,767015525,1,One of the worst movies ever made. Watching Sean Connery in a bear suit while running around was ugly. The pair (Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman) have no chemistry what so ever and talk like their English. Horrible. He fights people with an umbrella and she can't fight at all. Mechanical bees chase their car and it was so exciting! Not! I hated this movie and Sean Connery lost any respect that I had for him. Don't ever drink tea again and eat your muffins somewhere else!
4263,767015525,2,"i give this film two stars because although you have to question why three good actors such as these would even consider this script, they still acted well with the poor amount they got. but still, how could great actors such as these three accept such a terrible script? what were they thinking?"
4264,767015525,4,"Unfortunately, the wonderful episode ""Escape Through Time"" is paired with the clunker ""The See-Through Man,"" but, well, you can't have everything.  They're nicely paired in one regard, which is that they're both faux sci-fi pieces about bad guys playing on the credibility of others with elaborate frauds.  ""See-Through Man"" is too see-through plot to maintain the suspension of disbelief, where ""Escape Through Time"" is far more cleverly done.  ""See-Through"" is largely an intentional comedy, which makes matters worse, since it's painfully unfunny  -  it's idea of humor is a comic-opera Russian idiot, who, ironically enough, is the same Russian idiot used in one of the previous season's equally spectacularly unfunny scripts.  What it does have is Diana Rigg charming her way nicely through the mess that is ""See-Through Man's"" script.
""Escape Through Time"" is by far the better piece, with Steed and Mrs. Peel trying to find out why several of England's most notorious criminals are being found dead of wounds inflicted by archaic weapons.  Seems someone is selling them the perfect escape  -  an escape into the past.  True time travel?  Or an elaborate get-rich-quick scam?  Emma goes through the elaborate plush-toy entry ritual, to find out."
4265,767015525,4,"Okay, this is not the best movie in the world. The same can be said for the TV show because it is a cult classic. Now I do admit that I am to young to understand the better parts of the show, I'm 24. Yet in terms to the movie it was not to bad. The acting could have been better, yet the costums were cool and had that over the top feel that the orginal show had.
Although the toung and cheek humor was a bit lame in the movie and could have been developed a bit more. Uma Thurman did do an okay job playing Mrs. Peel, yet more could have been said about her and personality because she does differ from the TV show. It would have been better of the movie to keep her with the same persona as the orginal Mrs. Peel then add to it to make it more 90's. The same for Ralph Fiennes. He does seem to lose his temper more in the move in contrast to the show. There are plot holes but what movie doesn't have at least one. Most people are right in that some things needed to be explaned better. The editing is really bad in the move.
The Art Department did an amazing job for the look and feel of the move. The same with the FX too simple great. Also with the Visual Effects were stunning. The cinematograph is another thing that saves this film from being a total bomb.
This move seems to wanna reach the post 60's crowd and apeal more to the teens of the 90's. with that in mind this really is not a really bad movie. For the die hard 60's kids this will be painful, but the new generation this is a pretty good flick. Yet for those who don't know about the orginal TV show by the DVD's and watch the true Emma Peel act like no once else can."
4266,767001311,1,"I already own seasons 1 thru 4, so I'm very disappointed not to be able to purchase 5 and 6 separately. The price of the complete set is a bit high when I only need two seasons. Not sure what to do, but I'm hoping the price will go down, or they will also release 5 and 6 at a later date. I do like the Bob Newhart Show, it was always a favorite."
4267,767001311,5,"After recently seeing a Bob Newhart performance at the Wilbur Theater in Boston, in which Bob received two separate standing ovations, I decided to finally buy the complete series box set of ""The Bob Newhart Show.""  Therefore, I have no problems with the earlier releases of the first four seasons of the show.  In addition, although the video quality isn't of high-definition quality, the episodes are eminently watchable.  All problematic issues were soon forgotten after I started watching the show.  Bob Newhart was one of the first successful stand-up comedians to star in a TV sitcom.  That started a trend that continued with Tim Allen, Ray Romano, Jerry Seinfeld, and many others.  In addition, the show was not cancelled by CBS because of poor ratings.  After six successful seasons, Bob decided that is was time to end the series.  The writing on the show perfectly suited Bob's personality and comedic style.  The casting choices were uniformly excellent, especially with Suzanne Pleshette as Bob's wife Emily.  Special mention must be made of Jack Riley as Bob's patient Elliot Carlin, who appeared in 56 of the 142 episodes.  To say that he is an unforgettable character is an understatement.  The box set also includes an informative booklet, which gives a brief synopsis of each episode, along with its original airdate.

What really makes this box set special are the bonus features.  Audio commentary is provided on several episodes.  The bonus disc includes the original, unaired pilot.  In it, Peter Bonerz plays Dr. Jerry Robinson as another psychologist, instead of an orthodontist.  Marcia Wallace does not appear as secretary Carol Kester, nor does Bill Daily appear as nutty navigator and neighbor Howard Borden.  The 19th Anniversary special is also included.  It takes place on the day after Bob had a dream about being a Vermont innkeeper named Dick Loudon.  The most surreal moment of the special is when they show a clip of Bill Daily as Major Roger Healey on the ""I Dream Of Jeannie"" TV series.  The bonus disc also includes ""Group Therapy,"" which was recorded in Los Angeles in December of 2013.  It's a nostalgic discussion of the show with Bob Newhart, Peter Bonerz, Bill Daily, Jack Riley, and director Michael Zinberg.  Sadly, Suzanne Pleshette and Marcia Wallace had both passed away, and are sorely missed in the discussion group.  Bob and Bill do show their age, while Peter has held up well.  Sadly, Jack Riley had a stroke, and is confined to a motorized wheelchair.  This look back to when they were all in their prime is bittersweet, as time has taken its toll on all of the participants.  Fortunately, the TV show's comedy is timeless, and has held up very well over the years."
4268,767001311,5,Who is funnier then the great Bob Newhart. It's about time. Great show with lots of laughs. And the price is right. We have been waiting for years. So Glad someone is finally listening to the consumer again. And now we are finally getting Bob's second long running show NEWHART. It's about time. Can't wait for the mail to arrive.
4269,767001311,5,Awesome to have the complete series available. No idea why the previous issue did not finish the series. I will have to sell that one some day.
4270,767001311,5,Am slowly going through the entire series and realizing Bob Newhart and everyone on the show are so fantastically funny--even after all these years.
4271,767001311,5,1of my favorite shows
4272,767001311,1,The distributor really showed their true colors.  Those who had already bought the first several seasons found that the only way they could purchase the last two seasons of the show was to repurchase the disks they already had as part of this boxed set.  From now on we'll just do without until all the seasons are released.
4273,767001311,5,Who doesn't like Bob Newhart. I love Bob and Emily. Some of these episodes are so darn funny.
4274,767001311,5,Hi guys. Let me just say I am extremely satisfied with this set. The fact is that nobody else is going to release the whole series again. So this is the best you're going to get. And it's not bad at all actually. This is one of my favorite 70's series. No. The quality is not consistent but I found that most of the discs were just fine. Some later season episodes were a little washed out in the color department but these were in the minority. Just to have the entire series finally is a dream come true. I got a brand new set for $60. which I thought was a pretty good deal. I was one of the ones who had purchased the previous sets but am really not upset about purchasing them again. It's been a long time and that money was spent many years ago. You can sell them here or on E-bay if you want to re-coup some of your money. I just gave them to people who I know would appreciate them. So if you're a Bob fan definitely get the set.
4275,767001311,5,This is such a great series. I've been watching it every night since I purchased it. I had the earlier double disc collection which I hated. Gave  them away and thanks so much to Shout Factory I'm enjoying this complete collection of THE BOB NEWHART SHOW. Plus comes with bonus features. No disappointment here.
4276,767015525,1,"from a succesfull TV-Series and with actors like Connery, Thurman and Fiennes, they come out with this??? The Script is bad, but the editing even worse. There's nothing going for this movie, even the acting looked bad, the Director didn't have a clue of what he was doing. Don't watch this movie even if you have time to waste, is just not worth it."
4277,767015525,4,"The World`s Best Agents:John Steel (Ralph Fiennes) and Emma Peel (Uma Thruman) are trying to stop a dangerous man (Oscar-Winner:Sean Connery), who wants to play God by taking control of the World`s Weather.
Directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik (National Lampoon`s Christmas Vacation) has made a campy action adventure film, full of non-stop thrills and comedy. This film features a Embarresment Role from Star:Sean Connery. It was a Huge Box Office Flop but Still, the movie is best enjoy, if you don`t take it seriously. Great Production Design by Staurt Craig. Grade:B+."
4278,767015525,1,"This is a botched abortion which shares nothing more than the title with the superb original 1960's series.  The lack of care and scorn for the original material and the audience is shocking.  The writer, director and producer of this calamity, if they have any honor, should repudiate this disgrace.  Trust me, DON'T WATCH IT!!!"
4279,767015525,1,"First of all I'd like to put this review into perspective, I wanted so much to like this movie. I think Ralph Fiennes is a fine actor and whats more I'm Scottish and as is the custom if you're Scottish, I'm one of Sir Sean Connery's greatest fans. He was the best Bond (although Pierce Brosnan's doing a fine job) and great in movies such as The Hill, The Untouchables (even if the accent was a bit ropey), The Hunt For Red October, The Rock, Outland etc. He is a fine ambassador for his nation and the world's greatest living Scotsman by popular acclaim BUT what were you thinking Sir Sean when you made this pile of poo? Didn't you read the script? Or were you too busy banking the cheque?
This movie stinks. Not because a remake of the sixties TV series was a bad idea because it wasn't. Not because the movie didn't have potential because it did. Not because the series had a cult following and the movie had a ready made audience to tap into. No it stinks because it boasts one of the worst scripts ever, with plot-holes you could drive a car through, poor editing, poor special effects, a really (...) supporting performance from Eddie Izzard and perhaps the worst choreographed and directed action scenes you could ever see. Take a bow Mr Jeremiah Chechick (also director of the fine Benny and Joon and the awful National Lampoons Christmas Vacation). The movie also boasts a fine English accent from Uma Thurman but a truly awful acting display not just from her but an incredibly wooden and uncharismatic performance from Ralph Fiennes.
This movie was so bad that Warner Bros. wouldn't even let the critics see it prior to it's theatrical release but word of mouth soon spread about how bad it was and it sunk like a stone anyway. According to Total Film Magazine the movie was originally two and a half hours long and was hacked down to a mere 89 minutes for its theatrical release after a disastrous test screening, thus making Don MacPherson's screenplay (supposedly based on Shakespeares The Tempest) make even less sense. Voted the second worst blockbuster ever made by readers of the UK's Total Film magazine, this movie didn't help anybody's career but particularly harmed Uma Thurman whose previous outing had been the sequally awful Batman and Robin.
The saddest thing is it could have been good and I really did want to like this."
4280,767015525,2,"The rumor that shuttled around a while is that the original script stayed very close to the TV show. The people who developed the film were huge Avengers fans that spent years trying to bring this to the screen and saw it as an art house action movie. When Warner's realized that they didn't have a big budget summer film for 1998,they rushed production on The Avengers, threw a lot of money at it, and more or less told the producers they wanted a big hit. Needless to say, pandering to the masses and doing good ""Avengers"" are incompatible, which the test audiences more or less told the studio execs during test screenings by not liking it at all and getting confused (though I am hard pressed to see how they were any more confused than I ended up) . Unfortunately, take out the sublime strangeness and the film falls apart and makes little sense. Apparently, the studio thought they could rush this out on name power and no real story and maybe make a little money, which is exactly how much they made.
Regarding the film itself, it is gorgeous to look at but painful to watch. The three leads are badly miscast (You can't replace MacNee and Rigg, though Patrick Stewart and Lucy Lawless would have been MUCH more interesting than Fiennes and Thurman) and Sean Connery chews scenery like he hadn't eaten in months. would love the DVD to have loads of extras I am sure are milling about somewhere, including commentary by the director on what happened.
Stick with the TV Show."
4281,767015525,4,"There seems to be a lot of argument over how good is this film.  Some people love it, some loath it.  Actually, it's somewhere in the middle.  I liked it, and found it entertaining.  There are some movies I lose interest in halfway through.  I didn't lose interest here.  There are some films that are so sappy or preachy I turn them off.  This isn't one of them.  It's a decent film, if you don't take it too seriously.  The film may be a bit disjointed, and not entirely believable at times, but it isn't boring.  Most films are not entirely believable, as far as that goes.  So, as long as you're not expecting too much, and are willing to suspend your disbelief (which most films require - come on, Castaway?)  This can be an enjoyable film."
4282,767015525,4,"This isn't a patch on the original TV series (especially that featuring John Steed teamed with the inimitable Emma Peel), but it does capture enough of the 1960's British campiness of the original Avengers to be entertaining.  Some aspects do annoy - such as Uma Thurman's (much though I like her other work, e.g. in Gattaca) attempt to portray some finer shades of the original Emma Peel's characterisations.  But as a stand-in, she's a tad more convincing than is Ralph Fiennes for Steed.  Overall, treat this in the tongue in cheek spirit in which it was probably meant to be taken, and enjoy..."
4283,767015525,1,"""The Avengers"" may be the most dreadful film ever released by a major studio.  A laughable plotline, an infantile screenpaly, an embarrassing script...this movie has it all. If you did not see it in the theaters, by all means rent it (DON'T buy it, for heaven's sake).  Everyone who enjoys movies needs to see this incredible barker. It makes the second half of ""Barton Fink"" seem like best picture material."
4284,767015525,5,I like it. Everyone here is charming.
4285,767015525,1,"I tried not to set my hopes too high but this was ABSOLUTELY awful, and embarrassing to boot. Thurman is a fine Peel and Fienes is quite OK (although there's  not much found in the way of the strange ambivalence (like? love? mere professionalism?) in the relation between Steed and Mrs. Peel from the series), but Connery does this one straight from the teleprompter. No credibility, no presence, no strength.  Arguably his worst performance to date.
The retro-look is too glib, and a sense of humour sorely lacking. The film tries VERY hard to be surrealistic (with the Baddies dressing up as teddybears and not-quite-but-almost Bond-like gadgets) but everything the desperate producers throw at us is hollow (You can almost hear them pleading with the audience: ""Now THIS is really funny and weird? Isn't it? Isn't it?"").
A pathetic excuse for a film, even when not compared to the original Avengers. Give this one a miss. It's REALLY not worth your time.
Best Avengeresque part: Peel trying to escape DeWinter's castle, running through the same hallway over and over again... Oh, and yes, that IS Patrick Macnee's voice as Invisible Jones!"
4286,767001311,5,BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME FOR BOB NEWHART SEASONS 5 & 6.
4287,767001311,5,"This show is hilarious, they do not do comedy like this anymore."
4288,767001311,5,"I grew up watching this series in its original run in the 1970s.  So glad to have all six seasons together.  Really evokes so many fond memories for me as I re-watch these classic sitcom shows from my youth.  I highly recommend this set for fans of The Bob Newhart Show.  No DVD set is perfect, but the negative reviews are overblown here in my opinion.  This is a fun set and I have no regrets after buying it."
4289,767001311,5,"I couldn't be happier with this series, brought back so many childhood memories."
4290,767001311,5,Classic!
4291,767001311,4,"I won't go into as much detail as many other reviewers have with their experiences.  I'll add to the voices that I'm a little disappointed with the video, however, I remember watching the show in syndication on my local station during the 80s and thinking the same thing.  As someone else commented, this show has always had problems where that's concerned.

However, on the bright side, we finally have every season in a well-packaged box set!  I think Shout Factory deserves a pat on the back for giving it to us after such a long wait.  Please don't let the minor video issues keep you from this set.  If you're a fan of the show, I don't think you'll regret this purchase."
4292,767001311,5,"One of the best shows of all time finally makes it to DVD in complete form along with some extras. I had originally purchased the first four seasons when they were released years ago, but didn't hesitate to get this set and it's definitely worth it. The alternate pilot on the extra DVD was entertaining and the recent interview with Bob, Bill, Peter and Jack was really special."
4293,767001311,5,"I previously bought 1st 4 seasons, but 5 and 6 were not available. Now I have them all. Maybe it's me, but the sound of the theme song seems to be off. No big deal, I bought it for the show, one of my all time favorites!"
4294,767001311,5,"Wonderfully put together box set. Video transfer very crisp, notes are entertaining and informative. If you're a Newhart fan this is a must have!!!"
4295,767001311,3,"They could've done a lot more in the name of consistency among the episodes video quality and color saturation. Some are a little pale, some over saturated, some darker than others. But it's better than nothing. At least it's not abridged like the odd couple discs. I'm still fuming over that"
4296,767015525,1,This version of the Avengers doesn't even come close to doing justice to the original series.  It is an absolute disgrace.  The original series was full of fresh ideas and good writing.  The movie is one of the worst remakes of a TV series that I have ever seen.
4297,767015525,4,"The whimsical spirit of the classic TV series is retained in this unbelievably poorly treated adventure film. The studio hacked away about a half-hour's worth of footage after a bad test screening, meaning some may find the plot hard to follow, but all the stuff you need to know is there if you pay attention. Basically, it's the traditional spy story- our heroes battle a diabolical madman with an elaborate scheme for world domination- overlaid with some of the most imaginative, inventive and downright charming imagery seen in any action film. You've got gun-toting grannies, killer teddy bears, robotic bees, Escheresque mazes and all other kinds of hallucinogenic imagery, as suave superagents John Steed and Emma Peel try to foil Sir August De Wynter's plot to control the world's weather. Throw in a Mrs. Peel clone and a traitor in the agents' midst, and you've got a dreamlike narrative that proceeds to a wonderfully tempestuous climax. Fiennes and Thurman are no Macnee and Rigg, but they've got their own appeal and a nicely tender chemistry. Sean Connery as the bad guy appropriately hams it up, and there's a superb supporting cast. The visuals are wonderful (avoiding the phoniness of some attempted camp-fests like BATMAN AND ROBIN), the characters fun, and the overall effect is quite exhilirating. Highly recommended."
4298,767015525,1,"There are some interesting visuals in this painfully bad mess of a film (in particular a scene where the lead characters step out of giant bubbles, for no apparent reason), but that's all the good that's here. Every other aspect is dreadful. The only way to watch this horrendous flop is to turn the sound down & listen to some music you like. Don't put yourself through the torture of listening to the dialogue."
4299,767015525,1,"I grew up in England, hence I tend to feel more affinity with UK based films in general. However, that doesn't save this film from extreme mediocrity. Even the worst 'Tough LA cop fighting the drug cartel' film has more going for it than this.
This film dissapoints in almost all areas. The plot is far fetched and weak. Half the film is set in the 1960s, the other half in the 1990s, and the two halves do not marry well together. The special effects are mediocre. The film even drags down two excellent performers (Sean Connery, Uma Thurmann)who are given so little latitude that they can do nothing to salvage the situation. Overall, the impression is of a very second rate James Bond type movie, with cliches galore.
I'm sorry Amazon, this review isn't going to sell you many copies of this DVD. The only people who would find this very interesting are young producers finding out how not to make an action movie. For me, I'll open another beer and stick to those LA cops."
4300,767015525,1,"I agree with those who commented that this isn't one of those movies that's so bad you have to laugh at it--it's worse. I do remember moaning ""kill me"" once or twice after about 20 minutes of trying to figure out why this movie was ever made. I also remember the intermission, where I was torn between going to McDonald's before they closed and staying to see if the second half was any better. One minute later I was eating a burger and drinking coffee.

Update: In retrospect, I realize this review is utterly useless to anyone who hasn't seen the movie.  It's been a long time since I saw this movie and I've blocked most of it out, but from what little I do remember, it was more of a fashion show than a story.  To this day I have no idea what the plot was.  I assume people who saw the ""Avengers"" TV show back in the 60s (?) might get some subtle references, but from my vantage point this was an utter waste of some very talented actors."
4301,767015525,5,"John and Emma are back and are here to stay via DVD technology. Being on DVD, the aesthetics about the actual episodes are not in question here. More appropriately one may ask how they look. They look good, very good. If you relish a series like ""The Avengers"" or ""Twilight Zone"" you no doubt know about the content of what you are getting. You are more likely concerned about the quality of what you are getting. Like John might say to Emma, ""You scratch my back I'll scratch your back."" Thank Mother.
Much better than the Sean Connery film by the way!"
4302,767015525,1,"THE AVENGERS is, hands down, one of the worst films that I've ever seen (and I've seen quite a few bad ones). I went to see it in the theatres with modest expectations, and proceeded to enjoy exactly 3 minutes of it (the cool opening titles). After that, I sat in astonished silence watching this obviously grossly expensive piece of trash. The fact that one of history's most dignified actors, Sean Connery, manages to give his single bad performance to date, is only one of the negatives on display here. THE AVENGERS occupies that strange void where it's badness can't even be laughed at. This movie is pure trash, and there are very few movies that I heatedly dislike. If you're reading this review and actually plan on buying this movie, I recommend you save your money. I'll never understand how such talented actors and such a large budget can create such disposable junk. Avoid this movie at all costs. Consider yourself warned."
4303,767015525,3,"This big screen productio based on the tv series took alot of hits from the critics-some of it justisfied. However i found this movie to have some redeeming qualities. First of all you had several high quality actors such as Uma Thurman,Sean Connery and Ralph Fiennes. They seemed to be doing a pretty good job but were asked to work with a pretty weak script. I found the special effects and cinematography to be pretty good also. The character interaction was very weak with very little attention given to the reason that Sean Connerys character for instance had such an infacuation with Mrs Peele-that is just one of many weaknesses i found in this film. As stated by film critics one of the main selling points was a chance for Uma Thurman to have her own fashion show(which in itself is not a bad thing).Others critcize it for being so campish and the constant silly banter going on between Mrs. Peel and John Steed. However, give it some credit for trying to stick to the formula that won the original tv series its loyal following. Anyone that follows those episodes will probably agree that this movie more or less stayed along those lines. Anyway,this is another of those movies that i can't really say why but something keeps me popping it back in the dvd player and watching over and over again."
4304,767015525,1,"Wow.  I thought I was in for a treat when I saw the previews for ""The Avengers.""  At least the previews were entertaining.  The beginning of  the movie started out pretty good, but it was downhill from there.
Can we  say, ""movie turns into a fashion show?""  For crying out loud,  every single time Uma left a scene and came back, she had on a new hot  little number for an outfit.  If I wanted to see a fashion show, I would  have stayed home and turned on my cable.
I absolutely love Ralph  Fiennes and Sean Connery.  Most of what they have done I have found  wonderful.  I was sorely disappointed by Sean Connery's role in this movie.  His lines were stilted, he seemed extremely uncomfortable in what he was  doing, and I started to feel sorry for him midway through the movie.  Was  this supposed to happen?  I don't know.
I do understand that this movie  was supposed to represent the quirkiness of the original TV show, but I  didn't buy it.  Perhaps it was starting to grate on my nerves every time  Uma showed up in a different tight-fitting outfit.
The special effects  were about the only redeeming quality in the entire movie.  The bubbles  they walked in, those big mechanical bees, and the high-flying act at the  end were all pretty dang cool.  I just wanted more out of the characters.  I wanted more out of the plot.  I wanted more out of Sean Connery's  villain.  I wanted more out of the relationship between Uma and Ralph.  Perhaps I wanted too much, but when coming right down to the nitty gritty,  that's usually what the criteria is for making what most people consider a  ""good"" movie."
4305,767001311,5,"Totally understand the people who hoped the last seasons would be released separately; many personal budgets are tight.
But after so long, it really was time for the complete series to be available no matter how it was issued.
This is a funny, well-written show, and I'm ecstatic to have every episode, even with minor edits.
Love ya Bob and Co., and thanks Shout Factory!"
4306,767001311,5,very nice funny to watch. glad to have got the series
4307,767001311,1,"Shout hasn't released Rhoda season 5 so I have no hopes of them doing the right thing and releasing Bob's seasons 5 & 6.
Capitalism. The only way to make them do right is through consequence. By not purchasing their products."
4308,767001311,1,"Just adding another voice to the crowd. I've been gritting my teeth for eight years (well, a little less since it took a little time to realize that Fox was screwing us over) over not getting the rest of the series. I've always liked Shout! Factory; I've considered them the Rhino for the new millennium in terms of putting out product that really delivers for fans. But this is just unacceptable. Another reviewer mentioned that he'd spoken to Shout about it and that they plan to release seasons 5 and 6 individually. But a) it may not happen, and 2) it's still not cool making us wait. How on earth do you justify a release like this? Where's the logic? Did NO ONE at Shout look at the countless reviews (and IMDB message boards, for that matter) decrying the absence of the last two seasons? I don't have the market research numbers, of course, but I imagine that a significant percentage of potential buyers for this were in my situation. The ratings and reviews here certainly bear it out. I very much want the last two seasons of ""The Bob Newhart Show,"" but I'm not about to pay this much to get four seasons I already own and, more importantly, support this misstep. Shout and other studios, take notice: if we don't refuse to buy it, how will you learn?"
4309,767001311,5,"Brilliant comic.  Zany, talented cast."
4310,767001311,5,"To get close captioning you need to have your TV set to close caption and then use RCA cables. Component cables may work, I don't know. Hdmi does not work for close captioning on these discs."
4311,767001311,5,"If you are a Bob Newhart fan you will love this! I know most of us didn't get to view each episode of the series, ... so here is your chance! Great set and the price was right!"
4312,767001311,5,"Finally all 6 seasons.  Great quality discs, packaging, video, audio and of course, an awesome series.  Kudos as always to Shout Factory.  One thing though.  Did anyone else notice the big misprint in the included book and the DVD menus where they show the doctor's office as 751, but in the show it is 715?  Hmmmmm"
4313,767001311,5,"Have been waiting for someone to publish the complete series.  We have loved watching the reruns, but now we can ""binge"" to our hearts content."
4314,767001311,5,"I've waited a long time for this collection to be available and it does not disappoint!  Of the 3 TV series that Newhart did over the years, this original is the best.  As a former Chicagoan, I love seeing the city backdrop and I think the show holds up pretty well over time.  Now, all that's left is for the second series (set in Vermont) to be available as a complete series from a professional source.  I have it from an amateur source and the episodes are spotty as to quality, some even being unintelligible.  Anyway, this series is fantastic.  I haven't looked at the 'extras' DVD yet, but I'm expecting good things!"
4315,767015525,1,"Hoping the re-make would get the spirit of the old series I bought this DVD ... and would like to warn everybody to repeat that mistake. Jokes are  forced, dialogues are flat, there is no suspense and the respective  superiors (""Father"" and ""Mother"") are just ridiculised.  Boring. A nuisance. Stay away from it !"
4316,767015525,5,"I loved this silly little movie. The people who didn't most likly didn't watch or didn't like the T.V. show. Come on people this movie was supposed to be silly, I'm not sure if the T.V. show was or not (but it was anyway).  Don't get me wrong I loved the show just a well and at times better than  this movie. I did think the ""Mother""/""Father"" stuff  went a bit far, even that wasn't that bad. It was nice to see (or rather  not see) Patrick Macnee (the orignal John Steed) as an invisible man. Where  was Diana Rigg. I would highly recommend this silly little movie to anyone.
ENJOY!"
4317,767015525,4,"Dry, arch...this could be Monument Valley, but tis an apt description of an underrated film. The original John Steed has been described as a man NSIT (Not Safe In Taxis)and the latest incarnation, the talented Mr Ralph  Fiennes, is equally seductive(check out the leather boot scene, mmmm...).  The killer bees, suprising nuns and decapitated teddy bears are in the  spirit of the original show, as is the fencing in the gentleman's  outfitters.  Only mistake, and huge mistake at that, was at the end,  allowing Steed and Peel to... Innuendo abounding, subtle and witty  thoughout, so why? tell me why was THAT necessary? Smacks of pandering to  the lowest common denom'. I can only hope a ""Director's Cut"" will  be issued; in the words of Steed, '...hurry back'."
4318,767015525,3,"Though an ultimate disappointment to AVENGERS fans, and especially to viewers being first introduced to the AVENGERS mythos, the film at least takes a while to show its bad side.  The opening 45 minutes is  smashing-which is perhaps why the ending is so frustrating.
The main  reason for this let-down is not the ridiculousness of the plot. MISSION  IMPOSSIBLE, most Bond films, and even JURASSIC PARK have all had commercial  success with plots that weren't much better than this.  Rather, the failure  of this film comes in my mind from Sean Connery.  If this were the only  example of his acting one had ever seen, one would have difficulty seeing  how the man ever won an Oscar (R).  His performance is truly abysmal.  Yes,  the situations he's placed in and the lines themselves have a certain  hollowness to them, but all meglomaniacs in all action films are, well,  silly.  Though I do think one or two scenes exploring a bit more of de  Wynter's character might've been in order, films have been more satisfying  with less-scripted villains.  The glaring difficulty is that Connery  obviously doesn't *believe* in his character.  It's absolutely obvious that  he's not having fun-even with the good lines.  As a result, we don't  either.
By contrast, Fiennes and Thurman are having the time of their  lives, playing roles that seem to have been tailor-made for them, despite  having originated with other actors.  There are really no scenes which  their presence doesn't immediately help, and one can't help but feel that  if the movie had simply had a different actor cast as the villain, their  chemistry would've gone better appreciated by the viewing public.
(DVD  notes: There are really no additional features on the DVD, which is  surprising.  The production team were all huge fans of the TV show and  spent years trying to bring this puppy to screen.  One would've thought  they'd have been absolutely passionate about trying to explain what had  been a big part of their lives for years.)"
4319,767015525,3,"--and that's why it gets three stars. Part of the fun of this film is filling in the blanks where, if the trailer is to be trusted, there may have been explanatory scenes. (Speaking of the trailer, my dvd has only  one, despite the ""Six Theatrical Trailers"" advertised on the  packaging.) E.g., Good Emma and Bad Emma are obviously ""enhanced""  clones created by de Wynter, whose wife was the template--her huge portrait  hangs in his mansion. (This is not to claim that I've untangled all of the  film's apparent flaws.) I also enjoyed the pervasive umbrella imagery,  'cause brollies are neat.
And I've never seen the original tv series, but  I gather that many of the elements in the film harken back to particular  episodes."
4320,767015525,3,"I was a fan of the original TV series when the A&E network aired it back in the early 1990's.  I waited with much anticapation when I started to see photos of the film.  Then came the trailer.  WOW!  I couldn't wait  to see the film.  But to find out that the folks at Warner Bros. didn't let  advanced sneak peek for critics to see this, you knew something was wrong.  So there I was waiting to see this and found out how horrible the reviews  were.  When I finally saw the movie I thought scenes were missing.  What  does this mean?  We were jipped!  False advertising from the WB!  The  movie to my mind is OK, but all the missing scenes were in the darn  trailer!  There were really absurd moments (the Teddy Bears were the  funniest to the audience at the theater).  I thought the worst was the lack  of explanation for Bad Emma.  How did she come to be?  The original Steed,  Patrick Macnee reduced to being invisible?  It'd been great to see the two  Steeds side by side.  Uma was OK but sure looked uncomfortable doing a  British accent.  She looked great in the leather outfit though!  Ralph as  Steed I thought was the best acting in film.  Seemed a more silent, maybe  dark Steed?  Connery as the villain was OK but his objections should've  been more realistic.  The Alice character seemed to me the highlight of  this film for something that worked.  The movie did seem to be a combined  mixture of a couple Avenger episodes. But to adapt it as the 1960's was  wrong. They should've put it into the 1990's.  The movie is OK and for that  it ain't so bad.  The missing scenes are needed.  Mrs Peel, we're needed to  find the complete film print edition!"
4321,767015525,1,"A Movie that just tries to hard to be clever & succeeds only in making the film worse and driving the viewer closer & closer to despair. Plot - Well not Much can be said for it since it really was awful, Did you care  what happened? Did anyone come across well? No!  The shame was that the  potential was there but unforunately this mix of a typical Hollywood Plot  & the sureallism that was attempted failed dismally. It's a pity though  , I felt that Thurman & Fiennes made a good Steed & Mrs Peel, pity  they had nothing to work with."
4322,767015525,2,"Why does Hollywood waste its budget on movies based on 50's, 60's, or 70's TV shows?  Can't anybody think for themselves anymore?  Films like these give good actors bad reputations, and Ralph Fiennes, Sean Connery, and Uma  Thurman are great actors.  The three of them must've been trying to hang  themselves after the theater release."
4323,767015525,1,"If you have to read a novelization to fill in the plot holes, it isn't worth doing.
No matter who is to blame for this travesty, be it editor, director, screenwriters, the terribly lethargic performances from Thurman  and Fiennes (I personally would lay the blame at the feet of the lot of  them), it isn't worth the time or money.
I'm not even much of a fan of  the original, having only watched an episode or two if that, but this- this  is a pathetic film.
There is zero chemistry between the two stars, Sean  Connery hams it up (and with dialogue like his, can you blame him?) and the  plot, as has previously been stated, well.. saying it ""has holes""  is an understatement of the first order.
An amateurish effort all around.  Who would have throught that a film with Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, and  Sean Connery would be so... boring?  I wouldn't even give it one star, but  I'm being told that that isn't an option."
4324,767015525,1,"This film is a real treat for the eyes, especially on a properly calibrated monitor.  It is also a very satisfying audio experience in Dolby Digital 5.1.  Unfortunately, the script does not even come close to the  quality of the video transfer or the soundtrack.  The first 20-30 minutes  of the film are an amusing reminder of the charm of the old TV series, but  things fall apart quickly after that.  The perils introduced by the  antagonist, Sean Connery, are unbelievable in the extreme.  No amount of  surreal interpretation can convince the viewer that they are anything but  ridiculous.  The gross incompetence of many characters is evident as both  good and evil fail repeatedly to accomplish even the simplest of tasks to  which they set themselves.  Even if one is able to get past the silly  devices and look only at the story, the narrative is mundane and  predictable.  If it were not for the fabulous transfer to DVD and the  delicious Ms. Thurman, I don't believe I could have gotten any farther than  one-third of the way through this mess.  As it was, I only got to the  (anti) climactic end battle because I couldn't find my remote."
4325,767001311,1,"as most reviewers i have had seasons 1-4 since they came out.  so far i have only watched season 5.  the picture/audio quality are definitely worse than that of those earlier releases.  i can try to ignore that, but in the end that's impossible, since the audio is horribly out of sync.  gosh darn it!!  bad job, shout.  certainly, if you have to have seasons 5 and 6, wait till they come out individually.  my impatience got me, in the end."
4326,767001311,1,"After waiting years for the full set (and buying the first four seasons as stand alone DVDs) I am incredibly disappointed in the Shout Factory set - the quality is terrible. The sound is off, the video quality is terrible on some of the disks - I can barely see the picture and the color is completely wrong. It is not my tv - it is some of the disks."
4327,767001311,5,"Bought the complete series after waiting forever for seasons 5 & 6 to come out (never did.)  Love the packaging.  The only thing I would have added is closed captioning, which I need to use sometimes."
4328,767001311,5,"My husband has been (im)patiently waiting for years for the entire show's release on DVD.  This is a hilarious comedy series, full of terrific characters and way ahead of the time in which it was written.  Truly just as funny now as it was then.  It is also great fun to watch the clothing and decor from ""back in the day"" and the chemistry between Bob, Emily and the rest of the ensemble cast."
4329,767001311,5,I loved the Bob Newhart Show and had heard that a boxed set of the entire six seasons was out.  The price from Amazon was the lowest one I found.  Fast delivery too.
4330,767001311,4,"I think this is one of the best sitcoms of the '70s.  The cast of characters were all excellent in their roles and the humor was not like the juvenile crap that passes for humor now on television.  When I saw it was being released on video I pounced because I think this was Newhart at his best.  His show as the innkeeper had some funny moments, but not the wit of this show."
4331,767001311,3,"Finally all episodes are available.  But the image and sound quality are undoubtedly from film-to-tape transfers dating back to the 1980s.  No effort was made here to source the original film, ala ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" and its flawless Blu-ray collection.  So, settle for something rather than nothing with this box set.  Having all the episodes in fair condition is much better than none."
4332,767001311,5,"Three cheers for the Shout Factory for giving us this great set, after 20th Century Fox refused to release the last two seasons. This is beautifully packaged and far superior to the product 20th Century Fox gave us for Seasons 1-4."
4333,767001311,1,"I've read the various comments to the effect that the complete series is a good value at $80, and that SHOUT FACTORY should not be held accountable for  the actions of FOX.

1. SHOUT FACTORY was more than well aware of the history of the series release. Why did they choose to release the entire series rather than seasons 5 and 6? Would they have us believe they felt the majority of individuals inclined to purchase the Bob Newhart sat out the first 4 seasons in the hope that SHOUT FACTORY would come along and release the entire series at a great price? They new quite well that fans already owned the first 4 seasons, and bet that they would pay a hefty price to get the remaining two. Their offer to release seasons 5 and 6 now, after numerous complaints, is a bit lame.

2.$80 is a great price for the series if you don't already own the individual seasons, but where is this market? Most fans who are inclined to by DVD'S of the series at all, have already bought one or more seasons. Individuals who are not familiar with the show and would like to ""try it out"", may buy one or two seasons to see if they like it. I doubt they would spring for the entire series.

3. Fans are being unfairly faulted for ""jumping the gun"" , and purchasing the first 4 seasons as they were offered. We believed that the studio would act in good faith , and , in time, release all 6 seasons. They didn't. Had we not purchased the seasons when they were initially offered, further releases would have been concelled in any event."
4334,767001311,2,"Despite what other reviewers are guessing to be true, the video quality of the episodes in seasons 1-4 in this complete series set is NOT an upgrade from the original DVD season releases. I have done an extensive side-by-side comparison and the transfer is unquestionably inferior with the new set. Colors are washed out, detail and definition are reduced. It's a very stark contrast. The video bitrates are markedly higher for the old discs vs. the new. I'm noticing bitrates that are as much as 30% higher in the head-to-head comparison.

Perhaps most importantly, there is for some reason a significant variation in quality from episode to episode in the new set. The last one or two episodes on each disc are consistently and inexplicably much lower in quality than the other episodes on the disc. This is not the case with the older set. Take Season 1, Disc 3 for example: it contains eight episodes, and the first six average around 1.03 GB in raw size. But the last two episodes (""Bum Voyage"" and ""Who's Been Sleeping on My Couch?"") come in around 780-800 MB. If that 30% difference doesn't sound bad to you, trust me when I say it is very noticeable, particularly with a 40-year old series shot on film. The older discs have no such variations in quality; the same episodes in that set consistently come in around 1.09 Gb each. Size isn't always a true indicator of video quality but in this case it holds true. Many episodes in the new set  just look plain bad, like they have been through an additional transfer generation or two.

However, the ""Complete Series"" set is the only way to get your hands on the final two seasons, so if you own the older discs, my recommendation would be to make your own set with seasons 1-4 from the season discs and 5-6 from the new set. I can't comment on the bonus features as I haven't viewed them yet. But the episode commentaries are all still here and there doesn't seem to be anything new in that department.

Another difference that may matter to you: the new set does not include subtitles, whereas the old discs have both English and Spanish subtitles. It seems Shout! Factory left them out as part of their misguided effort to cram as many episodes on each disc as possible. I'm no fan of the double-sided disc format Fox used for the season releases, and it's a pain to switch the discs more often with fewer episodes per disc, but I'll take them over the new set any day."
4335,767015525,1,"Tiresome, absurd, and senseless plot, but the kiddies might enjoy it for the special effects and cartoon like action sequences.  I wish I could say it was the worst movie I've seen in awhile, but the Mod Squad has that  honor.  A total disgrace to the original TV series."
4336,767015525,5,a film that has 125 reviews can not be bad. please show your mercy!
4337,767015525,5,"This one of the best movies ever made. My favorite Actress, Uma Thurman is in it, which makes it evan more great! I recomend this movie to everyone."
4338,767015525,1,Truly a great example that no amount of special effects can replace a plot. The avengers had no plot!
4339,767015525,5,"It is just great. I don't know what you all amerikaans lack but this just a movie where is none alike. Great FX, and great cast. And a nice english accent. Last but not least a good transfer to DVD."
4340,767015525,2,"Standing on its own, the film is probably no worse and no better than the average action film: it's more an occasion for special effects,  unexpected situations, special effects, stylish banter, special effects, spectacularly  dispatching the villain, and more special effects than anything else. Seen  from that point of view, noone would complain much about Big Ben exploding  in such a spectacular manner when Sir August de Wynter lets loose his  out-and-out weather attack on London: it's just what this kind of film is  about. They only poison in jest, to borrow an expression
  And seen from  that angle, noone would really expect anything out of the ordinary: it's  just a bit of fun, and need not be very believable. However, the comic  relief that most good action films  produce over a bit of unbelieavable  action is largely missing: the characters are too serious for that. There's  a fairly reasonable fencing scene at Trubshawe's, but when Mrs. Peel turns  her back on Steed and walks away from him, while still defending herself  against his attacks from behind, it goes over the line of being  belieavable, and turns into nothing more than a well choreographed action  sequence in a film, and so becomes a bit obtrusive: my suspension of  disbelief broke down very badly here.
  I came to this film with a  considerable dose of the original Avengers in my memory: in particular the  years when Diana Rigg played Mrs. Peel againt Patrick Macnee as John Steed.  That's probably unfair: the film cannot stand that kind of comparison.
  The original relationship between Mrs. Peel and John Steed is gone. They're  no longer cooperating; instead Mrs. Peel is under grave suspicions of  sabotaging the Prospero weathershield, and Steed is to keep a check on her.  And so the occasionally bright patter, which in the original was more an  expression of the protagonists' relationship, here turns into something  more like fencing with sharp weapons.
  Mother -- that rather poor  attempt to explain ""the Ministry"" for which the original Avengers  worked -- is here, and with Father, looking like Dr. Strangelove's twin  brother, as an extra burden:  one lame, the other blind. Again, my  disbelief-suspenders had a very  hard time with Father.  Colonel I. Jones  is more like the spirit of the original, but that may have something to do  with the fact that Patrick Macnee is ""appearing"" in that cameo  part.
  It's a bit as if a film historian had found a set of reviews, and  some odd script fragments from the original TV series, and then set about  to recreate the original from those bits and pieces, while not entirely  being able to  free himself from an old dream of writing the next big James  Bond film.
  The best way to appreciate this film is to forget the  original Avengers entirely, if possible.  Those who haven't seen the TV  episodes have a huge advantage here."
4341,767015525,1,"As a fan of the original Avengers t.v. series I have to say that I was so excited when this movie was previewed with what I thought would be an outstanding cast that I can hardly contain my displeasure at how  predictable, boring and stupid this film was.  Although the performances  were credible the story was so bad that I wish I could get the price of  admission back.
Save your money.  Trust me!"
4342,767015525,5,This film has such a British wit.  I like this film rgardless of what others say about this movie.  Uma thurman is an astounding actress. She was witty and charming.  She knew her lines and what to say in this movie and  you have to admit this movie is better than Batman And Robin. She had such  beautiful alburn hair in this film.  I think the Avengers is worth seeeing  so please buy it or rent it!
4343,767015525,1,"This movie was a complete disaster. I have been a long time fan of Sean Connery, he is one of my all-time favourite actors, but it is beyond my comprehension why he accepted the role in this really bad movie. The  original avengers was one of the best series ever produced. Most of my  lunch breaks at university were spent watching Patrick MacNee and Diana  Rigg and they were extremely enjoyable times. This attempt at reviving  interest in The Avengers has failed dismally."
4344,767015525,1,"This quite possibly could be the worst movie made in the past 20 years. The story was almost completely unfollowable, the stunts and effects were silly, and for the life of me I still don't get the giant teddy bears.  Fiennes and Thurman have absolutley no chemistry together, and when they  attempt to have a witty conversation, they come off as petulant children  (I'm wittier than you - no I'm wittier, etc.). Do yourelf a favor and avoid  buying this at all costs. If you still have an insane urge to see it, try  to catch it on late night cable."
4345,767001311,1,Those of us who have been buying each season as they were released now find that we have to repurchase seasons 1-4 as part of the box set if we want to get the last two seasons.  That won't be me.  It makes me very angry that the biggest fans once again get the short end of the stick.  Booo.....you moneygrubbers.
4346,767001311,1,I already own seasons 1 - 4 and like many others have been waiting for 5 & 6. I can continue living a happy life without buying the complete set of 6 seasons. Feels like extortion to me. I am not going to buy it this way!!!!
4347,767001311,1,"Come on, Shout Factory. Give the people what they want. Seasons 5 & 6! Seasons 5 & 6! Seasons 5 & 6!"
4348,767001311,5,"Episode 140 has a minor edit, sadly. It is the episode where Carol quits Bob and Jerry and goes to work for Mr. Carlin. What is cut is Bob singing the line 'TO DREAM THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM"".... I have an uncut copy made in the 80's from a local TV station. I guess the rights were too expensive."
4349,767001311,5,"I see A LOT of reviewers condemning Shout Factory, for releasing this set. They seem to believe that this new offering, is an attempt by Shout Factory to ""double dip"", and make extra money from those who already purchased seasons 1-4.

This is NOT the case.

The company that released seasons 1-4, abandoned the prospect of putting out the final two seasons.

Shout Factory is simply giving fans of the show, exactly what they've been waiting for. They should be receiving PRAISE for this...not condemnation, and a slew of 1 star reviews.

My set arrived today. I've watched 4 episodes, so far, and the video quality of seasons 1-4 is at least identical to the transfers of the original set. However, with the Shout! release you get an upgrade from those awful two-sided discs. In my opinion, the single-sided Shout! discs are worth making the purchase.

Also, these are the complete episodes...they are NOT the shortened syndicated versions.

I say, chuck out those sets (seasons 1-4), and buy this COMPLETE SERIES box set. It's easily worth the price, and the image quality is so much sharper.

It's a no brainer. This new set is better."
4350,767001311,1,"I've been weary of something like this happening. Roseanne and Cosby were released in their chopped up syndicated versions instead of the original... which version are these?
Also...
It's really great that this series finally came out completely... but what about those of us who YEARS AGO  bought seasons 1-4... waited patiently for the rest... and want the rest of it? Do we just chuck out DVDs we paid as much as $49.95 a piece just to get the last seasons?"
4351,767001311,5,"Com'on people, lighten up.  We've been waiting 8 years for this.  This is a different distributor, so we should understand they were probably not going to ""pick right up where Fox left off"".  It's not like this is going to be a huge seller.  As much as we love the series, we are WAY in the minority here.  At best, the individual seasons would sell for $15 to $20.  So instead of paying $40 for the final two, for another $40 you get the whole series, in a matched set.  Life is too short, I'm not going to let something this insignificant keep me from viewing clean, unedited versions of my favorite series of all time.

My current set I recorded off of Nick probably 15 years ago, transferred to MPEG files about 12-13 years ago, cut and edited them with some cheesy video editor from the early 2000's, and got them down to around 750 MB so that each would fit on a CD.  My backups have also clogged up my hard drives over the years.  $79 to get rid of all this headache and have the complete series? Bargain!!!!

Thanks for the wonderful series Mr. Newhart, just a timeless classic that we love so much.  The Doctor is IN!!!

ADDED 5/27:  Got the set in today, worth the money.  I haven't compared the quality to the 4 Season set from Fox, but I did compare a couple of episodes to my mpeg versions I recorded 15 or so years ago.  The episodes are un-cut, which is great, but one other thing I noticed right off the bat is the episodes are the correct speed.  Syndication cuts episodes, but they also tend to speed them up to get more of the episode into the allotted 30 minute air time.  I was really surprised how much quicker the pace was on the old recordings, with all of the actor's voices a little higher as a result.  The new set is much more naturally-paced, more relaxed.  The video of the new set is not perfect, but it is very, very good.  I give it about 8.5 on a 1-10 scale.  It doesn't have that super clean, prisitine look of a big name series that has been fully restored from top-notch source elements.  But it is certainly cleaner than any Newhart episodes I have seen before, including the Fox videos.  The video is excellent for the most part and is consistent from episode to episode.  The audio is great, much cleaner than my recorded set which had a lot of hissing.  It is perfect for a 70's sitcom, I give the audio a 9.5 out of 10.

In any case, the purchase was well worth the $79.  Season 5 is one of my favorites, so I'm going to really enjoy the new set, and not worry about the $40 extra.  All in all..... ""Fine and Dandy""!!"
4352,767001311,1,"I've already purchased seasons 1 through 4 as many other people also have. Now I'm informed that I cannot buy seasons 5 and 6 separately! That means I have to spend $80 which amounts to $40 per season to get the last 2 and get stuck with the first 4 seasons again.

Well I guess that means I won't have seasons 5 and 6!"
4353,767001311,4,I always liked this show when it originally aired.  Bob Newhart is at his best playing a low-key everyman that quietly reacts to all the lunacy that surrounds him.  In this series he plays a psychologist which is a creative way of introducing some quirky characters for him to respond to (not that his friends and co-workers aren't quirky enough themselves).  The show ran out of steam the last couple of seasons when supposedly Newhart wanted to end the series but was talked into staying. It is still a fun show with a lot of good memories.
4354,767001311,1,"I ""preordered"" seasons 5 & 6 and waited patiently for at least two years.  This is totally unfair to require those of us who own the first 4 seasons to buy duplicates in order to finish our set.  Would Bob Newhart approve of this?  I don't think so."
4355,767015525,1,"I love movies and I'll sit through almost anything. I almost walked out on this one, but I stuck it through to the end. What a mistake! Bad script, bad acting.... Trust me, save your money."
4356,767015525,1,"I loved the TV show.  The surreal situations, the action, but mostly the clever banter between Peel and Steed.  And it is mostly for lack of the latter, that this film doesn't work.  Where there should be lightning quick  exchanges there are holes in the repartee you can drive a Mack Truck  through.
Uma Thurman was a poor choice to play Emma Peel.  Her English  accent sounds awkward and contrived.  Often she accents the wrong word  within a phrase giving the impression that 1) she doesn't understand the  meaning of the lines she's delivering 2) she's reading her lines from cue  cards.
Let's face it, big budget production values aside, without the  Peel/Steed repartee and chemistry there was no point in making this  movie.
Spend your money wisely.  Buy the videos of the TV show instead."
4357,767015525,1,"I knew I had to see it as I am a fan of the TV series.  It's almost as if the writers watched a few old episodes, picked up a few ideas and threw them into the script.  Absolutely NOTHING worked, the daft things Steed did (like the tea making  in the car) worked in the TV show because it was done with style; in the  film it came over as  pathetic.  Uma Thurman is no Diana Rigg; she can't  act and was totally inept."
4358,767015525,1,This was awful in every way a movie can be.  I cannot believe this movies average rating right now is 2.5 stars.  What is there to like?
4359,767015525,1,"How did this movie get released? This movie is an excellent example of why directors should not be allowed to go unsupervised. And what the heck is Sean Connery doing in this? I fell asleep while watching this (really).  When I awoke, I glanced at my wife, and discovered that she was also  asleep. Bad. Very bad. Watch the TV show instead, and let's pretend this  movie never happened (like Mission Impossible)."
4360,767018699,5,Always liked the Tara King episodes.
4361,767018699,5,"Love the original Avengers series, watched them all as a kid in black and white."
4362,767018699,5,"the price is too much, but the movie is great"
4363,767018699,4,The Avengers a good old 60's British series I truly enjoyed watching  Steed & Mrs Peel were excellent together. The English background scenes and all the different villains made this tv series brilliant.
4364,767018699,5,great show and VHS still works at a reasonable price.
4365,767018699,5,My DVDs arrived on time and they're just great brings back a lot of memories
4366,767018699,4,all was good to see
4367,767018699,5,OK
4368,767018699,5,I love the vintage Avengers.  This set of episodes is exciting and contains some that I have not seen before.  I recommend these editions of the Avengers to anyone who appreciates the show as it appeared back in 1967.
4369,767018699,5,"A fantastic trip down memory lane. This box set of the 60's TV series ""The Avengers"" is an absolute treat. Diana Rigg as the sexy and very beautiful Emma Peel a long with Patrick Macnee's John Steed made the series a must watch on Friday nights when I was a kid. I highly recommend this DVD collection for anyone who was and still is an Avengers fan."
4370,767015525,2,It gets 2 stars because I actually didn't fall asleep
4371,767015525,1,"This movie is the one of the top ten worst films I have ever seen.  The story makes no sense whatsoever, the characters are very wooden (all three of them), and most of the effects were thrown in to waste money (flying  mechanical bees?  give me a break).  This movie was a waste of $60 million  dollars to the studio that made it, and it will be a waste of 2 hours of  your life if you make the mistake of buying it.  Please, for the love of  God, avoid this movie at all costs!"
4372,767001311,1,I have to second everyone else's emotion.  This is unfair that we have to buy a whole box set to gets seasons 5 and 6 when most of us already bought 1 - 4.  I am very disappointed.  I have been diligently waiting for a long time for the rest of the series.
4373,767001311,4,"Box set won't be out for another month or so, but I'll go out on a limb, and predict greatness.

Hope they cleaned up the transfers. The original releases of the first 4 seasons were pretty poor.

There's nobody like Newhart. Watch and see.

ADDED: To the various dissenters (crybabies) who think they have to buy Seasons 1-4 again, Shout plans on selling Seasons 5 and 6 separately. So, be patient, and stop whining."
4374,767001311,5,"Looks like I'm the first reviewer to have actually received and viewed (at least in part) this set, having pre-ordered it from Shout who delivered it five weeks before the official release date.

BACKGROUND: The Bob Newhart Show is my favorite show in the history of television. I've bought every VHS and DVD release available over the years, and have been making recordings off the air for 20 years in an effort to collect (and then ""upgrade"" the quality of) all the episodes in this series. My expectations for this set are high since the show deserves the best DVD release possible. Fox released the first four seasons in 2005 and 2006, only to leave fans hanging for 8 years for the last two seasons. Luckily, Shout Factory took the opportunity to release the Bob Newhart Show the way it should have been from the beginning - as a complete series set. Yes, this means hardcore fans like me have DVDs, VHS tapes, and old DVD-R recordings that we don't need anymore. So sell the old ones or give them away. To me it's a small price to pay to get this set.

THE SHOW ITSELF: Not much to say other than what you likely already know - The Bob Newhart Show is generally regarded as one of the greatest sitcoms of all time. Its rare combination of amazing writing, a top-notch cast, and a style of humor that is at once accessible and sophisticated, is a high water mark in the history of television.

PACKAGING: The set comes in a standard height box with 3 Amaray-style cases that holds 6 discs apiece. Gone are the two-sided Fox discs with cheesy cartoon-themed menus. Here, discs for Seasons 1 and 2 are in one case, seasons 3 and 4 in a second case and seasons 5 and 6 are in the third case. These are NOT stacked on a spindle and thus are easily accessible. The disc faces feature nice 1970s-inspired artwork across all discs with color variations for each case. The fourth (bonus disc) case is a standard height but slim. The menus for each disc are based on the look of Bob's office door. Everything is classy and everything matches.

AUDIO AND VIDEO QUALITY: The Bob Newhart Show has always had quality issues on broadcast and video release as far back as I remember, and sadly this release is no exception. Over the years I've assumed that the transfers we've seen are taken from either second-generation prints, 16mm dupes, or analog-sharpened film-to-tape transfers. Other sitcoms shot on film in this era look better. If anybody has inside information on the condition of the original or edited film elements I'd love to know the story. So generally the contrast on most episodes it too high and harsh looking, there is a lot of grain, and most episodes are pretty de-saturated and the color temperature is too magenta in my opinion. Sound is also a bit harsh and thin in most episodes. My guess is that Shout has used the best original material available, and I have certainly never seen this series look or sound better than it does in this DVD set. So it's just decent, and probably limited to being so just by the nature of the source material.

EXTRAS: Every episode I've watched so far is uncut and runs about 25 minutes. Shout appears to have carried over the commentary tracks from the Fox discs. The 40-page booklet is very nicely designed, well written by sitcom expert Vince Waldron, and organized so you can find the episode titles, plot summaries, and airdates easily. The 19th Anniversary reunion show from 1991 is a 1-hour ""clip show"" that is just okay. It's nice to see the actors again, but not much actually happens other than setting up the clips which are (by themselves) great. The ""Group Therapy"" extra is a sit-down studio conversation with cast and crew that is very entertaining and insightful and lasts most of an hour. The unaired pilot is a real treat, and is quite different from the show as we would know it later.

CONCLUSION: It great to finally see this show get the treatment it deserves with this Complete Series DVD release. The packaging, tasteful and consistent menus and disc artwork, full-length episodes, and extras are a fitting presentation. Other than some picture and sound quality issues that are probably inherent in the source material, there's little room for improvement in this set. Unless somebody finds some ""lost"" negatives or higher-quality masters in a vault or basement somewhere and makes a high-def blu-ray transfer of them, this is probably the best presentation of the Bob Newhart Show we will ever get. Overall well worth the money and a set to be re-watched for many years to come. The concept and execution of ""the sitcom"" just doesn't get any better than the Bob Newhart Show, specifically as it is delivered in this DVD set. Enjoy!"
4375,767001311,3,Got boned by FOX by not releasing Seasons 5 and 6. Thanks to Shout Factory for helping undo FOX's wrongs !!
4376,767001311,1,I already own seasons 1 through 4. Do they really think I am going to buy the whole series only to get seasons 5 and 6????
4377,767001311,3,"It's a real shame to give this DVD set a 1-star rating, but I have to.  I've spent a lot of money for seasons 1-4 (about $100 I figure) and have waited many years for the final two seasons.  The decision to require people like me to repurchase the first four seasons to see the rest of series is reprehensible.  It's a wonderful show - Thank you Bob Newhart, et al.  But the marketing of this product is insulting to many.

UPDATE:  Due to the fact that seasons 5 & 6 have been released separately I will add an extra star to my rating for each season, bringing it to 3 stars."
4378,767001311,3,"Shout is an amazing company that gives old TV series a real boost in cleaning up the picture and audio. I have the Fox releases and I hated the audio. I will gladly double dip for those four seasons and the two remaining seasons. Thanks Shout!

***Update June 3, 2014***

Picture and audio quality - no different from the FOX releases. That's sad. I am mixed on this set and am changing my five star review to a three star."
4379,767001311,1,"Been waiting long but now I've got to buy the whole set? Anyone want seasons 1-4? Thought not.
What a cheesey way to make money"
4380,767001311,5,"Got the four Fox seasons for Christmas.  I knew the series was incomplete, and I figured the DVDs would be carelessly thrown-together, and I was right.  They are total, murky, chopped-up, mumble-mouthed, double-sided crap.  Then a month or two later I discovered the whole series is to be released.  Having experienced Shout Factory's reverent approach to other classic sitcoms, I am more than happy to shell out for the complete series so I can re-watch the shows properly and have the last two seasons.  I'll just give away the badly-produced Fox ones.  The box set is a convenient way to purchase these, and I'm sure Shout Factory has reasons for its pricing (still less than $20.00 per season): the correct theme songs for the correct episodes, uncut episodes, re-mastered picture and sound quality, plenty of extras, maybe permissions for music heard by the characters.  Very exciting."
4381,767001311,5,"As of the date of this posting, Shout Factory's website has the complete set for 99.99, AND you get the set a full month before street date (you get it on 04/22/14). I still give the set 5 stars here though, because the show was amazing and it sounds as though the extras for the set are great."
4382,767015525,1,"I saw this movie with almost no expectations--I'd seen almost all of the '67 series on video before seeing this--but I was still incredibly disappointed.  Steed and Peel don't come across as witty and smart; their  dialogue seems stilted and geared to one-up each other (""I'm wittier  than you."" ""No, I'm wittier than you."" ""No, I'M wittier  than YOU."" etc.)  There was almost no chemistry between the stars,  which is what held the TV show together.  There also seemed to be a lot cut  out as the plot really didn't explain what Prospero was about and how  DeWynter's weather generating equipment would work against it.  The weather  equipment also seemed to work only because DeWynter said it did.  Hopefully, the film industry is getting a clue and slowing down on  producing films based on TV shows..."
4383,767015525,4,"There are several people who are critical of ""The Avengers"" and how differently it is from the series. I myself have never seen an episode from the series and can't say if it lives up to the original. The movie  itself was good. It was more enticing to those who have never seen original  episodes then to those that have, because those that have were expectant of  the exact same style. Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Mrs. Peel (Uma Thurman)  work well together. There's a certain chemistry there. Steed seems somewhat  cold, however. He never seems to connect with anybody on an emotional  level. (The same could be said of Mrs. Peel, however, but we see her go a  little crazy at interrigation. Come to think of it, they do seem to know  eachother farely well. They tell eachother about themselves through the  entire movie.) Connery was exellent as Sir August de Winter. The action  seens were good as well, flying mechanical bees and exploding buildings and  balloons. The biggest downfall of the movie, besides not following the path  of the series, would be the confusion it generates. How does the clone of  Mrs. Peel survive the fall? How does Mrs. Peel survive the fall off the hot  weather balloon? How does Steed grab hold of the steel railing after he  falls? Other then unrealistic jumps and stunts, the movie had humor,  action, and class. The only issue that I have trouble swallowing was the  single kiss between them, which Steed throws off as ""scientific  inquiry"". It was a nice kiss, but unnessicary. However, if this is how  Mulder and Scully are portrayed 20 years from now, I will personally go  down to the studio and shove a microphone through the director's forehead."
4384,767015525,1,"The less-demanding critic may hail it as being sharply witty, but an apology is due to those viewers smacking of intelligence.  Somebody should have warned Sean Connery away from such a horribly bad role.  This movie  was quick to hit rock-bottom, then surprised us all when it started to dig."
4385,767018699,4,Too bad the Avengers series are no longer being made. Netflix use to stream it but no more. If Amazon could snag the series I might reconsider Prime. I use to watch this as a little girl and it brought back a lot of fond memories
4386,767018699,5,"I Love this series!  It reminds me of my time in England while serving in the military.  Tara King and John Steed once again fight evil with their wonderful flair of bravery, cunning and class!  See this series of Avengers for great fun and pleasure!"
4387,767018699,4,"Like the Avengers and Mrs. Peel....
English humor,,, price reasonable ....
still interesting stories and colorful characters
price is affordable and play well"
4388,767018699,4,"Representing the Early Black and White Episodes, you cant go wrong for vintage sexy retro British Spy T.V.!  ""Mrs. Peel"" and John Steed are ever the sleek, elegant crime fighters from a different age.  And theres always champagne at the end...Cheers!"
4389,767018699,5,"The Avengers was a classic television series. It had intelligence, wit, great characters, good plots - if sometimes they did stretch credibility -  and the incredible chemistry between Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg. The shows here are not, in my opinion, the best of the series but even the second best are top grade. Rigg is as beautiful and charming as I remembered her and no actor has portrayed an English gentleman better than Macnee."
4390,767018699,5,"My beloved Mother (just turned 91) adored this series back in the day, she's thrilled and I'm so grateful for this wonderful item, all desires met!"
4391,767018699,5,"This was a great find.  Hard to find Avengers series.  If you like Spy, SciFi, Comedy, Action, Adventure all wrapped in one this series is for you.  I had the Avengers series on VHS especially Diana Rigg (Emma Peel) years.  Unfortunately over time VHS don't play as well.  Although these series are not in HD they play pretty good on the big screen.  This was a decent price as these are now out of print.  They arrived in great condition and play excellent on my blu ray.  I am very impressed.  Dianna Rigg years are the best where she played Emma Peel."
4392,767018699,5,"This set is a great way to be introduced to the Avengers. It contains some of the most outrageous episodes in the series. First up Never Say Die with Christopher Lee. This episode was very typical of the series and shows off how quirky it was. Epic is over the top and a little to much. But that was the intent by having it take place on a movie studio set, a first for a tv series I believe. The Superlative Seven is a quick fun episode done like Then There Were None type story. Donald Sutherland and Charlotte Rampling show up in this episode and due very well.
The Avengers was a show that broke all of the boudaries and really could not be pigeon holed. Great show!"
4393,767018699,5,It was like a homecoming to see Steed and Mrs. Peel again.  I had forgotten how good they were together. I grew up with these two and realize they had a pretty big impact on who I am today.
4394,767018699,5,Thank's for the outstanding job in keeping and sending this video in perfect shape . I will enjoy it for manny years to come. ART
4395,767001311,5,"There's no bigger fan of The Bob Newhart Show than me. Well, with the possible exception of my wife.

We just watched episodes from Season Two this morning, in fact, at which time we said, ""It's really a shame the rest of the serious isn't available on DVD.""

So I looked this morning and discovered - lo and behold! - that the complete series will be released in May.

IT'S ABOUT TIME!

And...

THANK YOU, NAMELESS TV EXECS!

Who cares if we already own Seasons 1-4? Honestly, what difference does it make? if getting the rest of these brilliant TV series on DVD means I have to re-buy Seasons 1-4 I'm more than happy to do so.

Quite complaining, people! For Pete's sake! Just be thankful that somebody in one of these networks had the brains to do what we've all wanted done for so many years.

""Hi, Bob.""

""Hi, Howard.""

""Hi, Emily.""

Bring it on!"
4396,767001311,3,I'm waiting for Seasons 5 and 6 to be released individually since I already own Seasons 1-4. I figure they just released Newhart Season 2 and is scheduling Season 3 to be released in April so I can keep busy watching those. I originally gave this 1 star but the content is 5 star but the way its being sold is 1 star so it balances to a 3 star.
4397,767001311,5,Now I have a chance to my kid see it. He goes to group therapy and loves how real it is. After some 40 years!
4398,767001311,5,Please don't blame or punish Shout! Factory because Fox spit in our collective faces.  Fox is in the wrong for taking $$ for four seasons knowing they would not produce 5 and 6.  Shout is doing us all a favor and I will gladly pay for the complete set as I know for a fact there are over $120 worth of laughs in seasons 5 and 6. Real comedy is priceless. They just don't make good T.V. like this anymore.  Just my 2 cents.
4399,767001311,4,"It was a good show.  I did, however think I had ordered the Newhart Christmas...but this program was okay too.
Enjoyed it."
4400,767001311,1,"I love the series but already own first 4 seasons and have been waiting YEARS for rest of series.  Now they only offer as full set.  I will not be buying the full set to get only the last two seasons.  I hope no one buys it so that the company gets the message that this is an unfair practice.  Makes me not want to order any more season sets of any show because they release a few to get us hooked then expect us to buy the whole series.  Kind of the same thing with Diagnosis Murder.  I guess it's bad form now to buy individual seasons and better to just wait until series has run it's course and wait for a ""whole series"" release.  I'm tired of getting burned by buying early seasons only to be duped in the end when the final season are not individually released.  We need to send a message to the people making these DVD sets."
4401,767001311,1,The Bob Newhart Show is one of the best shows of the 1970's era... great comedic timing and timeless jokes/lines. I was delighted to see that shout factory picked up bob newhart after all these years of waiting...but then my heart sank when I saw it was a box set. Its mary tyler moore all over again. For those of us who already own the first 4 seasons this is unfair. If we band together like we did for the mary tyler moore box set shout factory may break up the bob newhart set for all the customers who already own this wonderful tv series up to this point. GREAT show!
4402,767001311,5,This is a very good and very funny tv show. Unfortunatelly  I haven't seen a lot of the episodes for several years so I snatched this up. Ill  be  watching a lot of  theese  when  it arrives. One of my favorite episodes was when Bob Howard and Jerry got drunk on Thanksgiving and tried to order Chinese food. Between those three and Emily Carol and Bobs patients it was a very funny show which is finally getting released in its entirety. You should get it.
4403,767001311,4,"I ordered and waited patiently for the last two seasons of Bob Newhart only to be finally informed that it wouldn't be released. I already have seasons 1-4, so although I'm pleased that the Series is now available to buy in full, I'd be happier if I could buy seasons 5 and 6 separately. Will this happen in future, I hope so."
4404,767001311,5,"I took heat from someone oin  Amazon. COM for statements I made about an upcoming release from this series. Now, finally comes a proper release from Shout Factory. I will be buying this set for my collection."
4405,767015525,1,"Ho-hum!!! What good can be said about this movie except that it takes the mantle of ""Most Wretched Action Movie"" away from ""Batman Forever"". No chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman, both are great  actors, but horribly miscast. Even poor Mr. Connery looks weary of it all.  Plotting is tepid --I dozed through the middle of it-- and the only good  part is Uma in that leather catsuit *mrrrrroooww!!!!*Look, save your money  and just buy any of the boxed sets of the original series. They rock! And  Ms. Rigg looks better in her catsuit anyway!!!"
4406,767015525,3,"This is a film to watch for the sheer audacity. It has the merit of being extremely unpredictable, and bizarre. Patrick MacNee makes an interesting cameo in one bit. Fiennes and Thurman look positively glum throughout,  thinking they'll make a lot of money and run. The set pieces and special  effects, however, are fine, especially Big Ben exploding(ha ha!). Sean  Connery makes an entertaining villain . . . although he can make almost any  film he does watchable, that guy is a REAL actor. But on the whole, if you  want to see a film featuring everything from baddies in teddy bear costumes  to mechanical wasps(that's right) to Uma Thurman in a cat suit(it looks  nice on her actually) and an equally daft and strange plot, then this film  is for you. Total mind candy, but at least it's enjoyable in its own way."
4407,767015525,3,"I watched the original series with MacNee and Rigg (and even caught Honor Blackman in it). It was cheeky, weird and campy. All these elements make the transition to the big screen version. What's missing is the soul of the  television series.
I'm not sure, though, that the original would play  well today without some updating. Like many things from the 60's, it was  something very much of its time. Look at the Connery Bond films...they  wouldn't be as accepted today as they were then.
The time frame within  gives us a context. Without the context, the material doesn't always work.  The original series for all of the well written episodes had episodes that  were poorly plotted messes. Like the Star Trek series of films, the past  seems to add an luster to these dramas that they don't always  deserve.
Still, the original series was always a cut above the average  American television programs. It was always witty and the cast, more often  than not, could pull off the show precisely because of their charm. This  along with the bizarre elements that would crop up in the scripts made The  Avengers always good fun. The film doesn't completely pull it off, but  there are moments that work as well as the original series.
Fiennes  brings his own intrepetation to Steed. To have expected him to play it like  MacNee is pretty unrealistic and it probably wouldn't have worked. The same  goes for Thurman. However, for me she's the weak link in the  cast.
Connery plays his part over the top. It works precisely because it  worked in the original series. Expectations can be daunting and this film  had too many expectations. Time will soften the blow..."
4408,767015525,1,"You know how some movies are so badly done that they're actually funny in their awfulness... well, this is NOT one of them - it's much worse than that - it's TRULY worthless. It has NO redeeming features. Don't buy it!  Don't rent it! Instead, spend your money on copies of the old Avenger  series starring Patrick McNee and Diana Rigg. You'll find genuine campy  humour, British style, and the wonderful, sexy interaction between Steed  and Peel that made the original show so inimitable. I'll take one of Rigg's  tantalizing smiles over a rear view of Thurman in a leather cat suit, any  day."
4409,767015525,1,"The original series was great.  However this movie didn't live up to the original.  I have told several people if they happened to be at a local dump and they spotted a copy of this movie still sealed in the original  wrapper just leave it there.  This movie isn't worth the effort it would  take to pick it up, unless you have a dog who loves to dig holes and bury  things. I apologize, this movie deserves a -5 stars."
4410,767015525,1,"Jeremiah Chechik completely ruined the remake of Diabolique although he had a cast to die for,Sharon Stone of the greatest actresses of our time and Kathy Bates who is a great Character actress...here he actually makes a  boring action film. All style and no substance even achieving a mediocre  performance from the always wonderful Sean Connery. All I Know is when you  see Directed by Jeremiah Chechik or Joel Schumacher...avoid it like the  plague. Joel Schumacher is supposedly attempting to remake a fabulous french  film called L'appartement. That's like having a child restore a painting by  Cezanne or Da Vinci....It would be an insult,like this whole film was. An  embarassment."
4411,767015525,4,"I liked the original Avengers and I liked this movie. The script was not a very good one, but the sexy-stilish-modern acting of Sean Connery and especially Uma Thurman was extraordinary. If you haven't seen the TV Series  you surely won't get the feeling that comes with this movie and some  ""for insider"" ones. Like the unvisible man which is ridiculus but  from an original episode. The picture is clear and sharp as well as the  bright colors from the cinema are displayed very well."
4412,767015525,1,"Don't bother wasting your money on this horribly-plotted, bad story film.  The actors are fine, but the story is not smooth.  It is very choppy in some parts that they don't make sense and there are unanswered questions in  the film!  Heck, I could have made a better story for the Avengers series."
4413,767015525,2,"This movie goes down as one of the biggest lost oppertunites in the history of film. Ralph Finnes and Uma Thurman and Sean Connery all camping it up, great style, british accents, cool special effects, what could go  wrong? Well... ever seen pictures of the hindenburg? The film gets an added  star just because there were some sequences that worked, but it's an awful  film. And I don't mean awful as in, a great awful movie like 'Batman and  Robin' or 'Jack Frost'. Avengers is deathly dull. I mean, they even made  Sean Connery boring!! What a waste."
4414,767001311,2,"I love this series,and all things Newhart, but what is with this Heavy handed price gouging? It's about time it's being released in its entirety,but Seriously 120 dollars!! It seems like they are trying to take attvantage of loyal fans who most work hard to afford these little luxuries. Instead of making it more affordable creating a bigger market,therefore selling more and Making a whole lot more money long term. Imagine that,making a crap load of cash AND not Raking hard working fans over the Coals!!"
4415,767001311,5,"Given Fox's repeated failure to release the final two seasons of this classic, Shout! Factory is doing a tremendous service for all Bob Newart Show fans - and based on the comment history on Amazon, there are many of us.  I'll be more than satisfied to finally have the complete ""Bob Newhart"", but it would be greater still if, as a bonus, they included ""The Last Newhart"" episode from ""Newhart"".  This would be consistent with Shout! Factory's past practices, so I've got my fingers crossed."
4416,767001311,5,"I completely trust in ShoutFactory! to provide a professional and complete release of each of the six seasons as they have done in the past with other shows.

I know that some people are disappointed in the complete set, but think about the seasons that FOX provided of this great series.

Each season disc from FOX is double-sided, providing awful audio, and sometimes poor video images. Imagine what these first four season sets will look like on single sided discs, restored, and professionally produced by ShoutFactory!

Thank you ShoutFactory! for answering the call of the consumer. I'll proudly spend my money with you!

**UPDATE 4/25/2014:
I received an advanced copy from Shout! Factory and I can tell you that each disc is single-sided and there is a significant improvement with the audio from the FOX seasons, as well as, a marked improvement with the video. Shout! Factory took extra care for this release.

For instance, several episodes from the FOX releases clipped the main title from the opening credits. Comparing the same episodes with the Shout! Factory release, the main titles are intact and all of the words are included. There are no episodes with muddled audio, either.

The Bonus Disc was out of this world. You get 50 minutes of the surviving cast talking about the show. It was recorded in December 2013, so Shout! Factory pulled out all of the stops to do this release justice. In addition, there are two more extras, including the unaired pilot episode with different characters.

In addition, there is an amazing book included that has an easy to read explanation as to how they show came about, stayed on the network, and left while it was still on top in the ratings.

Seasons 1 & 2 are in one DVD case. Seasons 3 & 4 are in a separate DVD case. Seasons 5 & 6 are in a separate DVD case. The bonus disc is also separate. All are contained, along with the book, in the big box.

Now, here is the not-so-good news regarding Season 5 Disc 1 - ""A Crime Most Foul"". It has a very noticeable sync problem. I contacted Shout! Factory to see if I was sent a defective disc and they replied that the master they had access to and used also had the sync problem. I'm not sure if Shout! Factory had access to the original broadcast master because the show was shot on film and I also don't believe CBS would have allowed it to air that way. Regardless, the master that Shout! Factory has access to is the problem, not your individual disc.

Other than that, sit back and enjoy The Bob Newhart Show the way it was intended to be enjoyed. Thank you Shout! Factory for honoring Bob Newhart with this release and for answering the many fans who have been waiting a long time for this day to come as well!"
4417,767001311,2,"They are clearly gouging by not offering the final 2 seasons separately. There is NO excuse not to. It's no secret people are hungry for the final 2 seasons, we have been waiting for 6-7 years and it's clearly documented. They are just taking advantage."
4418,767001311,5,I watched the Bob Newhart Show when I was younger so when I saw The Very Best of the Bob Newhart in this boxed set I just had to get it. I was well pleased with my purchase.
4419,767001311,1,"I have purchased 3 different VHS tapes of this show. Two were used and one was in MINT CONDITION , still in sealed shrink wrap.
All three tapes were defective, with the exact same problems - lots of sparkles, ocassional rolling, and  I was constantly having to adjust the tracking. I can only assume that this production of this particular tape was somehow flawed, for all 3 to have the same problems.
 Ginny"
4420,767001311,5,"I'm holding out hope that Amazon might release the two final seasons in download form which never came out in the DVD sets.  If they do, I'll pick them up for sure.  We'd sure like to complete our collection.  This may allow us an opportunity to do just that!  (Same with the final three seasons of Mary Tyler Moore.)"
4421,767001311,5,"The Bob Newhart Show remains my favorite show of all time.  It is witty, funny, and timeless.  This is a wonderful ensemble show, with great comedic acting from the stars down to the walk-on characters.  I have waited for years to see this show come out on DVD.  I can't understand why it still has not been released in that format."
4422,767001311,4,"Yes, it's great to have this much, but this show absolutely deserves a complete DVD release.  Surely with shows like the Jeffersons and Good times showing up on DVD, the time has come to get Bob, Emily et. al. on DVD."
4423,767020294,5,"We LOVE A&E's production of Jane Eyre the BEST, and we have seen four other Jane Eyre movies. A&E's Jane Eyre is so MOVING. You can FEEL the characters every emotion by their GREAT facial expressions and how they  speak to each other. The Beautiful music and everything about this  production is so WONDERFUL. This movie really Tugs at your Heart. It is  truly UNFORGETTABLE!!!!!"
4424,767020294,5,"Let me say first, that I have seen every movie made of the book.  The book enchanted me so much that I had to see them.  The first version with Orson Wells was wonderfully acted but sadly produced. It left many scenes out.  That is my second favorite. This is my favorite by far because it included  many of the scenes that have been forgotten by most of the movies.  It did  have many flaws, and if they would have stuck to the book it would have  been better, but I recommend it highly for anyone wanting a good veiwing."
4425,767015525,4,"The Avengers. The words alone conjure up specific images of a never never London. Ralph and Uma step silently into the shoes of McNee and Rigg and attempt to reignite to explosive series of the 60's. The movie is a visual  frenzy of good ideas. The acting is appropriately over the top as is the  script. It has been given an unfair press, not even being revued prior to  release in England. Anyway, I liked it. It is fun, its silly, its  exciting... and Sean Connery is in it. What more do you want ? Does it have  a script ? No. Was it well planned ? No. That's what makes it work. Its  chaotic and wild. I only have one complaint. There is not enough of the  original music in the movie, and none of the songs on the OST appear in it.  Now that I've made this revue, I'm going to buy my own copy and have a cup  of tea. One lump or two ?"
4426,767015525,1,"i love the avengers...of course i'm talking about the tv show.patrick macnee and diana rigg were always charming and sly,making the plot almost secondary,but always interesting.now on to the movie....mr.fiennes and  ms.thurman are neither charming or sly,and neither they nor the plot is  interesting. even sean connery,the BRILLIANT sean connery,who has given us  such memorable performances in such movies as:the rock,medicine man and,of  course,bond,james bond, this time just gives us a headache. the basic plot  is that sean,playng the villian,sir august dewinter(subtle) wants to  control the weather. the sad thing is even after you watch the movie,you're  not really sure why. there's also an ""emma peel"" twin on the  loose,and poor patrick macnee as the invisible guest. don't ask me to  explain it,really...it's just so...i can't even say contrived,that would  give the plot too much depth..it's more like a defrosting refridgerator  with the food left in. and is it just a coincedence that uma has been in  the two worst films of all time,(""batman & robin"" being the  king,and this coming a close second!),or is this a case of the odor in the  elevator every time she's in it. i don't know,but all i do know is,DON'T  WASTE TWO HOURS OF YOUR LIFE ON THIS!!!!not even connery could save this  one."
4427,767015525,4,"I thought it was a pretty good movie and certainly retains all the humor and flair of the old tv show.  However, I believe I would have preferred seeing Sean Connery as John Steed and the other guy (I can't even remember  his name) as the bad guy.  I think Uma Thurman is beautiful and a marvelous  actress, but she will never replace Dianna Rigg as the redoubtable Emma  Peel, at least not for me."
4428,767015525,4,"You need to understand the genre to be able to fully appreciate this one. If you're expecting a ""straight"" movie, you'll miss the point entirely. I can only suggest you check some Avengers (TV show) internet  sites and do some research."
4429,767015525,1,"Well as many have said so far I too was looking forward to this movie thus when I saw it I was shocked. With a cast of true performers I was really expecting a ""knock your socks""off movie!.The story must have been  dreamt up by a seven year old Teddy bears and all!!.My only unanswered  question is why did Sean Connery aggree to feature in this movie its the  mystery of the century......."
4430,767015525,2,"I thought the movie brought back a sense of 60's charm of the original avengers series.  (If you have never seen the series you will think this movie is the biggest flop ever.)  I think the director should have spent  less money on special effects (especially the flying bug scene ?)  Sometimes I think when making movies they think the namebrand actors like  Connery , Thurman and Fiennes will just satisfy the audience, well this  movie proves that wrong.  It is very entertaining to see Connery in  different roles rather than 007 and Fiennes in a different role than a SS  officer.  But, they still don't satisfy this movie watchers expectations.  Nice try but this movie won't be a cult classic like it could have been."
4431,767015525,1,"this is by far the worst movie of the decade,sean was so bad that i was embarresed.the acting,directing,story,and special effects were all very poor. I could not believe one scene when they were driving their car through  london and not a car was present on the scene.this film does not deserve to  be purchased by anyone."
4432,767015525,5,"In the bold tradition of The Avengers, this movie tends to wind it's way around and about several story lines and a dozen characters.  If you've ever seen an episode and liked it, you will LOVE this modern re-telling!  Not for movie critics or whiny  why-doesn't-every-little-thing-make-sense'ers. . .  Not stop action and  wit!"
4433,767018699,5,again I cant say enough about it is very action packed and it was a great way for back in the times
4434,767018699,5,Steed and Emma Peel.  Who could ask for more.  The elaborate and twisted plots as always are foiled by the debonaire Stted and always beatufil Emma Peel.  Wathced this as a child.  Enjoyed watching the episodes again.  A definate addition to my library.
4435,767018699,5,"Very good as usual, with a guest appearance by John Cleese. Lots of Steed's in one episode and Tara at 20 paces in another."
4436,767018699,4,"Set is in fairly good condition. It skips through two episodes on one disk. I will try to clean and fill the disc and
I expect it to work fine. It was said to play well and I do not consider that to be playing well."
4437,767018699,5,Mrs. Peel elevates all scenes she is in to the edge by not knowing what to expect from her role as a mystery solving investigator while working hand in hand with Steed. Excellent program writing which is what we have come to expect from the Brits.
4438,767018699,5,Loved the Avengers back in the 60s when I was overseas - this brings it all back. Mrs Peel certainly has aged well.
4439,767018699,5,I can't get enough of Steed and Mrs. Peel. This was a great purchase and I'm thrilled to add it to my growing collection of The Avengers.
4440,767018699,4,"I really enjoyed the first and third episodes.  The middle episode looked too corny right from the start, so I skipped it. A mixed bag, but consider it if you can get it at a decent price.  I don't know why Avengers DVDs are so expensive!"
4441,767018699,5,"The Avengers is a great TV show. Has to rate in top 5 of all time. My personal favorite is The Fugutive. You can't go wrong with any of the Emma Peel era. The stories are intense and well written and acted. I am extremely dissapointed that netflix
removed the streaming episodes. Amazon , if you pick it up, I will switch to your service."
4442,767018699,5,very enjoyable dvd with some great episodes. Now if only we could get the colour episodes with Linda Thorson also.
4443,767018699,5,"I remember these as a child.  I loved them then, and I love them now.  Although they may seem a little campy now, the interaction of Emma Peele and Patrick McGee is as delightful as ever."
4444,767018699,5,"I have watched The Avengers since it ran in the 60s.  I've also recorded as many Avengers episodes from A&E and other sites on VHS as I can.  This disc set is great!  Even though I have watched this series for years, there were at least 2-3 episodes I don't remember ever seeing PLUS the rest of the disc set are classics.  This set is a must buy for Emma Peel fans, her first year, and Avengers fans."
4445,767018699,5,"DVD's came quickly and were packaged well.  I am saving them for a Christmas present, but I am fairly certain that they will be perfect."
4446,767018699,5,"There is not much to say about the color series of The Avengers, with Emma Peal.  It is, quite simply, among the most entertaining and clever television ever produced anywhere.

Is it the scripts, or is Diana Rigg's caustic and dry delivery just brilliant -- or both?

Never mind, just sit back, enjoy the wonderful colors of the sets and outfits, and get ready to have fun.

BTW, the transfers are beautiful.  They did it right on this one."
4447,767018699,5,The product was as advertised.  Delivery was very quick.  The price was fair.  I'm totally happy with this transaction.
4448,767018699,5,Product exactly as advertised.  Fair price.  Quick delivery.  What's not to like.  I'll be back!
4449,767018699,5,"It would not be possible to be more pleased than I am.  The product appears to be brand new even though it was sold as ""used"".  Delivery was fast, the price fair.  There's nothing to add except that I have already placed another order with this same supplier which should speak volumes.  As a certain actor once said:  ""I'll be back!"""
4450,767018699,5,This show should never have gone out of reruns. The DVD arrived on time and in good condition.
4451,767018699,5,"I knew what I wanted before I bought this DVD. I wanted to own it b/c I used to rent it from our local library. It came in superb condition. And I am GLAD that folks such as the ones selling on Amazon are here for others to enjoy these products.
THANK YOU!!!
A Very satisfied customer!!!"
4452,767020294,5,A number of actors have played the part but I like these 2 actors best of all.
4453,767020294,5,Arrived in timely fashion. New DVD.
4454,767020294,5,odd that the quality of the picture isn't better..i think the old vhs picture is better and i've had that forever...but i love the movie
4455,767020294,5,Really enjoyed movie
4456,767020294,5,A very enjoyable movie. I have watched this movie on public access TV and when I discovered it on DVD I went ahead and got it again and watched it. Now that it is in my library of DVDs. I can pull it down and watch it any time I want to.
4457,767020294,5,One of the best versions of Jane Eyre .... Ciarn Hinds is wonderful as Rochester and Samantha Morton is a perfect Jane.
4458,767020294,5,Another great Film...
4459,767020294,2,What chemistry??! There was none! Especially when compared to other versions. Sorry. I loved you from first moment I met you? And you showed this ' love' by shouting and insulting her? Why did they leave out the majority of the story?
4460,767020294,5,This is my favorite version of Jane Eyre.
4461,767020294,5,The absolute best performance of a classic.
4462,767020294,5,Good story and excellent portrayal of the book
4463,767020294,5,"I liked this version. A period love story.
Quick to unfold. Good acting. British have flair"
4464,767020294,4,"Many passionate Jane Eyre fans hate this adaptation. I have read the book more than once and I rather liked this version-- it doesn't maybe glorify the story to the fans, but it does accurately represent what the book looks like to the rest of us. The fans get upset about inaccuracies, but these are all just details. The essence of the Jane Eyre story is captured in this movie. An unhappy single woman falls in love with a rude cranky older guy. Turns out the guy is married, but it works out. There is beautiful scenery involved and a big house. Some spooky scenes.
The production is lavish and the actors excellent. Ciaran Hinds may not be the dashing hunk Rochester of legend, but he is the older man of the book. Sometimes I wonder if the Jane fans are mixing Rochester up with Teen Wolf.  And Samantha Morton makes an elegant, attractive Jane.
Recommended."
4465,767020294,5,I like it.
4466,767020294,5,good
4467,767020294,1,"The DVD had a small crack in it, and would not play."
4468,767020294,5,I have read this book before and it is interesting to see it in a movie form.
4469,767020294,3,actors not well matched; tone not like that of book
4470,767020294,3,"Imagine having your favorite book cast by two of your favorite actors for film. To me Hinds and Morton had exactly the right look for the characters. I've enjoyed the depth of their acting in other projects. They are both wonderfully talented. I anticipated this version with eagerness.

Alas reader,  the screenplay. What were they thinking? The spirit of the piece was way, way off in key scenes.  Jane is rolling her eyes at times and they both speak so abusively to each other for a lot of it. The first meeting was like that, very nasty to each other there.

But what really was off was Hines  yelling  all the time.  I heard his radio take on Rochester and his characterization was much calmer with more control. This Rochester is more bombastic than likeable. Seriously, I cant see what attracts Jane to him! These yelling torrents ruin key moments like that first meeting for example.  However, the stay with me scene (after the aborted wedding) was the worst. He was actually horribly bullying and abusive here. He throws things, he hurts her. He blames Jane for not excepting his view. He excuses himself with a ""What was I supposed to do, tell you the truth?"" kind of attitude. As she leaves he's calling out ""That's right leave, its just like you."" WHAT is he talking about?? Rochester is supposed to be heartbroken  NOT hateful. It was hard to watch such a total bolt away from the novel here!  And what's with all the open mouthed ""kissing"" when he proposes? (By the way, he yells here too!)

But there were scenes I really liked.  His confession of his past life to Jane is well staged and poignant. Watching the sunrise together was nice. When she just returns to Thornfield from visiting the aunt (that we never get to see-one moment she leaves the next she returns). The scenery and sets are all very pleasing. I especially loved the camera work during the party scene where Jane is remembering Blanche and Rochester singing. Bertha was a hoot. Shopping at Milcott was good, except for the insertion of Blanche there, Rochester is actually nice to Adel at times. Also, the ending, though the dialog is not exactly from the book, was extremely touching. They are both excellent in this scene. And a postscript scene with children and voice over was a nice touch. These are excellent actors. It would, I feel, been first rate to have these truly talented people in a better adaptation."
4471,767020294,5,Love this particular version
4472,767018699,5,"This is a very enjoyable  old TV classic.  So my review will only deal with the video quality.  And that is a very well done re-master of the old film.  The quality does not match current DVD offerings, but I was impressed how well they restored the old videos; I don't know how they could have done better.  Therefore I am giving this a rating of 5."
4473,767018699,5,"Prior to 1967, ""The Avengers"" was yielded in black-and-white. Going to color was a definite improvement; however in 1968 there were three additional significant changes:

1. Mrs. Peel (Diana Rigg) was traded out for Steed's new partner, Tara King (Linda Thorson).

2. The producers asserted that the 1968 episodes were more [paraphrasing] ""believable"" -- in fact, just the opposite is true. The '68 episodes are more bizarre than ever, but still very good.

3. There is more involvement by Steed's boss, ""Mother"" (a wheelchair-bound chubby guy who shows up in very strange places to discuss Steed's progress on respective cases).

This DVD package, (2 DVDs, individually cased and further packaged in an attractive cardboard box, this ""Set No. 2"" color-coded ORANGE), is the second of FIVE sets for the 1968 episodes. The marketing of ""The Avengers"" can be quite confusing so I wanted to get that information out up front. This is also the BEST way to buy the DVDs (by the ""set"" rather than by the ""volume"") for any season, from 1963 through 1968.

Patrick Macnee shrewdly plays John Steed, England's gentleman undercover agent. Linda Thorson is one of several of a line of Steed's voluptuous sidekicks. In the U.S., most of us didn't even know about Honor Blackman and Macnee's other (earlier) partners until years later when these episodes finally emerged on VHS tape. Diana Rigg can probably claim about 60% of the credit for the vast number of U.S. audience members who were glued to their TVs when ""The Avengers"" finally hit here. The other 40% (not forgetting Macnee's fine performances) had to do with the presentation of this excellent series.

Starting in 1965, with Rigg, the filmscore was notably updated and played more prominently throughout the story, enhancing the action and suspense. Also, the action itself was boosted. There was never a dull moment with Steed and Mrs. Peel. And these episodes were all FUN -- one embraced a sense that Macnee and Rigg were having a great time in making these films. Now that I've seen episodes from ""The Avengers'"" earlier years, ('63 and '64), I can see that they dragged quite a bit during that earlier era and were much more soap opera-ish. The fun continued throughout the final year, 1968, even though Linda Thorson was simply never quite as dynamic or as sexy as Diana Rigg. The '68 filmscore and title scenes at the beginning and the conclusion of each episode were spiffed up a bit too.

Each of these 52-minute episodes is futuristic (at least for the period) and on the cutting edge of excellent television productions. I know of no series, ""The Original Star Trek Series"" excepted, which has remained as timeless as ""The Avengers"". You'll encounter, in the 1968 episodes, every nemesis ranging from Eastern spies posing as murderous British Army officers to equally murderous hotel desk clerks.

In the 1968 Set No. 2 (which includes Vols. 3 and 4), we're talking about six very enjoyable, action-packed, color episodes:

Volume 3:

""All Done With Mirrors"" - Steed is under house arrest (a theme we've seen before!) while Tara plugs the leaks at a classified facility that hasn't been keeping its secrets.

""Legacy of Death"" - The inheritance of a dagger turns into a truly double-edged gift and bodies pile up in Steed's drawing room.

""Noon Doomsday"" - Steed is trapped in a convalescent home by an old adversary who has a flair for drama and a thirst for vengeance.

Volume 4:

""Look (Stop Me If You've Heard this One)... But There Were These Two Fellers"" - John Cleese guest stars as Steed and Tara face down a band of killer clowns determined to save their rest home from destruction.

""Have Guns... Will Haggle"" - Tara's on the hot seat when Black Market rifle brokers choose her for a product demonstration!

""They Keep Killing Steed"" - A plot to infiltrate and subvert a peace conference hinges on the creation of an exact double of Steed (yet another familiar theme!)

The storylines of the various ""The Avengers"" episodes seem absurd to varying degrees as we view them today - but 1968 continued to escalate the absurdity beyond the previous years' entries. This did not diminish my enthusiasm for the ""The Avengers"" because the overall series always manifested a ""Batman"" (TV series) tongue-and-cheekness about it. I mention this only to prepare viewers for this actuality.

The casting in all episodes is spot-on, punctuated with the very best sets and scenic locations. And Linda Thorson's astounding beauty (tenoned with her great figure!) really accentuates the `60s look in her mod attire.

I'll be reviewing all of the 1968 sets, (as I mentioned earlier, there are five in all, with 2 ""volumes"" per set), so be on the watch for my comments regarding the other sets at their appropriate sites on Amazon. In the meantime, while not exactly as marvelous as the 1967 episodes, this particular set still garners my highest recommendation!"
4474,767018699,3,"A lot of reviews of this set were great, especially the episode that related to picture (Queen of Sin). I've been an Avengers fan since its original airings, & I've always found Miss Peel right attractive, but Queen of Sin is the worst episode I've looked at on DVD so far. Her outfit is not really that sexy, & the story to that episode was absolutely lousy (& loud). If you're buying individual sets & not the whole Emma Peel megaset, then skip this set; don't let the cover fool you. The rest of the episodes in this set are better however, so if you're making complete year purchases, then buy this set too....you decide."
4475,767018699,5,"This is a superb old British TV series but buy the TWO volume SET for a better deal:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avengers-67-Set-2-Vols-3-4/dp/0767015533/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avengers '67 - Set 2, Vols. 3 & 4</a>

There, You can check out my full review of each episode as well as my other more general (but detailed) comments about the series.

Also, be aware that when you buy the TWO volume set, it comes with an additional cardboard (very nice) packaging case to hold together the two plastic DVD cases in one unit. This cardboard packaging has all the details of both DVDs on the outside."
4476,767018699,5,"Prior to 1967, ""The Avengers"" was yielded in black-and-white. Going to color was a definite improvement!

This DVD package (2 DVDs, individually cased and further packaged in a box, this ""Set No 2"" color-coded ORANGE) is ONE of FOUR sets for the 1967 episodes. The marketing of ""The Avengers"" can be quite confusing so I wanted to get that information out up front. This is also the BEST way to buy the DVDs (by the ""set"") for any season, from 1963 through 1968.

1967 was Diana Rigg's last full season as Steed's partner. Her career really launched in 1965 from this fine series in her role as Mrs. Emma Peel, the sexy and lively partner to the refined secret agent Englishman, John Steed, who was shrewdly played by Patrick Macnee. In fact, in the U.S., most of us didn't even know about Honor Blackman and Macnee's other (earlier) partners until many years later.

Diana Rigg can probably claim about 60% of the credit for the vast number of U.S. audience members who were glued to their TVs when ""The Avengers"" finally hit here. The other 40% (not forgetting Macnee's fine performances) had to do with the presentation of the series. Starting in 1965, with Rigg, the filmscore was notably updated and played more prominently throughout the story, enhancing the action and suspense. Also, the action itself was boosted. Never a dull moment with Steed and Mrs. Peel. And these episodes were all FUN -- one embraced a sense that Macnee and Rigg were having a great time in making these films. Now that I've seen episodes from ""The Avengers'"" earlier years, ('63 and '64), I can see that they dragged quite a bit during that earlier era and were much more soap opera-ish.

Each 52-minute episode is futuristic and on the cutting edge of excellent television productions. I know of no series, ""The Original Star Trek Series"" excepted, which has remained as timeless as ""The Avengers"". You'll encounter, in these episodes, every nemesis ranging from an airborne costume party to a man (actually, an androidish double of a man), who cannot be killed by traditional means.

Here, we're talking about six very enjoyable, action-packed, color episodes:

""The Living Dead"" -- A group of men are lost in a disastrous mine collapse, including the local squire. Afterward, a local hermit spots ""the ghost"" of this man, the ""dead"" Duke of Benedict, (as opposed to his wimpy succeeder), near a spooky cemetery chapel. Steed and Mrs. Peel investigate and they discover an ""underground city"" where an army of pseudo-evil-German-types is being built up to take over Great Britain! A superior episode.

""The Hidden Tiger"" - A butler is ripped to shreds in an English manor house. Nearby is an agricultural research station which falls under the suspicion of Steed and Mrs. Peel. After more maulings (deaths), it becomes clear that a devious Sussex organization, P.U.R.R.R., (!!!) is linked to the killings - all the victims seem to be on the organization's board of directors.

""The Correct Way to Kill"" - Russian espionage agents are being killed off in England... but not by the English agents. Steed and Mrs. Peel pair off with their Russian counterparts to catch the murderer. This episode is a lot of fun.

""Never, Never Say Die"" - A man is accidentally run down by a car and killed... but then he ""escapes"" off the exam table when the doc isn't watching! Steed and Mrs. Peel really get suspicious when he is killed a second time, by the same means, and later shows up causing a LOT of trouble. This macho guy also seems much affected by radio waves which leads The Avengers to discover that the man is an android and that more such android ""doubles"" of important people are infesting the local community. The bonus of this episode is that it stars the great Christopher Lee!

""Epic"" -- Mrs. Peel is kidnapped and taken to Schneer Studios where she is forced to make a movie about her own murder; however, the killers are mostly incompetent. This is a funny one.

""The Superlative Seven"" - Steed attends a high-end costume party that is conducted in an aircraft bound for... ??????  It's quickly discovered that all the invited guests are athletes of sorts and that they will be utilized to test a new and improved superman. Mrs. Peel flies to the dangerous and isolated island stronghold to attempt Steed's rescue. A very fun romp of an episode.

The storylines of the various ""The Avengers"" episodes seem absurd to varying degrees as we view them today - but 1967 marked an even higher level of absurdity... in fact, it actually went ""sci-fi"" in some episodes. This did not diminish my love for the ""The Avengers"" because the overall series always manifested a ""Batman"" (TV series) tongue-and-cheekness about it. I mention it only to prepare viewers for these changes and actualities.

The casting in all episodes is spot-on, punctuated with the very best sets and scenic locations. And Rigg's provocative, '60s mod body suits much accentuate her sensual magnetism with the notable change from black-and-white to color.

I'll be reviewing all of the 1967 ""sets,"" (as I mentioned earlier, there are four in all, with 2 ""volumes"" per set), over the next few days so be on the watch for my comments regarding the other sets at their appropriate sites on Amazon. In the meantime, this particular set garners my highest recommendation!"
4477,767018699,5,"James Bond, move over! This is a set of SEVEN, 52-minute entries from the great and brilliant team of Patrick Macnee (as the aristocratic John Steed) and Diana Rigg (as the tantalizing Emma Peel). The Rigg years were definitely the best ones and there is one other set from 1966 (also with Rigg, it offers SIX episodes) so don't confuse them! All these episodes were shot in black-and-white and the aspect is full-screen. Here's a rundown of the episodes:

""The Danger Makers"" --  The '60s version of the TV show ""Jackass""! Steed and Peel have to ascertain why these important British officials continue to challenge suicide -- and some succeed! Written by Roger Marshall.

""A Touch of Brimstone"" -- This one was banned from American television because Emma Peel dons high-laced boots, a spiked dog collar and a very skimpy outfit! Here, we have The Hellfire Club, hoaxsters, and murder! Written by Brian Clemens.

""A Sense of History"" -- It's a battle over economic theory, by medieval Robin Hood types. But these denizens of the woods (and a college campus) don't mind killing those who disagree with their views. This is a superb episode. Written by Martin Woodhouse.

""How to Succeed... at Murder"" -- Business executives are being knocked off... by their feminist secretaries?!? The trail leads Steed and Mrs. Peel to an elite perfumery but the ring leader is quite elusive. Written by Brian Clemens.

""Honey for the Prince"" -- A Middle-eastern prince on a diplomatic mission is the target for assassination. Steed and Mrs. Peel intervene. Diana Rigg was never HOTTER than she was in this special ""Bonus Episode"". Written by Brian Clemens.

""What the Butler Saw"" -- The secret defense plans are stolen! Steed must take on the disguise of a student butler to resolve the mystery. Written by Brian Clemens.

""The House That Jack Built"" -- Here, we have a psychological thriller. Mrs. Peel inherits an estate from her ""Uncle Jack,"" and is subsequently  trapped inside a carnivalistic madhouse. Steed rushes to the rescue. This is a great one. Written by Brian Clemens.

I don't know if you get the same deal if you purchase the DVD set -- with the VHS set, you'll get 3 tapes, with two episodes per tape (except on one tape where there's the ""bonus episode,"" which makes three episodes on that one), for a total of 7 episodes. The tapes are not copy-protected.

There were Avengers episodes prior to 1965 but they weren't quite as good -- they were more soap opera-ish. Macnee had two or three different lady-partners during those earlier years and those gals simply weren't as dynamic as Rigg. Also, the music, action, and story-writing much improved in '65, which is when ""The Avengers"" got launched on to American television -- I watched every one of these episodes at the time. These black-and-white Macnee-Rigg entries continued through 1966, (it went color after that and Rigg eventually left the series). In the end, '65 and '66 were the two best years of all."
4478,767018699,5,"This is the second half of the 1965 series -- if you're looking for the first half of the '65 entries, go here:

Diana Rigg's career really launched in 1965 from this fine series and in her role as Mrs. Emma Peel, the sexy and lively partner to the refined secret agent Englishman, John Steed, shrewdly played by Patrick Macnee. In fact, in the U.S., most of us didn't even know about Honor Blackman and Macnee's other (earlier) partners until many years later.

Each episode is futuristic and on the cutting edge of excellent television productions. I know of no series, ""The Original Star Trek Series"" excepted, which has remained as timeless as ""The Avengers"". In this set, you'll encounter everything from giant man-eating plants to artificial rain that drowns nosey people.

Here, we have SEVEN great episodes (one more than Set One): ""The Hour That Never Was"" (written by Roger Marshall); ""Dial A Deadly Number"" (written by Roger Marshall); ""The Murder Market"" (written by Tony Williamson); ""A Surfeit of H2O"" (written by Colin Finbow); ""Man-Eater of Surrey Green"" (written by Phillip Levene); ""Two's A Crowd"" (written by Phillip Levene), and; [bonus episode] ""Too Many Christmas Trees"" (written by Tony Williamson).

It's difficult to evaluate which is the ""best"" episode in this set -- they're all quite excellent. I WILL say that this set of episodes is just marginally better than the first set. The '65 series makes for great all-day TV watching on a rainy Saturday -- in fact, I watch them over and over. The entire series is sort of crazy like ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E."" but with the great British ambiance of ""Doctor Who"". If you've never seen ""The Avengers"" before, you're in for a real treat!"
4479,767018699,4,"I bought this DVD because of the extremely silly episode with the long title. I remembered watching it in 1968, and being amazed at all the talent on show, and always had it as a favourite. It wears as well as you expect, which means I love the stagey sets, outrageous clothes (yes, we wore stuff like that), the cars. I'm a hard-core Emma Peel fan, but Tara, while not being quite so forceful nor as sexy, has her own appeal. The other episodes are like new to me - maybe I didn't see them back then, but I was such a regular every Saturday evening ... memory fades."
4480,767018699,5,"A great series.  Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) was and still is the sexiest of the female martial arts heroes before or since.  Patrick McNee was in real life not too dissimilar from character John Steed but he never matched his work in this series.  Low key, tongue-in-cheek funny, pretty non-violent, and still remembered and revered today, it should be a model for TV and movies today in lieu of the pseudo-scientific, over-the-top special effects stuff we get instead."
4481,767018699,5,This was a last minute Christmas present for an Emma Peel/Avengers fan & she LOVED IT! Exceptional video quality allows us to relive the wittiest (& best) Avengers duo once again- I wasn't named after 'Emma Peel' but secretly wished I had been- she was the epitome of the smart & sexy woman! This great collection will have you ordering more of the series!
4482,767020294,5,Truly wonderful. Ciaran Hinds is fantastic as Mr. Rochester. My heart was practically beating out of my chest the whole movie!
4483,767020294,5,"Both Ciarn Hinds and Samantha Morton are stunning and intense in this adaptation of Jane Eyre.  Although it is only a TV movie (not a mini-series as such novels deserve) it is one of the better versions, though I have yet to find one that I distinctly do not like (the older ones, excepting the one I originally saw by Orson Welles are all somewhat DATED in their acting, sets, cinematography and choice of emphasis).  The narration of the story by Samantha Morton, as Jane, gives greater insight into the repressed but passionate nature of the literary character.

Among the adaptations I rank this as my 3rd favorite (the most recent with Fassbender is 1st and the BBC miniseries with Toby Stephens is 2nd)"
4484,767020294,5,"I love most all Jane Eyre movies, this one is GREAT !!!!"
4485,767020294,5,This version of Jane Eyre is one of the best I have ever seen. The videography is beautiful and the acting is superb. A great video for any Bronte enthusiast.
4486,767020294,4,"So far, My Favorite Production of a well-told Story."
4487,767020294,5,MY FAVORITE EDITION OF JANE EYRE.  I LOVE CIARAN HINDS.  ALL THE ACTORS ARE WONDERFUL.  VERY WELL DONE.
4488,767020294,5,"Excellent version of Jane Eyre.  There is obviously some gaps, due to time constraints, but the movie is well done.  Cieran Hinds is brilliant!"
4489,767020294,5,the best of all 10 Jane Eyre ever made
4490,767020294,5,love this movie
4491,767020294,5,This is my favorite of all the Jane Eyre movies! The cast is so authentic and believable. More aligned with the book than the others! Ciaran Himes and Samantha Morton are definitely Edward and Jane! Love this movie and wished that there were a part two with these two actors in it.
4492,767018699,5,"This is just a complete nostalgia trip.  I remember being entranced by the ""derring do"" of the Avengers as a kid, and being captivated by Diana Rigg in the re-runs as a teenager.  The series has aged very well and Mrs. Peel still captivates.  In my opinion, (without splurging on the Megaset), this is the best compromise set for ""Emma-watching"", and has most of the episodes you will want or that you need as a fan of the divine Ms. Rigg.  Given the age of the source material, the video and sound quality are very good and the packaging is standard fare."
4493,767018699,2,"These are some of the best shows I've seen. I'm a big ""Avengers"" fan and have episodes back to the Honor Blackman days. No doubt that Mrs. Peel and Steed were the best duo to tdo the show. I recommend their episodes to anybody."
4494,767018699,5,"Each of Steed's ladies made their own mark.  Honor Blackman's Kathy Gale, set the pace.  Sleek sassy women, who were as smart as they were sexy.  They held their own in a man's world and didn't need someone to take care of them.  Blackman and Rigg were two very positive role models in a time when most women were victims, wives or secretaries on telly at the time.  Blackman made less of an impact in US, because they were generally shown as a Summer Replacement, to keep people from seeing reruns.  Since they were run on ABC, tried to be recognized as a big-boy network the old Black and White Gales were not widely scene.

Rigg came along and made Emma Peel a character that will go down in the hall of fame.  She is as popular today, if not more so.  So when she left--to do as Blackman did -- go on to be a Bond girl, Steed had to have another partner.  Enter Tara King.  She gorgeous full figure Canadian with eyes to do for.  They tried to play on her more feminine side (and with horrid fashions).  Seriously, the clothes designers for Tara needs shooting.  For the most part, they couldn't design more dumpy look clothes.  They stuffed her in a series of wigs - some very bad - so point one, she was fighting an uphill battle.  Also, the scripts were not as sharp.  Even so Tara is charming and a pleasure to watch.

Episodes include:

All Done with Mirrors

Legacy of Death

Noon Doomsday

Look (stop me if you've heard this one)... but There Were These Two Fellers

Have Guns... Will Haggle

They Keep Killing Steed (with a very blond Ian Ogilvy doing a guest spot)"
4495,767018699,5,"Second set of 1967 - again are the Avengers at their best.

1) ""The Living Dead"" - ""Steed finds a mine of information - and Emma goes underground"".  Steed and Emma find rumour of ghosts abound around an ancient chapel, leading the pair to underground plot to take over Britain

2)  ""The Hidden Tiger"" - ""Steed hunts a big cat - and Emma gets badly scratched"".  In this episode, Steed and Emma are looking to people being killed and all signs show they are being killed by a tiger stalking the British country side.  Look for Gabrielle Drake in this episode (the head purple wigged Moon base gal from UFO!).

3) ""The Correct Way to Kill""  ""Steed changes partners - and Emma joins the Enemy"" has more than one Steed dashing about, as John and Emma try to end a ring selling British top secrets.

4) ""Never, Never Say Die""  ""Steed meets a dead man - Emma fights the corpse""  A man determined to steal the patent on eternal life has Emma and Steed running in circles and seeing the dead.

5) ""EPIC"" - ""Steed catches a falling star - and Emma makes a movie"" has Emma unwittingly starring in a movie called ""The Destruction of Emma Peel"".  A premise John feels is not up to ""snuff"".

6) ""The Superlative Seven"" - ""Steed flies to nowhere and Emma does her party piece"" A really fun episode has the great Donald Sutherland as a mysterious host, ala Ten Little Indian.  All the guests are the best at what they do, invited by someone unknown to them.  Lured aboard a plane and set down on a tiny island, they must fight to save their lives.  Emma is determined to find Steed before it's too late.  Also, look for a young Charlotte Rampling in this send up of the Magnificent Seven.

All great episodes of the series at it's peak."
4496,767018699,5,"Seconds series 1966, still B & W has some really great episodes with Steed and Mrs. Peel.  The gelling of Rigg's and Macnee's characters were well onto making

screen history, and with cause.  Both of these fine actors brought these characters alive.  Seven episodes this time.

1) ""The Danger Makers"" sees a high-ranking ex-serviceman seeking to feed their high threshold for adventure.  The banter between Steel and Mrs. Peel sharpens to double entendres that trademarks their pairing.

2) ""A Touch of Brimstone"" lets Mrs. Peel take down her hair, or rather put it up, as Emma and John investigate a group resurrecting the infamous Hellfire Club.  Mrs. Peel shows she looks just as stunning in corset, high-lace boots and spiked dog-collar, which she wears as the ""Queen of Sin"".  The look was designed by Rigg, and ridiculously, because of her costume, the episode was banned from airing in the US!

3) ""What the Butler Saw"" has our pair of Britain's best out in search for missing defense plans.

4) ""The House that Jack Built"" has Emma receiving news her uncle has died and left her his country estate.  When she gets to the manor, she soon finds herself drugged and trapped inside a house that is far from your normal house, as designed to end Emma's life.

5) ""A Sense of History"" Have Emma donning a merry man's costume in this Robin Hood adventure.  A modern day Robin is found with an arrow in the back, pushing Steed and Emma to stop the neo-fascist Merry Men from achieving their devilish plans.

6) ""How to Succeed at Murder"" puts Emma and John on the trail of executives being executed, in a posh perfumerie where a woman ""nose"" best.

7) ""Honey for the Prince"" when a resort where you live out your fantasies turns deadly, our pair are sent to stop the evil doings.  Emma goes harem girl! to save the day and up the ratings!

Many were written by Brian Clements with a variety of directors such as James Hill, Don Leaver, Peter Graham Scott and Charles Crichton."
4497,767018699,5,"The Second set of 1965 era has Steed and Peel gelling as partners.  Rigg and Macnee have the perfect sizzle of chemistry.  Admiration in their eyes, the flash and fire, but all kept quite under control as they function together to stop the evil menace against Britain.  I have seen some say this series came about because of the success of the Bond Film, but it was already on the air with the
early episodes, and follow in the trek of Patrick MacGoohan's ""Danger Man"", which turned into ""Secret Agent"" (and then into ""the Prisoner"").  These seven episodes are still in B&W, which I think even added to this mysterious ambiance of the episodes.  Being able to film in lower light, permits those deep shadows, giving a sinister touch.

1) ""The Murder Market"" takes Steed and Emma undercover at a marriage bureau, ending with Steed rescuing Emma from being buried alive as she gets too close to the ""black widows"" at the center of this evil plot
2) ""A Surfeit of H20"" A freak rainstorm drowns locals in the fields.  Fearing this is the return of the ""Great Flood"", they villagers have begun building a new Ark.  Emma is stylish even in a Mac!
3) ""The Hour That Never Was"" Steed visits his old RAF airbase in Hamlin.
Hours are missing in people's memories, so Steed and Emma must uncover brainwashing saboteurs, threatening England.
4) ""Dial a Deadly Number"" have Steed and Emma investigating a device called a ""Bleeper"".  The Bleeper is designed to help millionaires keep in touch, but an evil doer has set it to reach out and kill.
5) ""Man-Eater of Surrey Green""  When a outer space artichoke, lands and takes root, and begins killing eminent horticulturists, Emma and Steed get out the Roundup.  Rocky and Bullwinkle fought a similar plant in the cartoons - wonder who was first...lol?
6) ""Two's A Crowd"" Russian agents had let loose a doppelganger for Steed, in order to infiltrate a defense conference
7) ""Too Many Christmas Trees"" is one of my fav episodes.  Steed has been having a strange nightmare, so he welcomes the invitation for Hols in the country at friends.  He invites Emma to tag along.  They dress up in period costumes, and all seem to have a good time, but Emma begins to suspect Steed's dream is not a dream, but someone trying to control Steed's mine through telepathy

Just great fun to have these on DVD."
4498,767018699,5,"I borrowed this set from a friend and couldn't get enough of it. A great collection of episodes, like the well written (and provocative) ""A Touch of Brimstone"" to the dead funny ""What the Butler Saw"" and the toying-with-your-mind ""The House that Jack Built"". This set provides a excellent, varied taste of the show. I recommend it to everyone, but if you really love the show, I say just buy the Emma Peel Megaset on DVD! (now that's what I want for Christmas!)"
4499,767018699,5,"I am still kind of angry that A&E releases TV shows in episode groups instead of season sets, making all the sets way too expensive, even knowing they are all bare bones with no extras at all! (They recently got it right with the upcoming THE NEW AVENGERS: COMPLETE FIRST SEASON)
 Well, this set is one of the best. Diana Rigg is not my favorite Avenger girl (Joanna Lumney as Purdey in THE NEW AVENGERS is) but she shows here why she became the most popular all around the world (Except for France, they like Tara King) and probally Steed's favorite.
 THE MURDER MARKET- An excellent dark but funny episode. The Hitchcockian direction is superb like the fantastic aquarium murder during the intro. Funny moments include Steed imitating a fish and Emma dancing around her coffin. However, there are a few cons: This was Diana's first episode, and the writers were trying to make her a Cathy Gale-type of character who argues with Steed. Don't get me wrong, I love the Cathy Gale episodes as well, but this isn't Emma! It's Cathy! The other con is the embarassing use of a male stunt to replace Diana Rigg during a fall.  (4/5)
 A SURFEIT OF H20- This episode's plot was taken to do the mediocre movie in 1998.  It deals with A DIABOLICAL MASTERMIND who creates a weather-making machine! Quite overrated. The villain is too nice and his diabolocal plan is rather weak. There is also the annoying Noah-like character that screams through the entire episode. There are still some good moments, like the slippery fight at the end. Let's not forget the way victims die: It makes no sense! (3.5/5)
 THE HOUR THAT NEVER WAS- This starts off as a Twilight Zone episode, with Steed and Emma inside a deserted airbase trying to figure out what is going on! It is soon explained, only at the end. This is a very fun episode. The first half, with nothing but dialogue between Rigg and McNee is very amusing. (4.5/5)
 DIAL A DEADLY NUMBER- Before the pager was invented, there was the bleeper! Businessmen are dying from heart-attacks and Steed tries to crack the case. They all were carrying a pager-like device inside their pockets. What could it be? If you love the Cathy Gale episodes like me, you are going to love this one. Very dark episode with excellent funny moments like the wine-tasting contest. Only con: The plot is quite confusing after a while. (4.5/5)
 THE MEN-EATER AT SURREY GREEN- This episode puzzles me. It is a very funny take at the many Sci-Fi and B-Horror flicks from the 50's. There are many hilarious moments here (Was that ""moon vegetation"" line intentional?) and the old lady always cracks me up. But there are some moments that are way too dark and sad for such an apisode such as the electrocution. Let's not forget the Laura sub-plot that is dropped out half-way through. If you excuse the horrible stuntwork during the climatic fight, (The stuntman from THE MURDER MARKET is back again!) you will have a fun time. But it is still a silly ""bad"" episode. (3/5)
 TWO'S A CROWD- This is a quite good episode. The doopledanger issue is done quite well here. The actio sequence at the end featuring model bombers is excellent. (4/5)
 BONUS: TOO MANY CHRISTMAS TREES- Simple: This is one of the best AVENGERS ever! You have a fair X-Files plot, good villains, excellent creepy Christmas atmosphere, some horror movie elements, silly dream sequences, hilarious dialogue, and the great relationship between Steed and Emma. The tag scene is not to be missed! (Did they kiss?) One thing however: What happened to the psychic villainess? Well, enjoy the show! (5/5)"

It this particular version a lot of events were dismissed and rewritten, but what you can expect from not-even-2-hour movie!? Also didn't like Mr. Rochester in the beginning, he was hateful, mean, arrogant, bad-mannered, not quite Charlotte Bronte's description and again -still handsome (in the book he wasn't handsome man). But with the movie's progress he becomes quit Bronte's Rochester.
I JUST LOVE the passion between Jane & Mr. Rochester!!! The both actors are brilliant!!! How they felt each other! Best chemitry on the screen. Also like to see Gemma Jones as Mrs. Fairfax - wonderful! (I'm her big fan).
Great movie, but if you never watched other versions and/or never read the book, do so, it'll explain a lot of gaps of this movie ( I HIGHLY recommend ""not-so-wide-known""1973 adaption. I've just discovered it myself and was blown away...)"

4511,767018699,5,"The concluding black-and-white episodes of the Diana Rigg series had a more than usual tendency to show off her figure to fullest advantage.  Such is the case especially with ""A Sense of History,"" in which she dresses in a leg-revealing Robin Hood outfit, and ""A Touch of Brimstone,"" where she wears next to nothing as the Queen of Sin (and is attacked with a whip, to boot).  ""How To Succeed...At Murder"" has her in a bodystocking/leotard, practicing ballet for a good portion of the story.  And when she isn't dressing down, she's quite the clothes-horse, wearing a gorgeous white pants suit, for instance, in ""The House That Jack Built,"" a memorably striking bit of surrealistic sci-fi.
Oh, yes  -  Patrick Macnee is here too, lest we forget that he was the only actor to have starred in every season of the show.  And he gets to play dress-up in these episodes, as much as Diana Rigg dresses down.
As usual, the interplay between the two is delightfully witty and sparkling, their interaction with numerous flamboyantly unusual villains (and more common thugs) well-choreographed and exciting."
4512,767018699,5,"""Castle De'ath"" is an unusual Avengers entry, in that Steed and Emma are both undercover at the same place at the same time, from the very start of the episode.  The cinematography is curiously rather bleached, for what probably should have been a starker melodrama  -  but it works splendidly, anyway.  This one consists mostly of skulking and good fights, Emma's skulking done in a fetching peignoir by moonlight.  The flirtation between Emma and Steed is especially light and playful.  The plot, about a secret submarine base and its connection to the disruption of the local economy, is clever and credibly handled.
""The Master Minds"" is one of my personal favorites, about a MENSA-esque high-I.Q. club called RANSACK, which utilizes the best minds in Britain  -  without their knowledge  -  to infiltrate and sabotage military bases, and steal state secrets for sale to the highest bidder.  It's quite similar to Ian Fleming's contemporaneous James Bond novel, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service""  -  which, amusingly enough, starred Diana Rigg in the film version.  Like ""Castle De'ath,"" Steed and Emma work undercover at the same location, but with a far different result:  Emma becomes brainwashed into RANSACK's nocturnal espionage society, and Steed has to snap her out of it  -  before she kills him.  The concluding fight is terrific, Emma's final punch-line one of the more humorous in the series by means of its unique delivery.
A very good pair of early Avengers episodes."
4513,767018699,5,"For my money, this set represents The Avengers at its peak. They did terrific shows before and after these last seven episodes of '66, but they never had another such sustained streak of brilliance as this here.
The set includes ""The House That Jack Built,"" my favorite episode of the Diana Rigg series. I love it because it's such a great showcase for Diana as an actress, but also that we can see a strong, intelligent female character saving her own skin (rather than being rescued by a dashing hero) by *reasoning* her way out of the problem. I also think the house itself is just an ingenious idea: what would you do if you were stuck in a house designed as a machine to trap you inside? Apparently the producers were so intrigued by the idea, they gave Mrs. Peel a similar problem in the '67 episode, ""The Joker.""
I also see the influence of the episode pop up in other series from time to time. Some writers have noted the debt that the X-Files owes to the Avengers. Look for the X-Files episode called ""How the Ghosts Stole Christmas"" (w/ Ed Asner & Lily Tomlin) playing on FX during the holidays, and see if you don't think it's Chris Carter's homage to ""The House That Jack Built.""
Anyway, every episode in this set is just as inspired and witty in its own way, most of them variations on secret societies and assassination conspiracies. We also get some of Diana Rigg's most notorious costumes here: the Queen of Sin in ""A Touch of Brimstone,"" a harem girl in ""Honey for the Prince,"" and Robin Hood in ""A Sense of History.""
My only complaint: where is the chessboard introduction to the episodes? I realize that the intro was created only for the American audience, but for Americans who saw the program on TV it's become part of the show! Every US fan who knows the show from TV can recite the narration from memory: ""Extraordinary crimes against the people and the state have to be avenged by agents extraordinary... two such people are John Steed, top professional, and his partner Emma Peel, talented amateur... otherwise known as... THE AVENGERS!""
Come on, you hear the burst of bongos, you see the guy fall onto the chessboard with a knife in his back, there's the narration, Emma steps forward in her catsuit, Steed breaks out the champagne... and you're primed to go. How could they take that out? It's classic! So classic, the definitive book on The Avengers, THE COMPLETE AVENGERS by Dave Rogers, has a cover photo of Steed & Mrs. Peel standing on the set. I just don't understand what A&E was thinking.
If you're new to the show, you won't miss what you never knew, and nobody should let that omission deter them from getting the set, anyway. It's just a small frustration for me because I like the intro so much. Apart from that, five stars for the set. The stories are as clever as the series ever got, Rigg has really found herself in the role by now and the chemistry between her and Patrick MacNee is electric, and the b&w film looks incredible after the restoration. If you're buying your first Avengers set, start here."
4514,767018699,5,"What a provocative cover! If you fondly remember that great British import that we watched on TV way back in the 60s then you no doubt know about the content of what you are getting. You are more likely concerned about the quality of the product. Like John might say to Emma, ""You scratch my back and I'll scratch your back. Just watch the hat please."" John and Emma are back and are here to stay. Being on DVD, the aesthetics about the actual episodes are not in question here. More appropriately one may ask how they look. They look good, very good, excellent in fact. Still can't get that great theme out of my head. You get seven on this one."

4517,767018699,5,"The Avengers '65 Sets 1 and 2 are a ""must have"" for any Avengers fan--especially fans, like me, who grew up in the 1960's while watching the series on ABC-TV. The '65 sets feature perhaps the most original, certainly  the most British, episodes in the '65 - '67 series. ""Too Many  Christmas Trees"" and ""A Surfeit of H2O"" are my personal  favorites."
4518,767018699,5,"If you've been thinking of getting one of the A&E DVD re-issues of the original 'Avengers', start with this one. The stand-out episode here is 'Honey For The Prince', which is imaginative, funny, and extremely  eccentric (a cricket match breaks out during one scene). There is also the  infamous 'Touch of Brimstone' -- notable for its bawdy content and Diana  Rigg's 'Queen of Sin' costume. Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg's chemistry as  a team was never stronger than in the episodes on this disc (and you get a  bonus seventh episode with this set, instead of the standard six)."
4519,767020294,5,Love this version of the movies.
4520,767020294,5,everything was great
4521,767020294,5,"This is my favorite film version of Jane Eyre, but can be hard to get. I suppose it is not all that popular because it was a made-for-TV movie. However, a great cast makes this film worth the search, especially Samantha Morton as Jane and Ciaran Hinds Mr. Rochester. The end is wonderful."
4522,767020294,1,This DVD would not play on my machine even though it's designed for Blu-Ray DVDs.  Additional the only subtitles were in Spanish.  I had to return it.
4523,767020294,5,"Charlotte Bronte is second only to Jane Austen as the best author ever.  this is an excellent classic and very well done.  However, even though Jane Eyre obviously had never been kissed prior to falling in love with Mr. Rochester, her director in this movie should have told her to fake it because the lack of experience in the kiss does not endear one to the scene.  And it was a very critical scene but I wanted to throw rocks at her.  The movie is excellent and well done....other than the kissing scene."
4524,767020294,5,Hands down - Samatha Mortion is the best Jane Eyre ever!
4525,767020294,5,nice
4526,767020294,3,Not my favorite Jane Eyre version...Mr. Rochester was a bit too rough for the character. Samantha Morton did superbly!
4527,767020294,5,"This is a great Jane Eyre. I actually have 3 favorites: 1983, this one, and 2011. They are each different and have qualities that I love. Ciaran Hinds definitely brings out the edgier, tempermental side, which like it or not, is the way Mr. Rochester is described in the book. I like that portrayal, but I also appreciate the more restrained rendition done by Michael Fassbender, as do I enjoy the cocky, domineering traits brought out by Timothy Dalton. They are all good, folks. No need to feel disloyal for liking more than one. However, stay away from the William Hurt version. He did not even come close to filling Mr. Rochesters shoes. It was a train wreck.
What I really like about this version is the sweet chemistry between Jane and Mr. Rochester. She finds him charming in spite of how flawed he is, and it really shows in her expressions. Ciaran Hinds' Mr. Rochester is abrupt and unpolished, and I rather liked his portrayal. His Mr. Rochester is gruff, passionate, volatile, and vulnerable. And Samantha Morton's Jane is spunky, sweet, and feminine, I think more so than other Jane Eyre's. Yet she still embodied Jane's quiet reserve and stifled passion.
I watched this movie when it came out back in 1997. All opinions are my own."
4528,767020294,4,I prefer the older movie of Jane Eyre.  I continue to look for the older movie that was filmed in the fourth.  If you have that movie  let me know so that I may order it
4529,767020294,2,"This movie is good, but entirely too rushed. It would have been a very good idea, in my opinion, it have at least put captions letting you know how many years passed between particular scenes. With it not being this way you miss much of the power of her story. However, no screen adaption is ever perfect, and given that decades of Jane's life are covered in an hour and a half (thus the benefit of captions) the movie adaption is about as faithful as you can do."
4530,767020294,5,Excellent movie
4531,767020294,5,I must say that I enjoyed this rendition
4532,767020294,5,"I usually don't like remakes of old movies, but this one is great.  The character of Jane is a strong woman.  Not in today's sense where ""strong"" women can be obnoxious and demanding or for that matter can beat any guy in the room, but in the truest sense.  Jane overcomes a terrible childhood to become a governess.  Even though she falls in love with the master of house she is able to control her emotions and conduct herself with dignity.  It's a beautiful love story and well worth watching."
4533,767020294,5,the story is great the acting was terrific
4534,767020294,5,I am happy with my purchase. I would buy from seller again.
4535,767020294,4,Good movie.
4536,767020294,5,Best Jane Eyre movie ever! I like this version the best! Much more of the book to it. The acting is superb!
4537,767020294,1,"After years of owning the book, I finally got around to reading it a year or two ago.  Besides this particular adaptation, I've seen 6 others: '11 movie, '06 mini, '96 movie, '83 mini,'73 mini, and '44 movie.
While I believe the story line (500+ page novel) is better suited to a mini series length; I quite enjoyed the latest ('11) movie- despite its being only 2 hrs. long!

As for this particular one:

Don't be fooled by its title, this production is far removed from the book (so if you've never read it, and are seeking an authentic adaptation-- look elsewhere)! The only things that the two have in common are the names of its characters, and a few sequence of events! 95% of the dialogue has been rewritten (and butchered), and some events made up!

Rochester is an insufferable, maniacal, beast of a man!  With a constant scowl on his face, and a snappish bark of a tone.
How Jane could have felt anything beyond oppression and disdain is beyond me! Jane's character is even altered; she's borderline bratty, somewhat mouthy, and unreservedly opinionated.
Beyond any and all comprehension she actually loves Rochester (despite his blatant mistreatment of her- especially when she's about to leave)!!
..Thankfully it was only 108 minutes long-- anything beyond that would have been torture!
_________

If you're entirely new to this story, please get acquainted with the book before or after viewing! If you're not a fan of reading (or listening to an audio book), and you'd rather watch an adaptation- I recommend looking into the 1973 or 1983 BBC miniseries. While these earlier productions are a bit dated and theatrical/stagey, they are the most faithful to the book.  As for the latest mini series, the only real advantage it has compared to the '73 & '83 renditions, is that it has the modern cinematic feel/experience (meaning the acting & sets aren't as stiff and theatrical). In my opinion however, it's the weakest adaptation to date.  The dialogue is more modernized, certain events unfaithfully re-written, and the relationship between Rochester & Jane overly romanticized (when compared to the book).
If time is a factor, the movie I recommend is the '11 (although be advised it begins at chapter 28 in the book, and then goes back to Jane's beginning).  There are a couple of deleted scenes that add more background to the story, so you may want to check them out."
4538,767020294,5,One of my absolute favorites!
4539,767020294,3,"I love Jane Eyre and I have tried to watch every version there is to see how close to the book they are.  Cirian Hinds and Samatha Morton are favorite actors as well.  However, I thought this production of Jane Eyre was lacking."
4540,767020294,5,"In my opinion, the best! of all the Jane Eyre movies! Love it!!!!"
4541,767020294,5,"I like this version very much, I recommend it"
4542,767020294,5,I bought this movie to add to my Jane Eyre movies.  It is well acted and most enjoyable.  This is how I introduce my granddaughter to classics.
4543,767020294,3,"I liked it-the actress who played Jane was great, but the Rochester character was a little gruff.  The story line was good, but I do have to say it was not my favorite version and I have several."
4544,767020294,5,"Samantha Morton and Ciarn Hinds work so well together in classic story, great actors, have intensity, enough darkness, enough moodiness to make for intriguing interpretation, the order arrived in good condition and timely."
4545,767020294,5,Each version has plusses and minuses and are priceless because of the artful interpretations and choice of actors.  Much pleasure received when watching.  I especially l love watching Ciaran Hinds.
4546,767020294,5,"Firstly it is one of my favorite stories.
Secondly I think this is the best film of Jane Eyre concerning the acting.
It is extremely emotional without changing the moral i.e. exaggerated love scenes etc.
of the times it takes place."
4547,767020294,5,"Victorian rags-to-riches? Not quite. Institutionalized by her aunt (Deborah Findlay -Cranford), child Jane's life can get no worse. Moved on as a governess at Thornfield, its wealthy owner Mr Rochester (Ciaran Hinds). Jane trifles with love after a not so dignified introduction. There is a strangeness about the house and among those living there. This version dwells little on the child Jane, but focuses on her relationship with her master.
Secrets are hidden behind a closed 3rd floor, a female, a dangerous person. Jane is even required to stop a murder. It is the inner struggle of mature emotion that makes Jane Eyre such a compulsive story, written by Charlotte Bronte as one of her finest novel works.
No faults can be said of this fine cast. Samantha Morton is superb and believable as Jane. Gemma Jones (Last Tango in Halifax) plays Mrs Fairfax here, and has been a favorite of ours since she starred in `The Duchess of Duke Street.'
My wife and I both liked this DVD version of Jane Eyre. Perhaps even better than the 2 other adaptations we own (1971 and 2011) even though we did much approve of one of our favorite actresses, Dame Judi Dench as Mrs Fairfax, in the latter.
SDH SUBTITLES are available. Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, 1997, 112min

4548,767020294,5,"I have had this version for a couple or years.  I loved the very original and saw it multiple times, but this version with Quieran Hinds is by far my favorite......and the hero is perfect, in anything,  He is my favorite  actor.  Samantha Hinds Is excellent, also."
4549,767020294,5,Who can forget Ciran Hinds as Edward Rochester?! Love this adaption of Charlotte Bronte's novel! The supporting cast is splendid as well!
4550,767020294,4,I like Samantha Morton as Jane Eyre she portrays Jane as the solom young lady that she was in the book. Not expecting much from the world but determined to make out there. I was not real crazy about Edward Rochester he seemed to be a little to harsh from the character in the book
4551,767020294,2,I thought this would be the movie that didn't cut out some much of the book when Jane leaves Mr. Rochester. It barely shows the time she spent away from him and her growth as a woman.  I might try the BBC version because it looks longer and might actually include more from the book.
4552,767020294,5,"This has been done so many times, but this is a good version of the story and Ciaran Hinds plays his part quite well. It has an interesting story line from beginning to end."
4553,767020294,5,The best! QUITE a story of female strength in a time of despair. Triumphant story!!!!  A must see movie for everyone!
4554,767020294,5,"The best actors/acting of the many Jane Erye versions, in my opinion.
Ciarin Hinds & Samantha Morton are great together!"
4555,767020294,5,"Samantha Morton is wonderful, but the romantic contrast with her co-star makes this a movie to treasure.  Lots of surprise support, too. The best of many versions."
4556,767020294,5,"After seeing many different versions of Jane Eyre, I have to say this my favorite one by far. This movie shows a very romantic side and Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds are absolutly the best choice to play Jane Erye / Mr. Rochester."
4557,767020294,1,"This version is the 3rd that I have found to have fallen short of the mark.  This one is more likeable of the 3, but still not the best.

  Ciaran Hinds does his best, but it's his delivery.  Any way, it's not one that I want to add to my Jane Eyre collection.

  I can, however, recommend the Timothy Dalton 1983 Version as well as the Toby Stevens 2006 Version. They are fabulous!"
4558,767020294,5,I have seen a lot of different versions of Jane Eyre and this one is my favorite! I would definitely recommend this movie
4559,767020294,5,I love my movie collection 97% was bought from amazon I will continue to collect and I do from this sight and all movies were in excellent condition whether bought pre-owned or brand new not once did I receive a broke or scratched movie . Just make sure you read about the seller that they have good scores and reviews.
4560,767020294,4,This was a summer project. Had to read the book and watch the movie to compare.  It was an assignment what can I say.  It did beat some of the previous summer assignments.
4561,767020294,4,They finally got two interesting actors for the lead roles in this movie adoption - I enjoyed watching it - they really played their parts well.
4562,767020294,5,Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds are in one of the most romantic love stories I have ever seen on film.
4563,767020294,5,I must have read the book hundreds of times in my youth. This is my favorite Jane Eyre movie. The movie was wonderful.
4564,767020294,5,"I've seen nearly all of the Jane Eyre movies and this one by far is the best one. Mr. Rochester is very passionate and lively and Jane plays her part perfectly. Of course, the script is very important as well. The actors can only follow what is written for them. And that was most excellent as well. Adele played her part perfectly as well as the others.
I don't believe that you can follow every word of the book and come up with a movie that is watchable, at least not in this case. This was a well written script and very enjoyable to watch with heartfelt actors who are very good at their craft.
I've seen some Jane Eyre movies where they drop the ball at the end. What happened? They stink. This one took the ending and made it perfect, just as I would expect for such a wonderful movie!!
I'm not putting down all the other movies. Some are quite good. I'm just saying that this one is, IMHO, the most enjoyable."
4565,767020294,5,"I saw this ages ago and it is still by far the most perfectly cast retelling of Jane Eyre I've ever seen.
Mr. Rochester is not supposed to be a young, handsome gentleman (sorry Fassbender). Ciaran Hinds is none of those things but still is wildly attractive as his character. Samantha Morton is pitch perfect as well. I've been wanting to see this again for a long time. I'm so glad I finally made the purchase."
4566,767020294,5,"This is a beautiful version of ""Jane Eyre.""  The clothing and decor seem to be perfect for the time period.  Top notch!"
4567,767020294,3,"I love collecting the different movie versions of this story.  I only lack the 1973 version at this point.  Samantha Morton plays a sassy Jane and Ciaran Hinds a rather moody and angry Mr. Rochester.  However, I appreciate the interpretation.  You can always check it out on You Tube (try Jane Eyre 1997) before you buy it."
4568,767020294,5,"This is the best version of Jane Eyre ever made. Samantha Norton and Ciaran Hinds' performances are splendid.

I'll will recomend it to all my friends."
4569,767020294,5,"He is one of the best Mr Rochester's ever
I am glad that I added it to my collection of
Jane Eyre movies"
4570,767020294,5,I love the different versions of this story its just depend of your liking Cerion Hinds and Samantha Morton  Verses the other other 3 versions  know of .. this was a great version of this pair actors
4571,767020294,5,"probably one of the best jane eyre ever,,,you will love it - well done, great for a family gathering or a peaceful evening together... the acting is well done, the story is well done - you like jane eyre...you will love this one"
4572,767020294,3,"While Smantha Morton is an excllent Jane, the gentleman who played the lead was a little too bold for this role."
4573,767020294,3,"Ciaran Hinds was a little too gruff, like Orson Wells, when he could've shown more of his sensitive side...but it must've been difficult to bring that out in him with his wooden and dowdy leading lady. I was annoyed with her by the end of the movie.  They had no chemistry, and she had the personality of a woman suited to marry the town preacher.  Ciaran's eyes were worth watching it, that's all I've left to say."
4574,767020294,5,"This is my favorite version of ""Jane Eyre.""  Believable, lifelike characters, and good acting.  Keeps one's interest throughout.  I highly recommend this film."
4575,767020294,5,I love this version.  It doesn't matter how many times I watch it I still cry when Jane comes back.
4576,767020294,5,"I didn't think any remake of ""Jane Eyre"" could possibly be better than the version starring Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine.  This one is right up there.  I've watched it often, and I'm pleased that I could finally own a copy.  If you like the Bronte's books, I highly recommend this movie."
4577,767020294,5,"This is a true girls move and makes my wife and her girlfriends quiet for at least two hours, happy Wife happy Life"
4578,767020294,3,"I am puzzled as to why the director, producers, and writers of this so-called adaptation of Jane Eyre decided to stray so far from the actual novel by Charlotte Bront. Not only were several key scenes deleted, they chose to put in words and scenes that were never in the book. So why did I give it a three-star rating? Well, this is because of the wonderful acting by the main characters.

Samantha Morton, whose luminous beauty is portrayed subtly here, plays plain Jane Eyre, whose intellect and high moral character is wonderfully and credibly depicted here. Mr. Rochester is played by the consummate Ciaran Hinds who first impressed me in his performance as the lead character in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mayor-of-Casterbridge/dp/B0000AQS3P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mayor of Casterbridge</a>&nbsp;and who delivered a finely nuanced performance as the once thwarted in love Captain Frederick Wentworth in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Persuasion/dp/B001DUDKEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Persuasion</a>. Both actors deliver credible, compelling performances and the age gap is certainly true to the novel, though many of the dialogue and scenes may not. The chemistry is believable, though not the best of all the adaptations.

The cinematography is beautiful enough though the score is forgettable, and ultimately, I would rate this as one of the weakest adaptations of Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre. That being said, I would still recommend watching it if you're a fan of Hinds and Morton and also if only to do some comparisons with other adaptations."
4579,767020294,5,Samantha Morton won my heart in this absolutely amazing movie. I ended up purchasing every movie she made after seeing her in this. She's a really Great actress and I'm sure most anyone would enjoy this movie.
4580,767020294,5,"I loved this version of Jane Eyre. Ciaran Hinds is perfect as Mr. Rochester, the directing and production design was wonderful. Don't miss this one!"
4581,767020294,5,"I love Charlotte Bronte's novel, Jane Eyre, and I've read it several times.  Also an avid movie fan, I have seen almost every production of Jane Eyre.  I have to admit, being a classic movie lover, I still place the Orson Wells/Joan Fontaine version first among them all, and not because it was absolutely true to the novel, but because it was the most successful of all versions in creating the gothic mood of the Bronte novel in the grand Hollywood manner.  Of course, it also had Orson Wells, whose masterful portrayal of Rochester gave the character such depth and mystery as to forever seal the part in his name.

However, this version starring Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton is my second favorite for several reasons.  First, the casting was perfect.  Ciaran Hinds does a wonderful job portraying Edward Rochester, a complex, authoritative and tortured man who is hiding a horrible secret.  He is supposed to be almost 20 years older than Jane and not overly handsome--although not as moody and dark as Orson wells, he gives the character more humor and fits the bill admirably.  Samantha Morton is simply fantastic as Jane Eyre.  She is my favorite of all the female leads to date.  She is not as pretty as Joan Fontaine or Mia Wasikowska, but she is attractive enough to be pleasant to watch.  (Jane is supposed to be ""plain."")  Her Jane has much more personality compared to other actresses who have played the part.  She gives us a strong, confident Jane while showing us enough warmth to make her sympathetic to the viewer.  She is Jane Eyre in my eyes.  The two leads have one thing that many other versions do not--fantastic chemistry!!!  Together, they sizzle on the screen, which is something you would not expect from these two as a couple.

The production is fantastic, as is the photography and script adaptation.  I have only two beefs with this production--first, the actress playing Adele was too old and rather irritating.  Second, I absolutely hate the singing voice they dubbed in for Edward/Ciaran--that high, operatic tenor just didn't seem like it could come out of his throat.  If they could have fixed those two things, this would have been the perfect version.

As for the other versions I have seen, I'll list them here in my order of preference with a quick review:

3)  2011 Version with Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fessbender:  My third favorite; major problems include Mia being way too pretty to play Jane, and she needed a bit more personality.  Michael Fessbender was admirable as Rochester, but he physically did not fit the part--too handsome and too ""blonde"".  Rochester was always referred to being dark, mysterious with black hair and eyes--hard to get past that part, but he is a sexy man.
4)  2007 Masterpiece Theatre version with Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens:  Non-descript actors, but a decent production.  Except for one hot scene with Jane and Edward on the bed (which would NEVER have happened in the novel), sort of forgettable.
5)  1971 Version with George C. Scott and Susannah York:  Miscast; both leads were too old for the parts--so/so version, nothing too much going on here.
6)  2003 Version with Willian Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg:  I like Willian Hurt, but I hated him in this part.  Too blonde, too cold, no mystery here.  Charlotte Gainsbourg was painfully plain with NO personality.  This was as dry as toast and uninteresting with little to hold your attention.  NO chemistry between the two leads--absolutely none.
7)  BBC Version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke:  There is a good thing and a bad thing about this version and they both are Timothy Dalton!  He is WAY TOO HANDSOME to play Edward.  There is a part in this version where Edward asks Jane, ""Do you find me handsome?"" and she answers ""No.""  What a laugh!  Timothy Dalton is pure eye candy.  No one could get past this without laughing.  He was horribly miscast as the brooding and mysterious Edward.  On the plus side, he is the only good thing about this production!  His acting holds the whole thing together--the actress they have playing Jane has as much personality as a pet rock.  Not attractive, which isn't a major problem because Jane is supposed to be rather plain, she should have at least SOME qualities to make her feasibly attractive to the fantastically handsome Timothy Dalton.  In real life, Ol' Tim wouldn't have looked twice in her direction.  Also, her acting was wooden, and she had this horrible pimple or wart on her face that kept moving about in different scenes--it drove me crazy.  So, after seeing the rather lack-luster Jane, Timothy Dalton is the entire production.  It is a dated and small production; hard to watch after viewing the other movie versions--but I do realize that this was an early made for TV/BBC production so you can't expect much.  I know many will call me out for trashing their beloved BBC production, but I have to call it as I see it."
4582,767020294,4,"Not surprisingly, the reviews of this movie are all over the board.  I have to say that I think the actors playing Rochester and Jane did a great job.  Rochester has been described as a screamer, and while I can see why people say that, Rochester IS a very emotional character.  I didn't find that a problem.  I did find the language and liberties taken with some scenes unfortunate - I am not against modifying dialogue to help the flow of the movie, but too many liberties were taken here!  That being said, I really, really enjoyed this movie.  I enjoyed seeing a short Jane Eyre, and all the stuff that was cut out were the things that you tend to want to hurry through when you're reading it anyway.  In fact, I have been guilty of skipping through Jane's childhood in one or two of the versions that I own.  :D  This movie also totally skips the whole issue of Jane gaining an independence, which in the grand scheme of things, doesn't really matter too much to the meat of the story."
4583,767020294,1,"Ciaran Hinds, one of my favorite actors, portrayed Rochester as a hysterical bully.
I was amazed that Jane, a sensible girl, would find anything admirable or lovable about the character."
4584,767020294,5,"I'm not into Drama, love comedy whatever type films. I usually stick with Horror, Sci-fi, Fantasy, Crime Documentaries. However, the story of Jane Eyre is ONE, and I think the only one, of my favorite love stories that I can watch and get engrossed in. I have seen the 1983 (Dalton), 1996 (Hurt), 1997 (Hinds), and the 2006 (Toby Stephens), and may get around to watching the new one 2011 with Fassbender. Out of all of them, the 1983 is my FAV!!! It stays very close to the book and is longer so you get to see more character and relationship development. The storyline is more detailed - love it!

But I digress. What I like about this 1997 movie version with Morton and Hinds, is that they were able to still build that love relationship in a very short amount of time. Coupled with an AWESOME score done by Richard Harvey (which I wish he made into an OST), you're able to see the development and feel their torment and joy. Albeit a short film, the scenes are shot beautifully. They filmed the parts that were important from the story; and for anyone who didn't read the book or watched the mini series, you wouldn't be able to tell how short the story was because the story line flows fluidly. So you're not left confused. The ending is beautiful as should any love story should be. Of course I cried in the end :) All in all, they pulled off a really good movie from this awesome timeless story. I think it deserves a 5 star.

If you would like to see a more in depth version of Jane Eyre, definitely check out the 1983 with Tim Dalton. The man was FINE in that one and I believe Zelah Clarke, was the closest to portraying the true Jane. The 2006 version is also close to the story and is shorter than the 1983 by only a few minutes. But to me, it lacks a bit of luster. The emotions Jane portrays seems a bit off in some moments. And Toby Stephens just didn't do it for me as Mr. Rochester. He seems more soft spoken. Maybe it's because I keep comparing it to the 1983 version, naturally :). But the 2006 version is shot with up to date technology in the same natural authentic setting (the English moors), so the picture quality is very good."
4585,767020294,3,"The essence of my rant:  Samantha Morton good, Ciaran Hinds bad. Adaptation so-so. Pacing of film too hurried.

Although this is a more technically faithful adaptation than some I've seen, it was more of a gothic cartoon than a Monet impression of Bronte's novel. A good screenplay of a classic is deft in its choices of what passages to highlight and what to skip, what dialogue will be the best tribute to the original work but bring the characters to life;  what will illuminate the spirit of the novel. This lingered too long on some scenes and skipped over others, so that anyone who has not read the book might wonder what just happened, and it went too hard on some characters and too soft on others, making it harder to grasp their places in the story.

Samantha Morton is a fine choice for Jane--she played it in a mousy, understated way, with a few glimmers of a suppressed personality that was a decent depiction of the character.  And she looked nineteen, which is nice.  However, this served to highlight the creepiness factor when Ciaran Hinds as Edward Rochester comes growling and cussing into the story, acting more deranged and dangerous than his imprisoned wife.  The Hitleresque mustache, looming posture and unblinking stare make him more menacing than sad and brooding.  He barks and snarls his lines with no hint of the intended facetious humor and vulnerability that make Rochester a redeemable character.  When he does make romantic overtures toward Jane, it feels repellent and lecherous.  Not sexy at all.  It seems like Jane needs an intervention rather than finds the love of her life.

Want a better, more lush, fleshed-out, warm-hearted version?  Although he does not answer the Rochester character in looks as well as Hinds, Tobey Stephens in the Masterpiece Theatre production is way, way better:  rude and gruff by turns, guilty over his inability to be kind to Adele, with a tortured sense of duty to Bertha, his expressions and manner soften, his banter with Jane is amusing and the pivotal romantic scene is tender, fulfilling in the way it should be. Wilson is lovely, plain one moment and a shining pearl the next--perfect casting there.  Basically, you can picture Ruth Wilson and Stephens making love, and the thought does not make you shudder.  There you have it:  this should be a love story."
4586,767020294,1,"I'm frankly surprised that this ""version"" has so many positive reviews!
While I love the book, I'm not what you would call a ""purist"".  Besides this one, I've seen 6 others ('11 movie, '06 mini, '96 movie, '83 mini,'73 mini, and '44 movie).
While I believe the story line (500+ page novel) is better suited to a miniseries (length); I quite enjoyed the latest ('11) movie- despite its being only 2 hrs. long!

As for this particular one:

Don't be fooled by its title, this production is far removed from the book (so if you've never read it, and are seeking an authentic adaptation-- look elsewhere)! The only things that the two have in common are the names of its characters, and a few sequence of events! 95% of the dialogue has been re-written (and butchered), and some events added (made up)!

Rochester is an insufferable, maniacal, beast of a man!
How Jane could have felt anything beyond oppression and disdain is beyond me! Jane's character is even altered; she's borderline bratty, somewhat mouthy, and unreservedly opinionated!
Beyond any and all comprehension she actually loves Rochester (despite his blatant mistreatment of her- especially when she's about to leave)!!

In conclusion, if you dare watch this insufferable abomination, you had better have a pair of ""frownies"" on hand; Rochester's scowl is that infectious!

..Thankfully it was only 108 minutes long-- anything beyond that would have been torture!"
4587,767020294,3,"Jane is an orphan who first becomes a teacher at the rather grim school for orphans where she was raised, then takes a job as governess for a little french girl who is the natural child of a cranky Mr. Rochester. She can't help loving him, and eventually he is equally in love with her, in spite of the attempts of a wealthy neighbor to hook him. They plan to wed, and are at the altar when a man gallops up to the church and announces that the wedding must not take place.

From there you have to either read the book or see the movie; I've told you enough already. Modern audiences will be shouting at her not to be such a prude, but this is Victorian era, after all. And the girl has guts, which finally serves her well. The movie is well done, but it's a pretty bleak story."
4588,767020294,5,"I saw this version as a girl. It has been a favorite.
probably always will be. I have see just about every version out there."
4589,767087372,2,"The series is a gem.  Believe every positive review about it. It is television at its best. The only outrage is the poor quality of the transfer on the A&E set released in the US and Canada.  The picture, colours, sound are awful. I bought the set and returned it.  I saw the United Kingdom release, Region 2 encoded, and it is much better.  You can get an idea of the difference in picture and colour quality on the Upstairs Downstairs web site, video availability page at [...]  A&E should be ashamed to give this excellent series such a bad treatment and charge over $300 for the insult."
4590,767087372,5,"The most amazing aspect of this collection is how well it holds up after all these years.  Having initially seen in the 70s, I wasn't prepared to be surprised. After all, didn't I know all the plots and characters?  But what I found was, while I remembered most of it, there were huge chunks that I couldn't account for.  I've watched the entire series now, some five times, all the way through, and it only gets better.  The writing alone is worth the price of admission, but couple this with excellent acting, stellar camera work, and knockout sets, and you've got the superb drama that is UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS.  Please, don't call this a soap opera--this is an insult to the writers and actors.  This is great drama that just happened to be spread out over a couple of years.  Here are just a few examples of what I'm talking about:
THE WRITING:  The characters are not cardboard cutouts, but real, fallible people. Lord Bellamy, for all his wisdom and charm, does make some bad decisions (the stock tip scandal, the attempted bribe of the parents' whose infant Mrs. Bridges has abducted), and this only makes him more likeable.  Who wants a stodgy old Edwardian man that's perfect?  Then there's the subtle references to what's come before, so that if you've missed an episode or two, you'll still know what the characters are talking about.  References to Lady Marjorie and the Titanic, the previous maids and footmen who have come and gone, etc.  While this is somewhat standard in television and series writing, the deft handling of these references makes this series unique.
CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:  One of the finest examples of this is Edward, the footman.  Always joking and playful, his is probably the most dramatic change during the series.  When WWI breaks out, he's off to the front, only to come back shell-shocked.  His transformation from a rollicking and randy young man, to that of a worn-out and scared soldier is remarkable.  The one scene where Bellamy finds him on the stairs and comforts him in the morning room is worthy of an award.  Reminiscent of ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" the performance Christopher Beeny gives in only a few minutes is one of the best ever seen on television.
THE SETS:  With exquisite tastefulness, the sets on ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" are the best example of Edwardian decor ever to grace the screen. Never mawkish or overblown, they nevertheless hark back to a tasteful Victorian era without all the fuss, yet embrace the Edwardian era and the ""moving forward"" theme that permeates the series.  It's amazing what one expertly placed kentia palm will do for good drama.
CASTING:  This one's a no-brainer.  Whoever did the casting deserves a gold star.  The regulars are loveable with faults, and the guest appearances add just enough spice to the affair to keep you on your toes.  Especially liked was the character of Alfred---surly, evil, comic, and dramatic, he's one of the highlights in the collection.
My only dislike of this series was that it eventually ended.  It was a mark of genius to show the period from 1904 to the stock market crash, with WWI being the centerpiece.  Overall, this is probably the best series ever created for television, and like all great works of art, the formula probably won't be repeated in our lifetime.  There aren't enough stars for this one."
4591,767087372,5,"This is one of the best shows ever created for television. The acting was incredible, the scripts thought provoking and the period details were amazing.
Angela Baddely's Mrs Bridges and Gordon Jackson's Mr. Hudson are 2 of the most unforgettable characters in TV history. They were so real they really were the glue that held this show together. Add to that Jean Marsh as Rose (how could you not love her) The whole cast was incredible - even some members (like Pauline Collins as Sarah) who weren't in all the episodes are unforgettable.
The show is just incredible and you don't think it can get any better. Then the war years happen and the show is even better than it was before. These war episodes are classic. There is some great acting by the ""upstairs"" characters in those years (Simon Williams as James, Lesly Anne Down as Georgina & Meg Wynn Owen as Hazel especially) - also ""downstairs"" Christopher Beeny as Edward just breaks your heart in these.
This is a must have if you love drama on television. I am so jealous of someone who has never seen them before.
Some of the color quality on the DVD isn't great and some of the sound. I think this is because the series is older. I don't think it takes away from how great the show is or your experience watching it. Ignore the other reviews and enjoy this great show."
4592,767087372,5,"This is nothing short of an investment for any serious DVD collector. This series wasn't 'commerical' but has turned out be one of the most important television series ever made. Broadcast is numerous countries it is fondly remembered.
Highlights would be seasons 2 and 3 when the show really hit its stride; characters where clearly defined and the scripts had more clarity.
Not forgeting the harrowing 4th WW1 series and the final series when eaton place struggles to remain relevant in the roaring 20s.
Worth getting as a set because you'll be hooked after the first season.
For those that remember it from ""back in the day"", Yes, it is just as great as you remember...
Perfection."
4593,767087372,5,"This box set comprises the entire series of UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS (all 68 episodes spread across 20 discs), and is well worth the price.  This wonderful series has become a British institution and a worldwide favorite among viewers.  It has a huge fan following.
The story follows the lives and loves of the Bellamy family who reside in a fashionable house in Eaton Place.  Downstairs, their loyal and lively servants uphold their own code of values whilst trying to come to terms with an ever-changing world.  UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS covers the years 1903-1930, and features fantastic writing and direction, not to mention top-drawer performances from a gloriously talented cast.
Season 1 - We are introduced to the Bellamy family:  Richard (David Langton), his wife Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) and their grown-up children James (Simon Williams) and Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett).  In the first episode, ""On Trial"", we also meet the vivacious Clemence (Pauline Collins) who arrives at 165 Eaton Place looking for a job.  After Lady Marjorie re-names the girl Sarah, she's quickly inducted into the household, but finds life as a servant frustrating and unnatural.
Later choice moments in the season include ""Magic Casements"", where Lady Marjorie has a brief and tender affair with a young army captain; ""The Path of Duty"" features the rebellious Elizabeth running away from home on the eve of her society debut; ""Why is Her Door Locked?"" recounts the unhappy, emotionally-disturbed Mrs Bridges (Angela Baddeley) kidnapping a small child.  The season ends on a hopeful note as Elizabeth marries the romantic poet Lawrence Kirbridge (Ian Ogilvy) in ""For Love of Love"".
Season 2 - Picks up the story following Elizabeth and Lawrence's honeymoon, and their household in Greenwich.  Humorous scenes downstairs featuring Rose (Jean Marsh), Thomas (John Alderton) and Mrs Fellowes (Dorothy Frere) contrast dramatically with the unhappy marriage of Elizabeth and Lawrence upstairs.
Other standout episodes include ""Your Obediant Servant"", where Hudson (Gordon Jackson) dresses up as a toff in order to impress his brother's family who are visiting from India; ""The Property of a Lady"" where Sarah and Thomas attempt to help Lady Marjorie who's being blackmailed about her secret affair from Season 1; and ""Out of the Everywhere"" where the resourceful Sarah once again saves the day for the Bellamy's.  Perhaps the season is best-remembered for ""Guest of Honour"" in which King Edward comes to dine at 165.  This season marked the last for Elizabeth, Thomas and Sarah.
Season 3 - Another strong season, which gets off to a cracking start in ""Miss Forrest"", in which Richard has hired the services of secretary Hazel Forrest (Meg Wynn Owen) while he is busy writing Lord Southwold's political biography.  Lady Marjorie is getting ready for a voyage on the Titanic...
Later standouts include ""A Perfect Stranger"" where Rose gets her first taste of real love when she meets charming Gregory Wilmot (Keith Barron), an Australian sheep-farmer. Romance also keeps up James who impetuously proposes to and marries the mild-mannered Hazel;  ""Goodwill to all Men"" introduces us to Lord Southwold's young ward Georgina Worsley (Lesley-Anne Down), and a charming storyline featuring the second (and last) appearance of Cathleen Nesbitt as Dowager Lady Southwold.  The season ends on a dramatic note when World War One is declared.
Season 4 - Generally regarded by fans as the strongest of the five seasons, with superb acting and cracker storylines.  The season starts off with ""A Patriotic Offering"" where Lady Prudence (Joan Benham) suggests that Hazel takes in a family of Belgian refugees.  ""The Beastly Hun"" features an Emmy-winning performance from Gordon Jackson; whilst ""If You Were the Only Girl in the World"" has Hazel falling in love with a handsome young airman who is later tragically killed in a bombing strike.  The season also introduces us to the charming naval widow Virginia Hamilton (Hannah Gordon), who turns to Richard for help when her oldest son is to be court-martialled.  The season ends on a tragic note when Hazel contracts a severe and dangerous strain of the flu virus just as peace is declared by England.
Season 5 - James and Georgina settle into a party lifestyle with their mindless society friends, whilst the newly-married Richard and Virginia settle into life at Eaton Place with her two young children Alice (Anne Yarker) and William (Jonathan Seely).  ""A Place in the World"" details bored and dissatisfied James following his father in politics; ""Disillusion"" follows an ill-fated romance between Hudson and young maid Lily (Karen Dotrice), and Georgina toys with a career as a movie actress in ""Alberto"".  The season ends with the marriage of Georgina and Robert, the Marquis of Stockbridge (Anthony Andrews).  James returns from a trip to America with big dreams about the Stock Exchange, but then the Wall Street crash puts the financial future of  the Bellamy's in doubt...
There aren't enough words to express how much I love UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS.  My favorite moments from the series come mostly from seasons 1 and 2, and while I love the entire series, I particularly love the performances of Nicola Pagett (Elizabeth) and Pauline Collins (Sarah).
If you are a fan of the series or a fan of British period drama, then I highly-recommend this superb series!  A must-own."
4594,767087372,5,"Upstairs Downstairs is BY far the very most exellent tc drama ever. The BBC is masters in crating tv drama ,but this masterpice
is on in a life time.
A perfect blend of drama, fun, timeless entertainment, and an outstanding description og the life of upperclass London.
Not to mention the performances, by those faboluos actors, one can never imagine any others playing the different parts."
4595,767087372,5,"It wasn't commercial.  It wasn't conventional.  It dealt with issues not often talked about in the early 70s, both the social issues that permiate through the series, and also such issues, in certain episodes, as prejudice, suicide, and homosexuality.
  This is the story of the Bellamy household at 165 Eaton Place, London, both the upstairs family (the Bellamy family, led by Richard Bellamy, a member of Parliament) and the downstairs family (the servants, led by Angus Hudson, the butler, who in his way is more aristocratic than the aristocrats).  Yet in many ways, they are a single family, and we see them from the period 1905 to the 1920s, an era of profound social change, and we see the effects such changes have on this household, from a time when going ""into service"" was routine to the time when having half a dozen servants for a small upper middle class family such as the Bellamys was beginning to be the exception, not the rule.
  The series includes rarely shown episodes from the 1st season, as well as the special, Upstairs Downstairs Remembered: The 25th Anniversary Special.  While the special is included with the first series episodes, I would advise waiting until you have viewed the entire series before watching the special, to avoid any plot points being given away.
  The acting is wonderful, led by Gordon Jackson (as Hudson, the butler), David Langton (as Richard Bellamy), and Jean Marsh (as house parlormaid Rose Buck).  Marsh also originated and guided the series.  These three characters seem like rocks, upon which the waves of the social changes beat.  Yet they are worn and changed by the events of this incredible era.  Nonetheless, this is very much an ensemble cast--no character appears in more than 60 of the 68 episodes.
  The first season seems almost experimental--many of the episodes have specific themes, such as those mentioned above.  A couple were unsuccessful and their events are never referred to again (for example, ""The Swedish Tiger"").  In the remaining seasons, events tend to build over the thirteen episodes, to culminate to some extent in the final episode of the season, which usually deals with a major event in the world (for example the King's death at the end of the second season, the start of the war in the third, the end of the war in the fourth).
  Perhaps the most powerful episodes are those dealing with World War I, and the profound waste of the war, as many of the best of the generation are lost.  By the end of the War, there has been tremendous tragedy, and even the most ardent supporter of the war doubts the justice of the war.  But do not underestimate the fifth season, as the social structure crumbles.  The signs of this crumbling are seen throughout the earlier episodes, but they come to a head in the fifth season.
  I have tried  to avoid discussing the plot, so as not to give away the plot events that should come as a surprise to you.  But suffice it to say that this is one of the first series when anything can happen within the framework of the series, when you could not count on everything ending happily by the end of the hour--or at all.
  Brilliant.  Brilliant."
4596,767087372,5,This is a marvelous series. It gives great insight into how the upstairs and downstairs are different in the British aristocratic homes. Absolutely worth the price. I shall watch it as often as I can.
4597,767087372,5,"Upstairs, Downstairs is, in my opinion, the finest extended series of films ever made for television. Spanning five seasons, the writing, acting, and directing were uniformly excellent.
Upstairs are the Bellamy family. The two members that continue for all five seasons are Richard Bellamy, a member of Parliament, and his son James, a Captain in the English army. Downstairs are the servants who are led for all five seasons by Hudson, the butler, Mrs. Bridges, the cook, and Rose, a maid. The performances by all these principals were excellent in every respect.
Dozens of other characters come in and out of the various plots throughout the years. Most notable are Richard Bellamy's first wife Lady Marjorie and a niece, Georgina. Downstairs Edward, the footman and chauffeur, his wife Daisy, and Ruby, helper to Mrs. Bridges, all played important roles in the series.
Many things make this series great and the stories come first. The Bellamy family and their servants are living in tumultuous times, the first thirty years or so of the 20th Century. The 1st World War, ""the war to end all wars,"" was a defining moment in time for the English, the Bellamy family, and their servants. The war changed everyone and everything forever and this series does justice to the horror of that terrible event and its impact on the lives of the English people.
But the war is only a part of the story line, albeit an important one. We come to know the Bellamys and their servants almost as well as our own family. In fact, they seem to become a part of our family, so real are the stories and the performances of the actors. Rarely have actors in a television series ever been able to provide so much depth of characterization. This is due largely to the fine direction and superb dialogue of the scripts for each episode of the series.
For the most part the action takes place in the Bellamy's London home. Over five seasons we see little of London except through the windows of the Bellamy's house. The war footage is a notable exception to this statement. Even so, enough is happening under that roof to keep us genuinely interested and engaged.
I had not seen this series when it originally aired thirty years ago and only by accident saw a video of a first season episode. I was quickly ""hooked"" and then watched the rest of the five seasons on DVD. Other than taking less room on your shelf, the DVDs did not appear to me to be much better than the video I viewed.
It seemed to me as if the program, like a fine wine, aged gracefully and improved over time. I know that I enjoyed each season just a bit more than the last and with great regret watched the final episodes. It was as if I were saying goodbye forever to close friends and family.
This series is good enough for a repeat viewing and so I have the deferred pleasure of knowing I will be reintroduced to the Bellamys and all their servants at some later time. However, for the first-time viewer, a real treat is in store for you!"
4598,767020294,5,"I have the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clark version of Jane Eyre, the George C. Scott/Susannah York version of Jane Eyre, the Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson version of Jane Eyre and the Ciaran Hinds/Samantha Morton version of Jane Eyre--yes, it's one of my favorite movies. Without a doubt, Ciaran Hinds' portrayal of Rochester is head and shoulders above Timothy Dalton as well as Toby Stephens. I do like Toby Stephens but Ciaran Hinds' facial expressions, his emotional portrayal of Rochester is unparalleled.  Samantha Morton is a wonderful Jane, plain yet with an inner beauty, stoic and strong, unemotional on the surface but in love with Mr. Rochester.  She was the ideal actress for this role. I was very disappointed with the portrayal of Jane in the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clark version, for one thing Zelah Clark is so short compared to Dalton, I couldn't watch the movie without thinking she looked like a child in height yet older in her face than Dalton--it was very distracting for me.  She also does not have the range of acting and emotion Samantha Morton gives in her performance--Clark is very bland compared to Morton.  As much as I like Timothy Dalton, he isn't Rochester. The George C. Scott/Susannah York version is good, I really liked George C. Scott as Rochester but not as much as Hinds. Susannah York comes closer to Samantha Morton as Jane than any of the other versions but Samantha Morton still excels in this part.
.
There are many comments about the Hinda/Morton version not closely following the book, I was more interested in the movie than the book, if I purely wanted the book, I would read that and not watch the movie. I've seen the Hinds/Morton Jane Eyre many times, each time I see more and more pure acting ability from Hinds than any other actor in this role, his facial expressions portray as much as his spoken lines. Hinds in excellent in portraying the gruffness and hard edge of Rochester yet tenderness in his passion and love for Jane--Hinds brings Rochester to life. The last scenes of this movie with Hinds' and Morton's recital of love and devotion for each other are nothing short of astounding.  Hinds' tears were real as he poured out his heart to Jane that he was no longer worthy of her, how could she love him now as a wounded blind man unable to care for her--amazing acting on Hinds' part.  The same was true for Morton as Jane, her tears flowed easily and with such realism as she promised to never leave him again, she had returned to him forever.

Of the other versions of Jane Eyre, Toby Stephens as Rochester would be my next choice, even over Scott, but as good as he is, Stephens honestly doesn't hold a candle to Hinds as Rochester. I particularly missed the passion and pure emotion in the last scenes with Stephens and Wilson, it was weak compared to Hinds and Morton. If I want authenticity, perhaps I'll go to the Stephens/Wilson version, for pure enjoyment and richness of acting in a love story, it's Hinds and Morton hands down.  I would have given this movie 4 stars if based totally on the story, but I've given this version 5 stars based on the rich acting of both the lead actors (especially Hinds), they are wonderful."
4599,767020294,1,"Gentle reader,

I hated this version.  I usually enjoy Samantha Morton's work, but she declined to act in this film...and Ciaran Hinds chewed the scenery so much, I'm surprised that there were walls left standing at Thornfield...even after the fire!

There is very little character development in this script and I found myself not caring about Jane or Rochester, which is a problem when presenting ""Jane Eyre.""

For my money, there hasn't been a better, more fully-realized Rochester than Orson Welles."
4600,767020294,5,"This is my favorite Jane Erye adaptation of all, due to excellent acting. Although less true to the book than some others, this Jane Erye offers such good characterizations that one can't but root for both stars, as well as get caught up in the romantic tensions. I loved it."
4601,767020294,5,"This is the best version of the story we have seen, far better than the newest 2011 movie. And believe me, our family has seen them all. We often catch ourselves quoting the movie, especially, ""We are one soul, Jane!"" Yes, it may not follow the book as closely but it is definitely the most dramatic and interesting of all the versions. Hinds and Morton are top notch. The suspense and interplay are entertaining."
4602,767020294,5,"I have long been a fan of Charlotte Bronte's JANE EYRE and have seen every film made of the book.  I own each of them and have viewed each many times.  This version always comes up the winner.  Samantha Morton is a wonderful Jane -- endearing and full of spunk; and Ciaran Hinds' Rochester is just ""unpolished"" enough to make him believeable as the rich, rude, arrogant, and very unhappy Edward.  His acting is superb, and his slightly ""wild"" look makes him even more authentic. Though the film does not strictly follow the book in all instances, it definitely captures the spirit of Bronte's engaging story.  I can always read the book when I want a pure script, but I love this particular film for its larger-than-life characters."
4603,767020294,4,"The actors are true and quite believable to the author's characters in this rendition of ""Jane Eyre"". Although some of the story lines are left out due to production length, it is non the less for it and the emotional connection between the two main character's is never lacking. I've seen many adaptations of this Bronte novel, and this is by far the best in my opinion."
4604,767020294,5,"Mn sales responded very promptly and efficiently to my order. If all companies were on the ball like them, life would be so much easier."
4605,767020294,4,"This is a loose version, some things were added that were not in the book, much was left out.  but a book such as this would have to be a mini-series to remain true.  That being said, I like this version.  Ciran Hinds never disappoints, and is so handsome.  Yes he's stiff in the movie, but so was Edward in the book.  I like it, and will probably buy this version, maybe.  still a couple more versions to see before I select one for my personal library."
4606,767020294,5,"I received this DVD yesterday and watched it immediately. Having seen part of it on TV, my initial feelings were confirmed. This is the best movie rendition out of the 4 Jane Eyre movies I have seen. Ciaran Hinds is fantastic as Mr. Rochester; as I always pictured him, dark, loud, brash, demanding, but hurt and helpless with regard to his situation. Mr. Hinds's acting in this movie prompted me purchase Jane Austen's ""Persuasion"", starring him, and I find it excellent as well."
4607,767020294,5,"I have read Jane Eyre and have seen most of the adaptations currently on the market.  This and the newest Masterpiece Theatre edition are my favorites.  You may want to borrow it from your library first to make sure you like it, but if you fall in love with it as I have, then you will have to own it!  If you do not like it, then all I can say is that I believe film to be a very subjective experience.  Your feelings are yours to own :)"
4608,767087372,1,Multiple VDV's do not work.
4609,767087372,5,good series
4610,767087372,5,"A real masterpiece of a miniseries, covering the lives and loves of the aristocratic Bellamy family and their servants from 1903-1930. Also includes behind the scenes footage, the 40th anniversary special with interviews, and the spinoff series Thomas and Sarah."
4611,767087372,5,"A gift for my mother for Xmas,  enjoying it!"
4612,767087372,5,I love this series
4613,767087372,5,"This is an AMAZING Series, Its a shame the revamp didn't hold up to the original"
4614,767087372,3,Hard to understand at times.  Not on par with Downton Abby.
4615,767087372,5,Love this series and could watch it over and over.
4616,767087372,1,The video is horrible!
4617,767087372,4,this show was the talk of the town  when it fist aired.  It will always be a classic.
4618,767020294,1,"This would have been a very good version of Jane Eyre except for the terrible miscasting of Mr. Rochester. Mr. Hinds simply isn't a romantic lead in any way, shape or form and his Rochester is nowhere near adequate. Its so distracting that I just couldn't believe the relationship between them. Jane wasn't plain enough for the role. Excellent actress though. The role of Jane calls for an actress that can look really drab most of the time then glow with animation at other times which changes her whole face."
4619,767020294,4,"I love this version, although I am biased because it was the first adaptation I had seen.  I adore Ciaran Hinds as Mr. Rochester, and although Samantha Morton captured the fairy quality of Jane Eyre, I never felt she represented the fire she had inside, and there is little chemistry between the two actors onscreen.

Having said that, this condensed version of Jane Eyre moves very quickly, is never boring, in completely enjoyable to watch, and truly captures the spirit of the novel. (SPOILERS AHEAD): the scene when Jane leaves, crying, and you hear Edward call out that this was the purest love, and he should know, he's waited long enough for it, it's just heartbreaking."
4620,767020294,1,"I have seen all the Jane Eyre versions and this one is by far the WORST of all of them! This is the only Jane Eyre version I would never own or buy or even want as gift. The acting was mediocre,not one of the best. Even the latest version that came out this year,that I thought was 'ok', was 100 times better than this one.  I don't know why this actor Ciaran Hinds was picked to play Rochester. I spent the entire movie wondering what Jane saw in him. He was neither attractive nor charming in any way or likeable. I can't find anything good to say about his portrayal or this version. I was not able to sympathize with him at all. I thought either Orson Wells or William Hurt were the worst as Rochester but I could not be more wrong. I can not think of a worse actor to play Rochester than this man. I didn't care much for this actress as Jane either or Adele. I think the dog Pilot was the best actor in this movie. I would not want this version even for free."
4621,767020294,4,"I enjoyed this movie version except that Jane played by Samantha Morton was not the strongest Jane. Jane is a solid and strong inside herself type of person. I love the 'look' as Jane but her acting is just not there. It is like she is too faint and disembodied in the role. Jane is a substantial person with depth. Samantha captures the fairy unworldy part but never is strong and resounding in her performance. It is almost like the role was too much for what she had inside to give to it.

Ciaran Hinds on the other hand carries this version.  He is a GREAT Mr. Rochester! I love the novel and have various movie versions; I was totally surprised by him. He totally carries the flick! With the exception of the kissing scene where he reveals his feelings for her after she returns from being away - the side of the face fake kisses (don't look!).  How did they let all THAT stay in the final? It was so entirely awkward. Forget that part when you see it as it was a total disaster.  But, I was totally surprised by how great he was in this movie.  A good look for him as I did not care for him much in the Jane Austen adapation of Persuasion.

I very much like Gemma Jones who plays the best Mrs. Fairfax; this version fills in the blanks as far as did Mrs. Fairfax know what was going on?  This is the only vesion that does so.

I say this version is good for Jane Eyre fans; Mr. Rochester is what makes it good, not Jane."
4622,767020294,4,If you are a devoted Jane Erye fan you may not like this movie .If you like a romantic movie then you will enjoy this  one I really thought hinds was the Rochester that Bronte was writing about personaley I did like this movie .
4623,767020294,4,While Timothy Daulton remains my all-time great Rochester Morton is my best Jane.  The all-tme best would be Daulton and Morton.  together.
4624,767020294,2,"Do not waste your money on this version - get it at the library if you absoultely want to see it  - it is too short and moves too fast - the actors are actually all very good, especially ""Mrs. Fairfax"" - if you love the book don't even bother watching this, unless you want to see how a classic can be ruined!!  Alot of things are changed or omitted as other reviewers have said - not enough scenes of her childhood life, and not enough of her time with her new found relatives after she leaves Thornfield, etc. etc. Again, very disappointing!!"
4625,767020294,2,"I have seen all versions and for once this one got it all wrong all over the place.  These actors surely had to cringe at the treatment of the classic tale.  For once I found the phrase ""never see the picture after reading the book"" correct.  It would have been kinder to change the name and only allude to the author."
4626,767020294,4,"I really like this version.  I could never get involved in other versions of the story.  The Jane is very well suited.  The original story is condensed, but done well.  You will enjoy it more if you know the full story though."
4627,767020294,2,"I love the book and the 1983 adaptation with Dalton and Clarke is my favorite.  I told my husband years back (then just a bf) how much I love the book and movie and he gifted me this without knowing anything about different versions out there.  I was not even aware of this adaptation myself back then and was curious to see what this Jane Eyre had to offer.  I was horried to witness Ciaran Hinds screeching and screaming all the time like he was having a never-ending PMS.  And let me just say I love Ciaran Hinds.  He is a truly talented actor, amazing in Persuasion and Phantom of the Opera, not a one-note actor by any means.  I don't understand what could possibly happen here.  Did he so grossly misunderstood the character?  I cannot beleive it.  I am  blaming the director (and maybe editors?) for misguiding him into making such a travesty out of Mr. Rochester."
4628,767087372,5,lovely well observed and written unforgettable characters
4629,767087372,5,Great show if you like early 20th century life in London
4630,767087372,3,"Not as interesting as Downton Abby but what can you expect? This definitely showed it's age.
The 1970's back drop did not take place in a castle but if you are still interested in something like Downton Abby make sure that you get the 40th anniversary addition."
4631,767087372,5,love this whole series. If you loved Downton Abbey you will love this series too.
4632,767087372,5,"I received the set of Upstairs, Downstairs and all looks well.  This is a viewing pleasure that I am saving for the rainy Oregon fall and winter.  I am sure I will enjoy it because I enjoyed Downton Abbey so much and wish, somehow, there could be more of that show.  I'm looking forward to watching."
4633,767087372,5,"Once I got started with this, I couldn't stop.  EXCELLENT CONDITION AND FANTASTIC PRICE for a used set.  Money saver, too!"
4634,767087372,5,All as advertised--Great shows--Fine product--Delivered promptly--Thank you
4635,767087372,5,Love these old time stories.  This is an older series but very entertaining.
4636,767087372,5,"We have been very pleased with the Qualtity of the Used set of ""Upstairs Downstairs""  All Dvd's have played well so far."
4637,767087372,4,Good but no Downton Abby. Well worth watching.
4638,767020294,1,"She's the only good aspect of this rendition. Considering that there are so many other versions of this amazing story to enjoy DO NOT waste your time on this one. I'm not the type to lean on the melodramatic, I really am serious about how poopy I thought this version is."
4639,767020294,3,"On a scale of 1-10, this Jane Eyre is a 5, maybe 6.

While Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton are talented performers, this version is just overall lacking. Ciaran Hinds come off as a little too brutish for my taste and certain parts are rushed through.

While one cannot expect a 2 hour movie to encompass every detail of a novel, it is expected that the production team keeps to original novel to a certain degree, which is not the case with this one.

A better JE is the 1974 Michael Jayston/Sorcha Cusick JE, the 1983 Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clark JE or even the 2006 Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson JE."
4640,767020294,3,"although poorly directed, the casting is good.  I was certain Mr Hind could be a good Rochester from his understated performance in Persuasion.

However the characters as protrayed in this version of Jane Eyre badly need more ""understatement"" .  Emotional restraint does not seem to have been demanded of them... or perhaps the director thought this film could be called Jane Eyre with no need to be at all true to the  tone of the book.  Such in-your-face emoting simply turns the film into a sloppy pot boiler. And probably embarasses even the well chosen cast"
4641,767020294,3,"I'm a big Jane Eyre fan, and the book is one of my favorites; thus, I've seen most of the different versions of this famous classic. I loved Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke (I thought the dialogues and Dalton's portrayal of Rochester were unforgettable) and Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson (I loved the chemistry between them) versions. I was hoping that this adaptation was also great especially with Ciaran Hinds in it. However, I was somewhat disappointed. I understand that this version is much shorter than above mentioned adaptations, but still not showing such important scenes like aunt Reed deathbed confession or not giving any explanation who St. John and his sisters (in this version only one sister) are to Jane were disappointing. Also I thought that the scene with Jane and Rochester meeting Blanche while on the way to shopping was useless. However, if you are not familiar with the novel or other adaptations you might like this one. It's basically poor governess falling in love with a master of the house. I gave it 3 stars because of the beautiful scenery, costumes, and settings, and also I thought that Jane and Rochester's age difference was more appropriately portrayed than in other versions. If you're not familiar with Jane Eyre story, I would recommend that you pick up the book or watch Dalton/Clarke version (it's most faithful to the novel) before watching this movie."
4642,767020294,4,"Admittedly, this is a truncated version, which is not entirely faithful to the novel.  If this is a problem for anyone, this is not a version for you (many others to choose from).  However, I cannot help liking just about anything with Ciaran Hinds in it.  IMO, he IS Mr. Rochester.  I also loved Samantha Morton as Jane.

I kind of just wish that they used these same actors and plugged them into a more full length miniseries, rather than a feature length film.  Jane Eyre really needs to be done as a miniseries.

That said, this is a workable, enjoyable version well worth a view for Hinds and Morton."
4643,767020294,1,"What makes Jane Eyre a timeless novel is it's brilliantly colorful and evocative narrative. Charlotte Bronte's true talent is in her wording and her vivid and unique characters. This movie falls desperately short on these most important fronts. The narrative to this adaptation is poor indeed and lacks any of the fiery spark of the novel. Rather than choosing to re-work the first section of the story touching on Jane's childhood, a voice-over jumps from moment to moment so that we have only brief flashes of her early life, making for a stilted and bumbling beginning. The filmography is desperately lacking, and by inserting ""imaginary"" voices and images into Jane's perception, appears to imply a psychotic rather than imaginative narrator. Samantha Morton, whose work is usually delightful and full of life, is the image of Jane without any of the spirit. Ciaran Hinds, though he has some of Mr. Rochester's manner, is lacking in the overall demeanor. Gemma Jones makes for an unnecessarily snappish Mrs. Fairfax and Timia Berthone's acting is self-conscious to the point of embarrassment.

I am deeply disappointed in A&E whose work can usually be depending upon. Overall, this was a waste of the $2.00 spent on rental fees."
4644,767020294,2,"I've been wanting to watch this version of JE for years. Despite seeing scores of negative reviews here, I thought to myself--it can't possibly be that bad. It was made back in A&E's classics heyday. [Remember when A&E once stood for Arts & Entertainment? But I diverge.] It's stars Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton. It's Jane Eyre! How could it possibly be mucked up?

Despite having everything going for it, this version doesn't live up to expectations. There are several reasons for this:

~The atmosphere. You won't feel submerged in Jane's world. The sets and costumes look cheap. What is more, the gothic touches are missing. For example, the red room sequence. The camera just flashes around the room-but it doesn't show us the shadows, the things Jane imagines, that make her scared. It's just a room.

~the script. JE is dense book so not everything is going to be able to be packed in a two hour movie but too much was left out of this movie. Where is the gypsy scene? Where is Jane's discovery that she is not solely an orphan but has family? Where's Jane's conversations with Mrs. Reed when she returns home? Even on a basic level, the script suffers--rather than develop plot points, it just jumps to them as the story requires. For example, the St. John sequence is too short. The Blanche Ingram sequence is especially undeveloped.

~the acting. Samantha Morton is the saving grace of this production. Her Jane is gentle but formidable, quiet but with a backbone. Ciaran Hinds is not a one-note actor, but as Mr. Rochester, he is only shown as being agitated, spiteful and mean. Even when he is kind, he is cruel. Jane would never fall in love with this Rochester.

At times, it also feels like a parody. The parody elements particularly come through in the handling of Bertha Rochester. It's like watching a Monty Python sketch when she's onscreen.

In short, this is a dud! It's worth watching in order to be able the appreciate how good the 06 version is. Also, if you are in the know about BBC programs, it can amusing to watch just to see the once and future Captain Wentworths both featured in the same production. Otherwise, skip it."
4645,767020294,2,"I found this interpretation of Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre good. One need only view various interpretations, such as the 1944 Orson Welles film, starring both himself and Joan Fontaine, to appreciate this 1997 version. Twentieth Century Fox's wartime genre encapsulates the studio art department with very poorly executed visuals in the 1944 film. One knows without doubt that this was made in Hollywood.
However, each version is different, with different characterizations,style and pace. This 1997 original A & E version is good stylistically, the lead characters give earnest interpretations, but seem a bit caricatured and one-dimensional.
I have read the various reviews praising the Timothy Dalton version and cannot for the life of me understand the praise. He is entirely too wooden and one-dimensional. One does not even perceive the character of Rochester, with its depths and nuances, in his portrayal.
The best film Jane Eyre thus far, in my opinion, is the BBC 1973 version with Sorcha Cusack and Michael Jayston, also available through Amazon.com. Read my review on this version. It lacks the sumptiousness of the latter entries but the acting is first rate. This 1973 version has been unanimously hailed as one of the best interpretations of Jane Eyre."
4646,767020294,2,"This ""Film"" version of the classic story by Charlotte Bronte is grossly overacted by Ciaran Hinds. Personally, I found him to be too harsh and cruel, barely even nice. However, Samantha Morton balanced it out quite well as the title character, though. I also didn't like the omission of the middle scenes with Mrs. Reed, which I feel are very important to the story. I prefer Timothy Dalton (4 years before he embodied the role of James Bond in ""The Living Daylights"") as Rochester. He was very well suited to the part; I read somewhere that he considers his role as Edward Rochester his personal favourite. Gemma Jones (""Sense & Sensibility"") was great as Mrs. Fairfax. If you're looking for a faithful version of ""Jane Eyre,"" I highly recommend the 1983 BBC miniseries starring Timothy Dalton, the 1944 version starring Orson Welles or the 1996 version starring William Hurt. This film version is Not Rated."
4647,767020294,2,"First of all I would like to say that Samantha morton was one of the best Jane. She was really believable in her role and her acting was fantastic. it is really a pity she got put in this version. I have to main objections to the book which you may read here below if you wish.
My objections to the books are this: First of all I did not like Ciaran Hinds as Mr Rochester. I saw him a few months ago in Persuasion and was so Happy in his portrayal of Captain Wentworth. It was not the case with his sad portrayal of Edward Rochester. He seemed to think that Mr Rochester was an very, very, very angry man and nothing more. I never really liked Edward's character but he was a lot more complicated than that. He may be weak and selfish but he is also brooding, moody and passionate. To see a proper portrayal of Rochester. You must refer to the performances of Micheal Jayston, Toby Stephens and Timothy Dalton. Especially Dalton! Ciaran Hinds did nothing but scream all the time. And I never could imagine Mr. Rochester with a mustache.
Secondly I would have liked the script to be a little closer to the novel. The first half is not that bad but the second is horrid. Nothing is mentioned of Jane inheriting a fortune and one of St John's sister is deleted. And speaking of St John we don't get to know how mesmerizing his character is(And I have definatly seen Rupert Penry-Jones look better). The version was just too short! Jane and Rochester's readmitting their love for each other is shortened into one scene but Morton managed to pull it off quite well. I repeat she is the only cause why I do not give this version one star.
Need I say more? Those are the main things I find disagreable but there are several more I could state, but I will not waste my time and I think I have made my points.
To conclude if you want to watch this movie so badly go watch it on the internet. If it happens to please you and you wish to see it agin then you may buy it. If you wish to see a truly fantastic version. Then I suggest you buy the 1983 version. If you want to see other ones then also buy the 1973  or the 2006 version. They are definitely better than this one.
Thank you for your time."
4648,767087372,5,We watched this series on PBS years ago and decided to get our own copy.
4649,767087372,5,"I absolutely adore this show!!! I have already seen the entire serious but I was very excited to receive the DVD set!! It is the original Downton Abbey, so if you enjoy that show you will enjoy Upstairs Downstairs!! Mine arrived very quickly, while the DVD set box is a bit damaged the cases and DVDs are in perfect condition!!! I look forward to getting caught up in the characters again."
4650,767087372,5,"I LOVE this series and absolutely hated to see it end.  Disc 4 of my set had some annoying background buzzing noise for several minutes of a couple of episodes, but the rest were fine.  A few blurry spots, every one in a while, but I can live with that.  The stories are well worth it.  I will admit it's hard to see some of the main characters leave---like colorful, sassy Sarah; or the elegant Marjorie.  I also missed Elizabeth, but the writers started playing with her character and she lost some of her charm.  I highly recommend this series for anybody who loves to snoop into the lives of the elite while enjoying the far more entertaining personalities of the common folk."
4651,767087372,4,"We love this series.  This edition was issued before widescreen was popular, so comes in a standard screen format."
4652,767087372,5,This classic is one of my favorites - excellent set.
4653,767087372,5,Love these video ps and you go them to us so quickly as well !
4654,767087372,5,Arrived on time before Christmas as promised and as advertised.
4655,767087372,4,good
4656,767087372,5,Promptly delivered in good condition.  Tells a very charming story from two points of view.  Love it.
4657,767087372,2,Some are in Black and White and some in color. It often stalls. I guess the DVD version has some compatibility problems. The sitcom itself is SLOW. I do think I would have enjoyed it - not in a memorable way - but for the day if there hadn't been so many technology problems. I should have and may still send them back as they are basically unviewable unless you have the patience of Job.
4658,767020294,5,"This film follows pretty good with the novel by Charlotte Bronte, the only difference is that this film version makes St. John a little nicer than in the book and never shows that they are related.  Besides this, I think this book is a good adaptation of the novel."
4659,767020294,5,"This is another version of Jane Eyre that I love! This Mr. Edward R., scared me ,at first, with his rough and loud manner, but I started seeing his gentle heart, that he keeps hidden, along with painful, lonely, heartbreaking, secrets of no hope!

  Jane and Edward have a lot in common, and yet they are so different! Jane helps heal, Edward's broken, empty heart, and Edward is the first man that ever loved Jane, she has always been so alone, it did not take him long to see how special Jane, really was!

 In the movie I loved the talk that Edward gives Jane, about Adele's mother, by the lake. And I love the part where Edward asks Jane about, why she did not write him a letter, while she was gone. And I loved the part where Edward asked Jane to watch the sunrise with him! I highly recommend this movie, I liked this version of Jane Eyre very much! I loved the intense, all consuming emotions, of this Mr. Edward R.!

 But the most compelling, heartfelt scene was when Edward ,who was now, a scarred and broken man, with tears rolling down his face, with still so much love for Jane, while Jane helded him in her arms! It makes you wonder how it would feel, to be loved that way! I so love happy endings, and Jane and Edward finally had one!"
4660,767020294,5,"Well, at first I didn't think I was going to like this movie, because Mr. Rochester, who is of course rough at first, was over-the-top irate. He got so wild when Jane ""bewitched"" his horse that I thought he was going to take his wife's place in the attic. So over-the-top was his rough exterior that his passionate scenes with Jane at first evoked from me hearty laughter, which I don't think was the intended effect. She'd never like a guy like that, and he'd...well. I just wasn't seeing it. At first.

So why the five star rating? Because this is a difficult movie to get right. It's not five stars for perfection, but five stars for being far and away the best adaptation of the four I've seen so far.

It spares you lengthy portrayals of the scenes where a little goes a long way (Lowood, also the Auntie's stewardship of Jane, etc.) and instead saves the film for scenes that really need to be developed carefully in order for the lengthy novel to be credible onscreen. That is, Rochester and Jane need time to grow in their relationship. Some adaptations try to rush it and you see Jane falling in love with a crazy, irate cooky guy who explores his deepest affect, out loud and rather distastefully, to what appears onscreen to be a complete stranger not ridiculously fond of him. This version was a very nice effort, but there was one part a bit rushed-her missing him after she simply tells us they had more talks together. A minor detail. Her portrayal was very good and real. Compare it to the 1996 version (Hurt/Gainsbourg) where Rochester comments to Jane about the tears ready to come into her eyes. This is after Jane is forced to watch Rochester with the new chick on the block. Then he says, ""or do I see them there now?"" Problem is, she doesn't look at all like she's upset or about to cry, or even depressed, although perhaps disappointed and maybe slightly wounded. Under these circumstances, Rochester's assessment makes him look self-important, sadistic and weird.

Although, in this version (1997) I think Jane gets too passionate too soon, before Rochester has begun much transformation and become truly transparent and honest which I think took a bit away from the credibility. Then again, Jane comes from Lowood.

Bottom line: For delicate, complex development, sensitive performances, and for sparing us the stuff we don't need much of in favor of the parts that need the time to develop, I give it five. Nicely done."
4661,767020294,3,"Having read Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte in high school and having viewed many version of Jane Eyre, I believe this version is not the best or even the second best - and hence, not worth a person's time or money.

My reasons are as follows:
(1) The film is too short, leaving out too much of the novel. For instance, it completely skips Jane's conversation with her Aunt Reed when her aunt is on her deathbed.

(2) The acting is not as good as might be desired. The actors playing Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester just do not have the correct chemisty. (Disclaimer: I must admit that I always liked Timothy Dalton's performance in the 1983 BBC version, so my judgement might be impaired)

(3) The film does not develop the relationship between Jane and St. John Rivers nearly as much as it should have. Hence, it might be difficult for the viewer who has not read the novel to realize what a difficult choice Jane must make when she decides to refuse St. John's offer.

I recommend the following:

(1) Jane Eyre (1983) with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke - a BBC production totaling 311 minutes

(2) Jane Eyre (2006) with Ruth Wilson (II); Toby Stephens - a Masterpiece Theatre production totaling 228 minutes

Note:
However, I enjoyed this version more than the Jane Eyre (2003) Miramax production with  William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg."
4662,767020294,2,"either skip this one all together, or watch it first- because it's pretty bad.

jane eyre has been my favourite book (i could read the book and watch most of the film versions any time with pleasure) since i was very young, and i ordered this copy thinking i would like it as much as the others.
wrong.

the acting is decent (i wouldn't expect less from Ciarn Hinds), the setting isn't too shabby, and it's fairly true to the the story- however there are few points that drove me absolutely crazy and kept me from getting swept up into the story.

1.) Mr. Rochester is a gruff, touchy type who likes his own way, he does NOT however, scream and yell at the drop of a hat. from the first scene, that's what he pretty much does the entire rest of the film.

2.) samantha morton just isn't jane eyre. period.

3.) Ciarn Hinds' mustache. it made him look like Hitler in a lot of scenes, and quite frankly it ruins all the heart rending moments.

it's sad, because i really wanted to like this movie. i even watched it twice. no good."
4663,767020294,1,"I won't write a diatribe about what I hated with this version, so I'll sum it up in as few points as possible:

-Samantha Morton too cute and young - she looked like she was 12
-Ciaran Hinds: too old and creepy for the part, came across as a raging, shouting bull during the whole movie. Rochester was an angry man but he wasn't THAT angry all the time.
-No chemistry whatsoever between the two characters. Samantha Morton looked mortified to have to kiss Ciaran Hinds in the kissing scenes. Frankly, I'd be mortified too.

Avoid this version as well as the William Hurt/Charlotte Gainsbourg versions- don't let your curiosity to see another version of Jane Eyre get the best of you. They're both awful. See the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke and Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson versions instead."
4664,767020294,5,I thoroughly enjoyed this version of one of my favourite novels. Both of the main actors gave credible and passionate performances to their characters.
4665,767020294,2,"Not a great version.  Both Jane and Edward come off as angry and hard instead of the sympathy inspiring characters they are in the book.  The Timothy Dalton version is much better and truer not only to the book, but to the spirit of the book.  Jane does not leave Thornfield because of her pride, as intimated in this version, she leaves because it would be morally wrong to stay.  The whole book is about doing the right thing despite the main character's own personal desires.  That in the end is what brings her happiness.  Check out the other version before you buy this one."
4666,767020294,2,I am most certain that the dvd release is an A&E abridged version; which they usually broadcast in their reruns and for their Classroom series. There is a more complete version which had originally aired encompassing Jane's school experiences. I'd guess that approximately 30-45 minutes of material are missing from the beginning of the story and was replaced with quickly edited scenes with a voice-over. I've heard this before about other A&E releases I just wish the official description would clarify...I would not have purchased it if I knew this was the case.
4667,767020294,4,"A finely cast Jane (an early role for Samantha Morton) and Rochester (a gruff, wry Ciaran Hinds) make the difference in what is quite a short retelling of the story. In particular, the verbal fencing that goes on as they sound each other out in the early part of the film - an important element in the book - is played expertly.  The 2006 version (Ruth Wilson) has more time to develop detail and a first-class Jane, but perhaps too civilised a Rochester."
4668,767087372,5,"Fast service. .had never seen this series""back in the day"" and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Thanks!"
4669,767087372,5,very heartwarming series.  I will be sad when it is finished.
4670,767087372,1,"This series reminds me of a very poorly written 3rd grade play! Props ie:walls shudder when doors are shut,, you can see the shadow of the boom above the ""actors"" etc. It was bad enough to try and get through this poorly written plot - you also have to put up with a lot of the scenes in episode one in black and white. Whoever said that ""if you love Downton Abby, you'll love this"" was sadly mistaken! Characters come and go from scene to scene and their absence is noted in passing conversation. All actors ""overact"" except for maybe ""Sarah"" and Rose.
Definitely not worth the price, had I known I would not have purchased it."
4671,767087372,5,I remember watching Upstairs Downstairs when I was a teenager. I don't remember it being this entertaining. It's really very good. I love it. But of course Downton is better.
4672,767087372,4,yes
4673,767087372,5,Excellent Item
4674,767087372,2,In Black and white!!?? Poorly produced.  Nothing like the quality of Downton
4675,767087372,5,Excellent movie. I love it.
4676,767087372,5,Loved it so much that I had to buy the full series!  One of those that you will watch over and over.  If you like Downton Abbey or Duchess of Duke Street you will love this.
4677,767087372,5,One of the best series to ever be on PBS.  Have wanted to own these DVD's for a very long time and finally purchased them.  So happy to have found them on Amazon.
4678,767020294,5,"I love this story and this production is absolutely wonderful.  I watch it frequently, whenever my husband is out of town!"
4679,767020294,5,"This movie and cast was well chosen. Mr Rochester (Hinds) Is a not too handsome of a  man ( but I think so), that is a stern and rugged hell of a man. When Jane comes, she is soft and not aware of what a man really is. The two give  ""performances of a lifetime"". I would have to die first before I would let this movie go. Shows what love is supposed to be. ""Inner love""."
4680,767020294,5,"I rented this version of Jane Eyre, watched it three times in four days and decided I had to buy it. I have seen nearly all the other versions (and I'm a huge fan of Timothy Dalton) but none can compare with the raw emotion this film invokes. Ciaran Hinds is perfect as Edward Rochester, as is Samantha Morton as Jane. Certainly, the only fault I found with the film is that is wasn't longer! I have to agree with an earlier review - other versions of this film were good but none brought me to tears, of sadness or of joy, as did the performances here."
4681,767020294,1,"I hated this version of Jane Eyre - it's just wrong in so many ways.  First, while I would agree that most of the actors are well cast, and Samantha Morton is a very apt Jane Eyre, I was incredibly disappointed in Ciaran Hinds.  He is horribly, horribly miscast and, as a result, I have no idea what Jane finds to love in his angry, ranting, flat, and one-dimensional characterization of Rochester.  There's no brooding sadness, no playful charm; he's just abusive and selfish and mean the whole film.

Also, the adaptation is severely lacking in purpose and sacrifices the important themes and relationships that Bronte crafted so well in an attempt to cater to our short attention spans and our desire for cookie cutter romance.  Moments are changed or left out completely, for no apparent reason, creating situations that make no sense (i.e. why does she go home to see Mrs. Reed before she dies? We never find out.) Some scenes are just creepy - like when Mr. Rochester is lustfully stroking her hand after she puts out the fire in his room - very disturbing.  And the dialog has been changed and modernized making the whole thing seem like a bad soap opera.  Please don't insult my intelligence!!!

But the worst aspect of this version is that Jane is not allowed to grow and change and become the independent woman that she needs to be before she can be equal to Rochester and come back to him on her own terms - which is the whole point of the book!  I was actually offended by the ending of the film and felt that throughout Jane is dumbed down and made into a weak, lovesick girl.

The 2006 Masterpiece Theater version is without a doubt the best, followed closely by the Timothy Dalton version.  STAY FAR AWAY from this one."
4682,767020294,1,"This 1997 TV production is called ""Jane Eyre"", but except for a similarity to the plot of the novel there is preciously little in this film to remind you that you are indeed watching an adaptation of Charlotte Bront's literary masterpiece. How they managed to get every single character of the novel wrong - except for Pilot, who is well cast - is a complete mystery to me, but they did. This is the more a pity because with Samantha Morton and Ciarn Hinds they had two good actors, who even physically fit their roles well, but, alas, the greatest talent is of no avail when the concept of the characters is as wrong as in this adaptation. Samantha Morton - young, delicate and plain enough - looks like Jane Eyre, but does not play Jane Eyre. Her Jane is far too bold, even disrespectful at times, self-confident and self-satisfied, bossy and pert. Gone is the interesting duality of Jane's character in the novel, her outward shyness, guardedness and modesty on the one hand and her fire and passion on the other. Morton's Jane speaks her mind boldly right from the beginning and never stops doing so throughout the film. There is no subtlety in her performance, her Jane undergoes no change and no development. The same is sadly also true for the character of Mr. Rochester. Believe it or not, but they indeed managed to turn one of the most interesting and complex figures of English literature into a brute and a bully. Luckily Ciarn Hinds possesses some charisma, but otherwise nothing links him to the eloquent and fascinating character of the novel. Not the slightest attempt was made to explore the depths of Rochester's character, his many contradicting facets, his moodiness, his inner struggle, his humour and his tenderness. The Rochester of the novel is admittedly insolent and harsh at times, but never the unrefined, snarling brute Ciarn Hinds makes him. Yet Hinds is even worse at playing the loving Rochester, and the only feeling he manages to convey is lust.

Unfortunately the misrepresentation of the characters is not limited to the leading roles: Blanche, besides being blonde, is not in the least haughty enough, not to mention the fact that she is nice to Adle, St. John is all smiles and kindness, and the role of Mrs. Fairfax has been unnecessarily puffed up, probably due to the fact that she is played by dear Gemma Jones. Yet some scenes less with Mrs. Fairfax fussing around and some scenes more between Jane and Rochester would have been very helpful to make the audience understand why the two latter fall in love in the first place.

As far as language is concerned this production is another victim of the delusion of some scriptwriters who either think that they can improve on Charlotte Bront's brilliant language or that her 19th century English has to be simplified to become digestible for a modern audience. The result is that the dialogues are severely changed or replaced by the scriptwriter's own banal lines. In either case they have lost all the charm, sparkle and brilliance of the dialogues in the novel. Poor misguided scriptwriter Richard Hawley even deemed it necessary to make Rochester introduce one of his most famous lines - the line about the string that inextricably binds Jane and him together - with the words: ""I know it may sound silly but...."" No, Mr. Hawley, if somebody sounds silly here, it is definitely NOT Charlotte Bront'! Another capital error of judgement - and unfortunately also an insult to good taste - is the way they rewrote the farewell scene between Jane and Rochester after the aborted wedding, a scene, by the by, which in all the modern adaptations has received a particularly brutal treatment. Whereas in the latest Jane Eyre production of 2006 that scene was an outrage to Charlotte Bront's Jane, the way the scene is handled in this adaptation is an outrage to Charlotte Bront's Rochester. What? Rochester insulting Jane when she intends to leave him, bullying her, throwing her suitcase over the banister and telling her to go if she does not love him enough to stay? Absolutely ridiculous! It is hard to imagine what has gotten into the filmmakers to produce such rubbish as this.

This is the worst, but there are many others scenes which are similarly absurd and ludicrous: the first scene of Rochester galloping in slow motion through the mist before he falls into a brook, Grace Poole coming out of the lunatic's room to sniff at Mason's wounds like a wild beast, Rochester sitting on the top of an archway of Thornfield as if he were the court jester and Mason jumping on horseback over the church fence to prevent a marriage of which he has heard only heavens knows how.

Equally lamentable is the filmmakers' inability to represent the correct social behaviour of the 1850ies. Rochester and Jane are far too disrespectful to each other at first and later far too hot. Sentences like ""I feel that your passions are aroused"" are appropriate for ""Sex in the City"", but not for a costume drama, let alone Jane Eyre. Obviously the filmmakers decided not to bother at all - neither about being true to the novel, nor about portraying the novel's era accurately. The result is a sad failure - as both a film and an adaptation of Jane Eyre. The only fact with which the makers of this Jane Eyre can console themselves is that the BBC failed even worse in the subsequent production of Jane Eyre in 2006."
4683,767020294,5,"This is by far the best Jane Eyre out there at this time...the performances are brilliant, the original text respected...the character of Rochester is for once done as it was meant to be done.  I highly recommend, if you like your movies to show some respect for the books they represent."
4684,767020294,3,"This version is bad in so many ways. First of all the movie is too short to relay the entire Jane Eyre novel and to touch on all of the key elements of the book. Jane herself is boring and emotionless, asks too many questions and incredibly bossy. Rochester is alright, except his barking tone in several scenes and his somewhat lusty attitude towards Jane.
Rochester's and Jane's romance develops too suddenly without giving it the proper time to build up, thus they have little to no chemistry.
Many important things are not included in the book such as Jane learning of her rich uncle and receiving her inheritance after meeting the Rivers.  New and rediculous scenes are created such as Rochester and Jane running into Blanche Ingram in town while shopping for their wedding. Blanche herself is unattractive and too nice.
Most of the people in this movie act out of character. Seems like the writers and directors forgot to read the book or decided to create their own story of Jane Eyre.
Skip this and watch the 2006 version."
4685,767020294,5,I HAVE SEEN ALL THE JANE EYRE ADAPTATIONS....THESE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS WERE GREAT TOGETHER..I LOVE CIARAN HINDS ..HE DOES LIKE ALWAYS AN EXCELLENT JOB WITH HIS CHARACTERS..AND AS FOR SAMAMTHA MORGAN..SHE COMPLETED THIS ROLE TO PERFECTION..I THINK THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES..DO NOT ALLOW THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS TO PREVENT THE VIEWING OF THIS CLASSIC MASTERPIECE.
4686,767020294,2,"I think that Samantha Morton's Jane Eyre in Robert Young's 1997 TV adaptation of the great novel, could've been the best screen Jane ever. Morton was 20 years old and the closest in age to the young orphaned governess, childlike in the appearance but strong willed, serene yet very intelligent with acute sense of right or wrong. Two years prior to her Oscar nominated role as a mute girl in Woody Allen's ""Sweet and Lowdown"", Morton proved that she could say a lot by the mere look at her face, by her impressive and speaking eyes alone. It is sad that the film took too many liberties with the book and not only in omitting many important plot lines in order to fit in its 108 minutes length, but with too many changes to the very nature of the novel's two main characters and their relationship. Jane in the scenes with her employer is sometimes too demanding and not as tactful as she is in the book. The changes are especially obvious in Mr. Edward Rochester as he was played by Ciaran Hinds. Hinds is a talented, intense actor but I can't agree or like his reading and interpreting of Mr. Rochester's character. Some his scenes in the film made me cringe. Mr. Edward Rochester of the novel was not yelling or rather barking brute - it was difficult for me to believe that Jane Eyre would come to love so much. I also was unpleasantly surprised with Mr. Rochester openly displaying his affection for Adele. This manifestation was against the logic of his character.

2.5/5"
4687,767020294,2,"I have it in my Jane Eyre collection and the chemistry is not believable at all.  Ciaran Hinds is barking at her the entire time. There is no inflection in his voice that would give way to you believing he had a soft spot for her on more than one occasion. He also didn't have Mr. Rochester's dark wit.  If you want to see Ciaran Hinds in a wonderful movie, see Jane Austen's ""Persuasion.""

Samantha Morton, although a great actress here, played Jane far too impertinent for her position, the era and most importantly for the post-Helen Jane who had a gentle spirit that made Mr. Rochester drawn to her in the first place.

I was glad to see the Bertha portrayal was very close to the book in this one as well as the 83' version.  Unlike, the most recent Masterpiece version that had Bertha looking like she could step out of Thornfield, put on a gown and walk the red carpet.

If you want to see a great and TRUE adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's ""Jane Eyre,"" watch the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version  which still is powerful even after 24 years. Timothy Dalton is the book's tumultous, playful, introspective and passionate Mr. Rochester. Zelah Clarke plays Jane perfectly as unworldly and innocent and knowing her ""station"" so to speak, but also having her own mind. The 83' version wasn't Hollywood's version, it was Bronte's version."
4688,767020294,5,"BBC has filmed a couple of versions (a 248 minute job in 1973, and a 311-minute version ten years later) of ""Jane Eyre"" before.  Due to their greater length, both of those are much more closely stitched to the text.  If you're a stickler for fidelity, you'll probably want to direct your attention thither.

But for me, the Robert Young version from 1997 is easily my favorite.  At 108 minutes, it's sadly abridged, but the more vigorous pace and, more vitally, the sparkling performance on the part of the lead actress, Samantha Morton, more than make up for this defect.

The ending is guaranteed to plaster a smile on your face for the rest of the day."
4689,767020294,4,"This is the FAST FOOD version of Jane Eyre!!!  Still it is quite entertaining.  Music was very good, much better than the BBC 1983 version.  This Jane is the BEST Jane I have seen so far.  She is an incredible actress who portrays all of Jane's emotions.  I am disturbed by so much change in the wordings though.  Also I found myself disliking this Mr. Rochester because he SCREAMS all the times.  ICK!  He definitely looks over 20 years older than Jane.  The best Rochester is the PBS version.  This movies is still worth a look for its entertaining value!"
4690,767020294,5,"This is probably the best film version I've seen of Jane Eyre. One of my friends, who is no fan of the book or the other film versions, commented that she ""got"" the characters for the first time when she caught a rerun on A&E and I'd have to agree. The essence of Jane and Rochester is all here: Passion. It's restrained in ""plain and little"" Jane, who inside is all rebelliousness, and smoldering in Rochester, who here is just as gruff and domineering and bad-tempered as he ought to be. Watching this film I can believe that this version of Rochester and Jane are passionately in love with one another. I don't believe that in the other versions I've seen, including the most recent PBS version. Cutting out portions of the book to get at the meat of the story was a wise decision that made for a much better film."
4691,767020294,3,"It is beyond me how anyone can say this is the best version of Bronte's novel.  Beyond the highly truncated screenplay which makes little attempt to be faithful to the novel, both Morton and Hinds are horribly miscast.  I love both these actors and was initially excited to see them in these roles -- until I sat down to watch it.  Hinds made a wonderful Capt. Wentworth (and many other roles) but as Rochester all he does is shout and bellow his way thru the story.  His Rochester is entirely one-note, a very shallow performance on his part -- there's no dimension, no spark, no inner life.  He seems to have viewed the role as just a cliched cartoonish gothic hero - he doesn't approach the character with any seriousness.  Morton is equally shallow in the role - neither actor seems to have taken their characters seriously.  There are good production values and Morton and Hinds are good enuf that some good moments come thru.  This certainly is superior to the William Hurt/Zeffereli version, but then that's not too difficult.  Even the recent flawed Toby Stephens version is superior to this one as well.  Best versions: 1983 Dalton/Clarke, 1973 Jayston/Cusack, 1970s Scott/York, 1940 Welles/Fontaine"
4692,767020294,1,"I didn't care for this version at all. I thought there was no chemistry between the two leads, and there should be at least some smoldering of repressed emotions. The story was so abbreviated so as to seem just a conventional, brief story of thwarted love--the character development, especially of Jane, was missing in action. No heartbreak, no horror, no sense of Jane's virtue, tough interior and self-reliance, which helped her overcome so many of life's obstacles. Not even much atmospheric scenery. This Mr. Rochester, played by the usually-excellent Ciaran Hines, is utterly forgettable, weak, and miscast. He doesnt have to be handsome, but he does have to be powerful, passionate, sexy, and seething. After all, he keeps a mad wife locked in the attic and he tries to keep that secret while almost commiting bigamy.

Instead, try the Timothy Dalton version which is excellent though now a little low-budget looking,  or the 2007 even sexier and faster-paced version with Toby Stevens and Ruth Wilson, which is outstanding and the best yet. It moves right along, and yet it keeps all the story essentials."
4693,767020294,5,"It is a well made movie based on a great book. I was particularly impressed by the performance of the leading actors Deborah Findley and Ciara'n Hinds. Following their play, you can feel in the whole the deepness and the manifold of the characters."
4694,767020294,4,"Jane Eyre is a classic.  On the depressing side, but if you are in love with Victorian books made into well-made films, this one is a must for your collection."
4695,767020294,3,"I have this version of ""Jane Eyre"" on VHS, and I like it, but can't understand all words, which is why I'm wanting it on DVD.  I agree with one reviewer who disliked Ciaran Hinds' overacting as Mr. Rochester.  However, I'm interested in this version because of him, and Samantha Morton.

Samantha is amazing to me here, as she, if you can believe it, also plays timid little Harriet Smith in Jane Austen's ""Emma"" (A&E version).  What a difference in personality and character!!  And so convincing!

And Ciaran Hinds plays Wentworth in Jane Austen's ""Persuasion"" with Amanda Root as Anne, and of course, he's nothing like Mr. Rochester.

Both ""Emma"" and ""Persuasion"" mentioned above have sub-titles.  I haven't checked yet to see if this version on DVD of ""Jane Eyre"" offers sub-titles, but if it doesn't, I'll be terribly disappointed, and will not purchase it."
4696,767020294,3,"i've seen my share of adaptations of this great story and i'm convinced that there is just too much going on to be able to fit it into 108 minutes of film. still this is pleasurable and i would give it 3.5 stars if allowed.

if given a longer production and more loyalty to the book, i could imagine this would have been a particularly wonderful adaptation. ciaran hinds and samantha morton are wonderful as rochester and jane. i really enjoy watching their performances. i can feel their frustrations and passions. their conversations are powerful although condensed. hinds is an amazing actor, and i enjoyed his portrayal. morton - although hindered by a short script/movie - was excellent. i am convinced morton's portrayal of jane eyre is the best out of all the adaptations i have seen. this makes it particularly disappointing that she (and hinds) were not allowed to fully incorporate all the details of the book, spread out over hours of film. ah yes indeedy, that would be sweet.

so i think the only 'problem' i have with this adaptation is the length and the resulting lack of true-to-book dialogue and story-lines somewhat external to the rochester/jane focus, such as her prolonged visit to her dying aunt, and the real way she met up with mr. rivers and his sisters, and how she inherited a fortune from her uncle. of these ommited or condensed things, i especially miss the grand debates between jane and edward. it doesnt allow the viewer to fully experience the chase, to savor their growing desperate love and passion. (the dalton/clarke 1983 version and the jayston/cusack 1973 version both are long features which follow the book much more closely, if that is what you are looking for.)

however, the condensed story and deviations from the book do not take away from the actor's performances. for example, i found the final scene particularly wonderful. when she finds him a broken man, and he tries to cast her off for her own good, she refuses, and he cries for all his past pains and and present joys. hinds, as i said, is amazing."
4697,767020294,1,"This out of all the many versions of Jane Eyre has to be my least favorite...
Granted Samantha Morton has  a very  adorable fairy/ Elfin like face like Mr Rochesters Description of her, but her acting has  no highs and lows. She stands up to Mr Edwards a little too much giving really snappy answers, seemingly no respect to her employer, which is not fault of  hers, the writing of the script is bad.... and so the direction. Ciaran Hinds  is totally over the top. He is so angry with no understanding, his eyes are  very lustful and at times  crazed.  He is not at all like the character  described in Brontes epic book of a very sad and  tortured man who falls hopelessly in love with the  innocence and singular personality of earnest, honest and yet strong sweet  Jane Eyre that Charlotte Bronte brought so vividly to life with her classic words.

 The over acting of both during the proposal scene is almost comical. To me there is no love, feeling  or chemistry here between the two actors just lust.... He seems to be going through a middle age crises just eyeing up this young girl, and she though supposedy a virgin...  she dosn't act like one.
 Plus this movie  seems very rushed you can never get a good foot hold of the story Especially during Janes childhood. I do also miss the Gypsy scene that is omitted in many of these movies and was expertly done in the Dalton /Clarke mini series, which brought some brief light heartednes to an otherwise very dark story.

If you want to see great versions. I  highly rate the 1944 movie with Orson Wells though it is another abreviatd version, that movie truly captured the spirit and feel. It is moody dark and mysterious. Another is the fantastic Timothy Dalton version which is most accurate to the book of all the movies taking actual lines right from the  Brontes story.  Dalton's and Clarkes acting is simply superbly sublime!

However if you are like me, see them all and make your own decision. They all have something to offer and most are entertaining..."
4698,767020294,4,"I really like this version of Jane Eyre.  Fans of romantic/historical movies will enjoy the detailed sets and costumes as well as the high drama.  Fans of the novel will appreciate a script that's true to the book without ploddingly recreating it word-for-word or--just as bad--peppered with anachronisms in an attempt to make Jane Eyre hip and modern.

Samantha Morton brings Jane's underlying strength of character to life and Ciaran Hinds, as Mr. Rochester, does very well with a character that can easily be overplayed to the point of silliness.  They are supported by a strong cast, including Gemma Jones as Mrs. Fairfax.  The overall production value is as high as the caliber of the acting.

This is a good, strong production, though I do wish that the DVD came with some extras."
4699,767020294,5,"but a journey... and sometimes not a very safe one, filled with terror and pain. And we can only trust that fate will be kind and allow our broken dreams and hearts to be repaired.

This movie is about broken dreams and hearts that were allowed to become whole again, and in it's fairytale manner it transcends healing to the ""romantic"" viewing it.

The best novel can be even better when brought to life with the proper actors, and that is what has been done with this adaptation of Jane Eyre. Samantha Morton does a good job of playing Jane Eyre, (even though I would have liked to have seen Amanda Root (Persuasion)play this character. But I actually bought this movie because Ciaran Hinds plays the lead charcter Mr. Rochester, and he absolutely does not disappoint, and I believe he could make any leading lady shine."
4700,767020294,4,"Given that a book of this length and complexity would be a challenge to film in less than 4-6 hours, I found this version as good as could be expected. Samantha Morton made an excellent Jane, with her innate pride gradually giving way to her deep love for the haughty Mr Rochester, excellently played by Ciaran Hinds. A life-affirming adaptation of a very complex novel, the only raw touch for me was the character of St John Rivers, none of whose coldness and manipulation was shown. The scenery was stunningly filmed and formed the right impression of brooding foreboding. Excellent value for money."
4701,767020294,3,"This is a so so adaptation of the novel into a film. I suppose they had to cut certain plot elements out while creating a motion picture screenplay and I appreciate that. This is a MOVIE not a book in moving pictures. But still, there were a few things that could have made the film even more fantastic and wonderful:

1.) The replacement of Mr. Brockelhurst as head of Lowood school would have been a happy incident in this dark film. It would have satisfied the desire for such a wicked man to get his just desserts.

2.) There was no point changing the character of St. John Rivers who is supposed to be stoic and unemotional to this engaging, flirtatious character in the film. It only made her rejection of him bittersweet since he had been nothing but kind to her from the beginninig.

3.) Why couldn't they show her coming into the 20,000 pounds from her uncle. This happy coincidence is something that can only happen in a film and they should have taken advantage of it. She can end up RICH AND HAPPY.

The plus side is that I suppose JAne's suffering is not as prolonged as it is in the book. There's just enough suffering to not make it insipid. Also, the actors who play Mr. Rochester and Jane do a really good job as do the rest of the cast. There is a lot of using the eyes and body to act not just words. I adored the music which made the whole thing really melodramatic and everything such a novel from such a literary period in such an adaptation should be."
4702,767020294,5,"The William Hurt and Timothy Dalton versions of this movie were good. But, here's a Jane Eyre that I truly enjoyed. An orphan raised in an orphanage, arrives at Thornfield Hall to care for an orphan, and falls in love with her seemingly infallible employer. It is a classic that grips you since in the end, the characters overcome the worst and find true happiness.

The young Jane was fantastic with her willful impestuousness. Samantha Morton brought spunk and humor to her character and I found it refreshing. And, Ciaran Hinds gives a lighthearted yet dramatic performance which makes him the perfect, indomitable, unfathomable, mysterious Edward Rochester. The actors exquisitely portrayed the conflict of pain, love, and passion, so that this movie epitomizes what Bronte fans look forward to."
4703,767020294,4,"This was the first version of Jane Eyre I had ever seen and I enjoyed it very much.  There was a chemistry or ""passion"" between Jane and Rochester.  Samantha Morton played Jane better than anyone to date.  Jane had personality which I think she lacks in other versions.

I thought Ciaran Hinds as Rochester was wonderful.  He was very close to how I imagined Mr. Rochester in the book.  Not handsome but rugged and likeable.  He did tend to be a bully somtimes and that was a negative but he also had a tender side that came out through his facial expressions in a number of scenes between he and Jane.

A few negatives I found with the film are: 1. this version doesn't stay true to the book, much of the dialogue between the characters is rewritten, 2.  sometimes Rochester is a little too angry and 3.  I wish it were longer so that more of the book could be included.

I loved the ending and had butterflies watching it.  I found the passion between the actors moving and can easily watch this version again and again.

If however, you want a version of Jane Eyre that keeps closer to the book, then the Timothy Dalton version (1983) is a better choice.  It too is very good but is a bit dated (I felt like I was watching a play rather than a movie).

Ideally, I would love to see a production of Jane Eyre that is as well done as the A&E version of Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle."
4704,767020294,2,"I'm not going to repeat the plot, nor am I going to go on and on about comparisons with the book.  This is just a critique on this version of JE.  I've seen the others, and this version isn't bad, it's hilarious.

I've never laughed so hard at an adaption which is supposed to be a tragic but uplifting love story.  Oh, let me count the ways....  First, the Jane Eyre character, played by Samantha Morton.  I thought she appeared to be a bit of a vindictive, spiteful, co-dependent girl.  She is a ""Heather"" in Victorian dress.  However, I think she was the perfect for this version of Mr. Rochester.  Oh boy.....

I LOVE Ciarn Hinds, I love his range, his voice, it's a doggone shame that the scriptwriter, director made his character laughable.  Yes, his mannerisms are cringeworthy, and his 'attraction' for Jane, bordered on sexual harassment.  The character's lust for life, and vigor appeared to be a bipolar disorder.

The part that made spit out my water at the TV screen, the scene after he and Jane first shared a passionate kiss.  After we hear Jane narrate how she imagined the kiss or that moment, here comes Mr. Rochester.  Jane addresses him as ""Mr. Rochester"", and he has an expression of perverted that only Austin Powers could love.  He whispers, ""Edward.""  I was waiting for him to wink, wink, nudge, nudge and wiggle his eyebrows.

If you're down in the dumps, this version will make you shake your head and perhaps laugh it off."
4705,767020294,1,"This version was awfully butchered.  It felt like I was fast-forwarding through the entire novel.  The actors were fine, but the dialogue they were given was so trite that I found myself wincing through most of it.  The script lost a lot of the novel's ""punch"" and intensity.  This DVD is definitely going into the Salvation Army bin.  I couldn't sit through it again.

My favorite version of Jane Eyre is still the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton - good dialogue, fine acting, and great film score, plus at 311 minutes the original story remains pretty much in tact.

I also love Timothy Dalton's version of Wuthering Heights - never a dry eye at the end of that one.  Beautiful, haunting film score."
4706,767020294,1,"This line just about sums up the absurdity of this A&E adaptation of our beloved Jane Eyre, which hardly bears any resemblance to the novel. Wouldn't Charlotte Bronte be appalled!

It all starts out well enough, capturing the horrors of the red room episode, and Jane's experiences at Lowood acceptably. It is indeed, in some places, more detailed than my favorite version(Orson Wells/Joan Fontain) could be in 1944, with a running time of about an hour and a half.

But then, everything falls apart when Jane and Rochester meet, and Ciaran Hinds delivers his first horridly overdone speech. There is absolutely no chemistry between the characters; Jane, as played by the lovely bright-eyed Samantha Morton is fiesty, fights back at Rocheter's rudeness(can you blame her?)and doesn't seem to relish the fact that she's supposed to fall in love with Hinds(who can blame her there, either?)who is mean, whiny, and creepy by turns.

Don't look for the romantically poetic speeches, and heart-stopping presence of the eternally excellent Orson Wells, here. Nor the Mild and admirable Jane, who makes Rochester forget his wretched past.

Morton and Hinds either shout or whisper their thoroughly unoriginal and sometimes exceptionally bad diolouge. Especially Hinds, who never stops yelling at Jane, who stands there looking mildly annoyed at her own role.

In the book, and in the Orson Wells/Joan Fantain version, Rochester was troubled, a little moody, and at first very commanding, but after first meeting ever gentle and believably facsinated by and endeared to Jane's originality. It was obvious and convincing why she fell in love with him. In this version, you have to wonder what would make her love this ugly, creepy, angry old man!

There are two scenes which are particularly bad. First, one in which Jane and Rochester go shopping in Milcote the day after their engagement, and meet who else? But Blanche Ingram! looking decidedly middle class and out of place. then ensues a very odd conversation in which Blanche looks slightly disconcerted as Rochester boasts of his coming marriage to ""The governess,""while Jane stands by looking very pleased with herself. after walking away from Blanche, Jane laughs when Rochester jokes about how he used Blanche to make her jeolous. Ha, ha, ha! clever!

The second, if not showing quite as poor judgement and irreverence for the novel, at least makes up for in awkwardness. In the scene where the wedding is interupted by Rochester's brother in law,(followed by the most bratty tantrum yet seen, by Hinds), he takes them up to see his wife. the whole group; jane, Mason, the vicar, and Mrs. Fairfax stand by looking very uncomfortable as Rochester stomps about the madwoman's cell, ranting about how he was tricked into marriage with bertha Mason(a scene which was done with much more class and convincing anguish by Orson Wells)Just when you think this scene can't get any weirder, Rochester suddenly embraces the sobbing Bertha and plants several kisses on the top of her frizzled head. I say lets throw him in there too.

In the scene where Jane leaves, Rochester yells some more, accusing her of only wanting him for his money. it all culminates in her departure, only to meet St. John(cheerful, complacent - compare him with the St. John in the book)who's marriage proposal drives her back to Rochester, in which they exchange this annoyingly sarcastic, and un-Bronte speech:

""So you didn't find anyone else to marry you?"" sneers Rochester.

""I found someone who wanted to marry me."" again, the self-satisfied smile.

Good lord! some advice: rent or buy either the 1944 or 1996(?)versions and enjoy those."
4707,767020294,5,"Yes, they did omit a lot from the book but what can you expect in 2 hours.  I agree that this movie would have been even better as a mini-series but I still liked it.  This movie had something many of the other versions lacked...chemistry and passion between the lead characters.  This is the only version that made me teary eyed, especially at the end at the part when Rochester sobs and says, ""Do not speak these words out of pity Jane.  How can you love me like this?""...and so on.  To me, when a movie moves you like that, it is special.  The music was very moving.

I think that after 150 years, a little creative interpretation of the book is refreshing.  The dialogue was changed but the plot and true meaning of the story remained the same.
I also thought Gemma Jones was excellent as Mrs. Fairfax.  The fact that reviews are so mixed just shows that everyone has their own intterpretation of this classic Bronte novel."
4708,767020294,1,"The characters have the same names as the novel but that is about as far as this version goes to stay true to the characters in Bronte's Jane Eyre.  I've watched many versions of this classic novel, and this is by far the worst.  Ciarn Hinds, who I usually love, plays Mr. Rochester as a raving lunatic, not a tortured man who's life has been turned upside down by an unfortunate mistake as a young man.  There is no chemistry between the characters and the dialogue/plot differs so much from the novel it is a travesty to call this 'Jane Eyre.'  I threw away this DVD after watching it.  A waste of $$$.  Buy the Timothy Dalton version for a true 'Mr. Rochester.'"
4709,767020294,1,"Ever since I first read Jane Eyre years ago, it has been one of my favorite books, with its complex characters and wonderful writing.  Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie, however, was either completely unfamiliar with the book or thought they could do a better job than Charlotte Bronte.  Virtually none of the dialogue is from the book, and when they do keep something (like Rochester's wonderful line about the string connecting him to Jane), it's butchered.  If I weren't already familiar with the plot (or, rather, with how the plot should be), I would've been very confused by the choppiness of this movie, especially towards the end.  For example, Jane hears Rochester calling her name, the next minute she's in a carriage, and the next minute she's at Thornfield.  Wow, that was fast!

Jane's stay with St. John (who is much too nice in his proposal to her) and Diana is reduced to about five minutes, and her aunt's death is completely skipped over.  No mention at all is made of Jane's inheritance from her uncle, or of her family connections to the Rivers family.  Oh, and when Jane and Rochester go shopping in town, they run into Blanche Ingram, for some inexplicable reason.  Of course no movie can keep everything from the book, but this one simply butchered the plot.

And it butchered the characters as well.  Rochester is not supposed to continually bellow and snarl at Jane in the way Ciaran Hinds does in this movie.  (He was such a good Wentworth in Persuasion, I think the fault must lie with the director and script -- very disappointing.)  Nor is Rochester supposed to be a lust-crazed maniac who yells at Jane when she's leaving him, ""You want me!  I can feel your passions are aroused!  Say you want me!  SAY IT!""  He literally bellows at Jane all through this scene -- like when he shouts, ""Didn't I just know you'd desert me!  Really, Jane, you are SO PREDICTABLE!  Couldn't you be just a little more original?!...You're just a child who has NO IDEA WHAT REAL LOVE IS!""  And I use the capital letters because that's how the lines were spoken -- or rather, screamed.  It was impossible to see why any woman in her right mind would fall in love with this Rochester!  This aspect of the film, along with the awful script, made it difficult for me to finish watching the movie.

As for Samantha Morton, she was generally all right, but she overplays the spirited, independent part of Jane's character to the point of being downright rude to Rochester from time to time.  Still, at least her performance was less painful to watch than Ciaran Hinds'.  To summarize, the script and plot bore virtually no resemblance to Charlotte Bronte's original, and Ciaran Hinds' Rochester was a snarling bully, making this movie almost laughably bad.

If you want a good adapatation of Jane Eyre, watch the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke.  Yes, Dalton is too handsome to be a good Rochester physically, but more important than that is his performance, which shows the many facets of Rochester's personality -- not just non-stop anger.  The plot is kept intact (including the famous gypsy scene, which is omitted from this movie), and almost all of the dialogue is straight from the book.  I'll have to re-read the book and re-watch that adaptation of it to purge this movie from my memory!"
4710,767020294,1,"I am so disappointed that they made my timeless book into this crappy movie.  If I knew they would make this bad of a movie out of my book, I would not have written it!  This was the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre EVER!!!!!  There was NO chemistry between Jane and Mr. Edwards.  It was painful to watch them kiss, I'm not kidding!  The only good actress in the whole movie was Gemma Jones who plays Mrs. Fairfax and is from Sense and Sensibility.  It is definetly a made for TV movie, and should have never been made into a DVD...if you prefer watching made for TV movies then you'll like it.  I recommend either the 1996 version or the 1944 version with Elizabeth Taylor as Helen.  This version misses all the important parts, quickly runs through her childhood, and skips her Aunt's death.  There is no emotion in this movie and it has no suspense at all.  Trust me, don't rent or watch it!!  I hope this was helpful."
4711,767020294,5,"This production on A&E was my introduction to the greatest actress I've ever seen, the incandescent, fearless, intense and radiant Samantha Morton.  At that time, her Jane Eyre was the greatest performance by an actress I'd ever seen -- and I'm fairly savvy and discriminating, Peggy Ashcroft being the greatest I'd ever seen till I saw this tv film.  Many of the reviewers here seem to miss the point.  It doesn't matter whether the script is a scrupulous adaptation or not, or whether this actress is too plain, too pretty, or even if her interpretation doesn't match the picture of this famous literary heroine which you've got in your head.  The point is her incomparable performance -- what Shakespeare called ""the thing itself.""  Her greatest gift, among so many, is her seemingly effortless capacity, quietly and with extraordinary discipline and restraint in one so young (18 or 19 at the time), to break our hearts.  There's no one with comparable power and it is her gift to us, ""a largesse universal, like the sun.""  How Shakespeare would have loved her."
4712,767020294,1,"I really disliked this version of Jane Eyre, so much so that I found myself skipping parts and pulling the movie out before finishing it. I infinitely prefer the William Hurt adaptation of the novel.

First off, the film quality and color of this film were very poor. It was washed out and altogether too bland. Also, the acting was poor in my opinion. Samantha Morton was not very believable as Jane Eyre and the actor who plays Mr. Rochester was altogether unappealing. The two actors had no spark or chemistry to speak of, and the relation of love by Mr. Rochester later in the film is wholly unbelievable and poorly delivered. He ruins one of the best lines in the novel (the one with the bit of string tied to his heart and Jane's). Also, although Mr. Rochester is not handsome, this actor was just uglier than I had imagined Mr. Rochester to be. But, that would be of little account if he also did not portray Mr. Rochester as just plain rude. He ordered about Jane in a brutish manner, levied insults, barked out his lines and was very dull. Why Jane would be attracted to him (beyond being lonely and not having the company of any other man) is beyond me. The portryal of Jane was also a dull one and her constant voice overs were really annoying. A film is supposed to show us the story, not tell us the story. There was far too much telling of Jane felt or about her past, and far too little demonstration. I was told Jane loved Mr. Rochester, but from watching the film I found that very hard to believe. Jane also seemed to be rude and disrespectful on purpose, rather than observant and forthright as she is in the novel. She doesn't mean to offend, but truthfully answers questions and speaks her mind. The movie would have you think she is just catty. Also, she always looks so annoyed with Mr. Rochester.

Overall, I regret buying this film. I wished I put my $5 dollars towards the William Hurt adaptation which more accurately captures the emotion and spirit of the novel, if not all the exact details."
4713,767020294,1,"This version of Jane Eyre is absolutely disappointing.  It is not faithful to the novel and the acting is horrible.  There is no chemistry between Samantha Morton and Ciran Hinds and the emotions they supposedly ""tried"" to embody are so watered down that it is just embarrassing.  The best version of Jane Eyre is the one with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton.  Do not waste you time and money on this.  Not recommended at all !"
4714,767087372,5,The quality of the DVD is excellent.
4715,767087372,5,I missed a lot of the series when it was on PBS.  So this was my popcorn and quiet time.  Laughter and tears.
4716,767087372,5,Hasn't aged much. Just as wonderful now as in 1971!
4717,767087372,5,"loved it.  Missed it the first time around, and was hobbled by a bad hip.  the early scenes are akin to the ""honeymooners"" in graphics, but the series develops nicely and is addicting."
4718,767087372,5,Wonderful!!  I haven't seen it all but very good stuff.
4719,767087372,5,Watched this series while recovering from foot surgery and loved it. A great series and I was sorry to have it end.
4720,767087372,5,"I saw this series years ago on PBS and recently bought the set for a gift. Have heard from them that they, too, are enjoying this series. I think it is one of the best that PBS ever aired."
4721,767087372,5,"My wife and watched this around the time we got married, it's nice to have it around again. Price was pretty good at the time we bought it (May 2015)"
4722,767087372,1,"No, it was NOT the full collection and we plan to return it."
4723,767020294,2,"When the screenwriters adapted Robert Stevenson's ""Jane Eyre"" movie, they had to leave everything out that couldn't be condensed.  The mini-series approach, however, allows ample time to study the characters in depth. In my 29 years, I recall not one, but *two* BBC TV mini-series adaptations of Jane Eyre that played in the early 1980s.  These attempted to portray the book as a complete experience.  I won't judge which of the two is more definitive, having only read part of the book.

The 1983 one, released to VHS/DVD, starred Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. Some reviewers have commented on how well Sian Pattenden portrays young Jane, mistreated by her aunt Reed's family and at Lowood school. This is the first hour of the series, and I was riveted. When Jane is grown and Rochester arrives, Clarke and Dalton do the work justice - they're just not as much fun to watch as their counterparts in the 1973 mini-series.

The 1973 series starred Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack. The series is excellent, almost to the point where I'd call it treachery that it's not available either on VHS or DVD. This was no minor production: in fact, it played in the States on PBS up to ten years after its original broadcast.

Dalton's Rochester seemed at times too leaden and serious, almost a caricature. It's probably not necessary to blow this aspect of Rochester out of proportion. Jayston plays Rochester as a bitter man with a secret thorn in his side, but balances sardonic wit with what's been called a ""poetic imagination."" Check this out when Rochester is explaining his secret to Jane.  You may find Jayston on record as saying that Rochester was his favorite television role. His enthusiasm for the part is obvious. Clarke's Jane is plain, and seeks independence, love and servitude, but it's a little harder to see where the fire in Jane Eyre comes from. It's not so much Clarke was a bit too good-looking, although that may be. Cusack, an Irish actress, is irresistable in more ways than one.  A governess who must mind her boundaries as a subordinate, she converses on would-be equal terms with Rochester, trading jabs, despite the difference in age and experience.  Thus, in the early scenes, we get a good sense of Jane Eyre's spiritedness (even though we might not have seen the part about her childhood). The interaction of Dalton and Clarke, while fine, falls short of some of these bonus characteristics.

Other things to note: the first episode of the 5-part 1973 series was seldom shown outside of the UK.  The memorable theme music was the passionate ""Introduction and Allegro"" composed by one of Britain's greatest, Sir Edward Elgar.  My approbation goes to the director Joan Craft, the screenwriter, Robin Chapman, and to the cast:  Megs Jenkins (Mrs. Fairfax), Stephanie Beacham (Blanche Ingram), Geoffrey Whitehead (St. John Rivers), Susan Brodrick (Mary Rivers), Caroline Harris (Diana Rivers), Edward De Souza (Richard Mason), and the rest.

It's unfortunate that few people will have the opportunity to see both series to compare them. ""Jane Eyre"" is a classic novel. Many different adaptations of it are currently for sale. In fact, it appears some extremely poor adaptations of it are for sale, now. Even uncharitable people must acknowledge the 1973 version of ""Jane Eyre"" is not ""bad,"" and had a good run before the BBC decided to produce a new series for 1983.

If you write to the powers-that-be, BBC America or BBC Worldwide, they'd be able to estimate the market potential of a video release. Go ahead and give it a try. Both mini-series are good television productions and should be distributed.

There is a website dedicated to the 1973 series that can be easily found.  Look online also for an image of the Radio Times cover that announced the original broadcast."
4724,767020294,5,I rented this dvd and loved it so much that i bought it the next day here on Amazon.  I loved the chemistry and passion between Jane and Mr. Rochester.  You must see this version! I also look forward to seeing the Timothy Dalton version that i have heard good things about.
4725,767020294,4,"Cirian Hinds resonates with the dark, seething energy which is Mr. Rochester.  His portrayal is fantastic!  Samantha Morton is a fairly good Jane, and definitely meets the physical expectations of the small, plain governess.  This version is a good attempt at capturing the beautiful relationship shared by Jane and Mr. Rochester, but falls short, mainly I think due to time constraints.  It is impossible to cram all the plot development, intense dialogue and stirring emotion of this book into a 2 hour movie.  If you are wanting a more faithful portrayal of the book, check out the version with Timothy Dalton.  The Cirian Hinds/Samantha Morton version lacks in plot and character development, but is a valiant attempt at capturing the essence of the classic book."
4726,767020294,3,"With two such fine performers as Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton, and with Charlotte Bronte's masterful story, I could not believe that this version of Jane Eyre would be anything but enjoyable.  Sadly, I was disappointed.  I think the problem lies with the screenplay. A complex story was reduced to 2 hours, which meant that key plot and character development had to be sacrificed.  Hinds and Morton just did not have enough to work with.  Stick with the Timothy Dalton version, it is far better."
4727,767020294,5,"Wonderful. I loved the book since I was a child and when i saw version of Jane Eyre with Timothy Dalton, I didn't think anything could top that. However, this one is fabulous as well. Ciaran Hinds is perfect as Mr. Rochester. After seeing this movie I became a big fan of his. If you like good love stories this is a must see."
4728,767020294,4,"I can't say that this version of Jane Eyre followed the storyline closely.  Because of time constraints, large chunks of the novel had to be cut out or streamlined.  This includes not only some key plot points, but a lot of the best dialogue between Jane and Mr. Rochester as their relationship develops.

That said, I still think this is an enjoyable film, so long as you enjoy it in its own right and don't compare it to the book.  Both Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton commit to their roles with passion.  Like the characters in the novel, neither is conventionally beautiful; they are riveting because of the emotional force they bring to their parts.  At times, Hinds was a little too gruff as Rochester, but it never went over the top; he looked the part of Mr. Rochester and in my opinion acted it incredibly well.  And Samantha Morton is luminous - she may wear plain clothing and sport a ridiculous hair style, but she shines.  I did dislike some of the belabored dialogue the screenwriters introduced though."
4729,767020294,2,"As a huge fan of the novel, I was very excited to try and find a film that would do it justice.  I had read the amazon.com reviews of this particular version, and in spite of some severely negative opinions, I decided to give it a try anyhow.
Well, let me just say to those with the poor reviews: ""I concur!!""
The child actors who play young jane and young Adele are not good at all.  Additionally, the character Adele - who is SUPPOSED to be 10 - looks to be at least 12 year old!  It was ridiculous.
Samantha Morton who portrays our heroine, Jane, does an fair job in the role.  She could have been a bit less attractive...yes, that's right, folks, just because a woman doesn't wear make-up and have a fancy hair-do doesn't necessarily make her unattractive!  Her portrayal of Jane was a little too impertenant.  Yes, Jane had spirit and professed her opinions honestly when asked, but the adult Jane was not openly confrontational and defiant in the way she was sometimes acted in this movie.  Her character was not done justice.
Cirian Hinds physically was a good Mr. Rochester, in my opinion.  He looked the part of the unattractive - even could be called ugly by some - large boned, tall man.  (I have seen him in ""Persuasion"" where is is the dashing Captain Wentworth, and looked purty darn hot I might add!  so kudos to his transforamation!) But it is a pity the likeness should end there.  He was made far too mean.  I don't remember him ever actually SCREAMING at Jane in the novel, yet he does it here frequently.  In the scene where they first meet, and Jane startles his horse, causing him to fall (they changed the setting and dialogue greatly in this scene by the way), he begins to scream at Jane, demanding and insisting she help him although she declines.
Isn't this a bit backwards?  Was Jane not the one insisting upon helping Mr. Rochester in the book??!
Anyhow, Mr. Rochester is a gruff, unpolished man towards her in the book, but they take it to extremes in the movie.  He is downright, plain old mean.
Additionally, his feelings towards Adele are much different than they are supposed to be.  In the book, of course, he is resentful of her presence and greatly irked by her.  He sends her away at every opportunity and never bestows her any real affection.  In the movie though, they have him asking for her, calling her to him, even setting her in his lap!  And, remember, this girl they have playing the supposed 10 year old Adele is more like 12 or 13!!  This makes for a fairly disturbing moment in itself!
They whiz through Jane's childhood with fair accuracy.  Condensing her childhood to being locked in the ""red room"" then being shipped away to school to face typhus.  It takes all of about 10 minutes for her to become 18 and leave to pursue her govenerss position.  Everything flies by you.  There are several scenes added in that are not in the book, but for the most part, it is done to provide the viewer background to better understand what is happening and why.  These scenes are basically dialogue between secondary charcters.
There is a scene where Mr. Rochester takes Jane into town to shop for the wedding clothes, and the run into Blanche Ingram.  That is the strangest addition - completely unnecessary, in my view!
Anyhow, after the wedding is called off, and Jane resigns to leave Thornfield, there is about 10 minutes of completely made-up dialogue between Jane and Mr. Rochester.  He does, in the end, actually start screaming at her!  He screams at her to leave!
Never - not in a million years! - would Mr. Rochester EVER tell Jane to leave!!  He even throws her bag after her!
They once again whiz through her three days of homeless wandering and begging, and her year spent with the Rivers's.  They completely leave out Maria Rivers's character altogether, and St. John is made a gregarious, pleasant, happy soul who smiles as he kindly asks Jane to marry him.  They pack all this into about 5 minutes.
She rushes back to Mr. Rochester after hearing him call to her on the wind, and about five minutes later it's all over, folks.
As far as some critizism of Mr. Rochester's healthy appearence at this point in the film (other than his blindness and mangled left hand - which was SUPPOSED to be gone altogether!), the book specifically notes Mr. Rochester is physically as strong and robust as he ever was.  Only his ""countenance"" has changed.  He is brooding and sad.  But physically, he is still strong and healthy looking. He is not supposed to look withered, sickly, and weak.  In that part, they again do Mr. Rochester physical justice.
In conclusion, the film may have been better had it been longer.  If they had more time to devote to the development of story lines, etc.  My other HUGE gripe is that they used SO LITTLE of Bronte's actual dialogue!!!  WHY???
AND they left out some VERY important scenes!
Just one example the springs to mind is the scene when Mr. Rochester is proposing to Jane.  So romantic, so climactic!  And yet, they not only use hardly ANY of the real dialogue, but the tree - the chestnut tree - is not struck by lightening!  HELLO!!  I'm not literature major here, but isn't that a prime example of what is called, 'foreshadowing'??  An indication of things to come?
They messed up one of the most romantic and climactic scenes in the entire book.
So, it's too short, hardly any dialogue is used, they change things that should not be changed, and add so many things that should not be added!
They have changed the characters' personalities and it has been for the worse.  They took EXTREME artistic license in making this movie, and I DO NOT like it one bit!!
It's not even a good movie in itself.  Even if you have never read the book or even heard of it...the way they rush through it all would leave a viewer completely confused.  I was constantly having to explain to my husband what was happening and why.
Anyhow, I am not recommending it!"
4730,767020294,5,"This is my favorite book of all time.  I have seen several versions of the movie, and although some of the details from the book are missing, this is the best version out there.  Cirian Hinds and Samantha Morton are just fabulous in their portrayals.  If you liked the book, this is the movie version that you will enjoy most of all."
4731,767020294,1,"If you've seen the 1983 version on VHS with Timothy Dalton as Rochester (or read the book), you will be very disappointed with this version.  Several crucial parts of the story are left out completely, such as Jane learning that she has been left a sizeable inheritance. Also, Rochester is overacted, and the growth of the relationship between he and Jane is unconvincing.  I bought this because it was on DVD, and wish I hadn't.  I'll wait for the 1983 version to be put on DVD."
4732,767020294,5,What an excellent movie! It brought me to tears.
4733,767087372,5,"From start to finish this series is brilliant,your family will sit with you every night from start to finish...."
4734,767087372,5,Great
4735,767087372,5,"What can I say, this show is not only deep and well acted, but it really captures the change in social order before and after WWI."
4736,767087372,5,My wife and I fully enjoyed the series. Sent promptly as well.
4737,767087372,5,Absolutely love this series.  Planning on taking a day and watching on the DVD's in a Upstairs/Downstairs marathon.
4738,767087372,3,"Started off slowly but with more location shots getting better.  It gets confusing sometimes because  the same writer does not write all the episodes - same for the director - it breaks up the continuity,  But, I missed this series when it was first broadcast and so enjoying it now  - a little better with each season."
4739,767087372,5,Well worth it!
4740,767087372,5,"Wonderful; unique, well-acted, interesting, well-written, well-directed, creative, superb character development. Holds up so well considering how old it is now.  I would not have discovered it if I had not grown addicted to DOWNTON ABBEY.  This is just as good and while in some respects similar, in other quite different. Each episode can be watched as a separate story more than DOWNTON ABBEY episodes can, and this one seems more political to me.  Those who like DOWNTON ABBEY will probably be fans of this as well, though.  My husband gave this to me as a birthday gift after I mentioned wanting to watch it now.  I'm glad he did, as it exceeds my expectations."
4741,767087372,5,great series
4742,767087372,1,"After watching three episodes we sent it back for a refund.  The quaiity of sound was not good, the scripts were boring, and the actors had very little apeal this is comparing it with Downton Abby.  I would not reccomend it to anyone.  It had thhe flavor of people acting in a school play."
4743,767020294,2,"Cirian Hinds and Samantha Morton are wonderful actors, but why didn't the screenwriters even glance at Charlotte Bronte's book when they wrote this screenplay?  It was a very strange experience to see some of my favorite characters of literature saying and doing things that weren't even remotely connected to the story.  Rochester screaming at Jane to leave Thornfield?  Jane and Rochester shopping downtown for wedding clothes and ""bumping into"" Blanche Ingram?  I don't think so! Not only did the screenwriters make up entirely new scenes, the dialogue in familiar scenes was often totally unrecognizable.  I watch film adaptations to see my favorite characters and scenes fleshed out, not given a major overhaul.
Two things they got right -- the age difference and chemistry between Rochester and Jane (although Samantha Morton is too pretty.  Come on!  She can't be pretty Harriet Smith in the A&E version of ""Emma"" and plain-Jane Eyre in this movie!)  If you just like to watch good acting, you might like this.  But if you, like me, are a fan of the book, this is a very jolting and unpleasant ride."
4744,767020294,3,"I wish someone could comment on the picture quality of the DVD.  I have purchased about 20 DVD movies and rented countless more, and I thought all of them looked just fine.  This is the first one I have come across whose picture resolution/sharpness resembles that of a slightly worn-out VHS tape.
As for the movie, Samantha Morton was a wonderful Jane Eyre and Ciaran Hinds was a pretty good Mr. Rochester. Knowing what I know now about the DVD, I might still have bought it because I love this version of Jane Eyre and don't have it on videotape."
4745,767020294,1,"The screenwriting for this particular adaptation took extreme liberties, not with the events (which is to be expected) but the characterization of both Jane and Mr. Rochester. I assume the liberties were taken in order to make the characters more palatable to modern tastes and philosophies. A pity the writer could not trust the original material to convey the story."
4746,767020294,5,"Heart-wrenching and heart felt!  A wonderful way to expose someone to the classics  -- after seeing this, you want to read the book.  Ciaran Hinds was awesome -- I love his portrayal of Mr. Rochester, especially the emotion line towards the end of the movie -- ""Jane, my heart will burst for want to see your face.""  Beautiful!"
4747,767020294,5,"After a rough childhood Jane Eyre wanted a change of scenery. So with much determination that she had. She became a governess to The Master of Thornfield, Mr. Rochester's daughter. She soon falls in love for her Employer. Still her feeling grew on for him by each time they talked. Her heart finally became opened to his kindness.  Jane won Mr. Rochester's heart, than when the past finds him out, he has to deal with them. Jane was tourn from the deepest love she could ever have, and went away until Mr. Rochester dealt with his problems.  Leaving was the hardest thing she could do to him. A Great DVD to have in anyone collections."
4748,767020294,4,"THIS A&E VERSION OF JANE EYRE IS EXCELLENT.  THE STORYLINE IS TRUE TO THE NOVEL, THOUGH ABBREVIATED.  HINDS AS ROCHESTER IS AS GOOD AS ORSON WELLES, THOUGH NOT QUITE UP TO TIMOTHY DALTON'S PERFORMANCE.  SAMANTHA MORTON IS WONDERFUL AS JANE EYRE, AT TIMES SURPASSING ZELAH CLARKE, WHO WAS NEARLY THE PERFECT JANE EYRE, AND JOAN FONTAINE, WHOSE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS ALONE WERE SUFFICIENT TELL THE STORY.  IN SAMANTHA MORTON WE SEE THE YOUTH AND NAIVET OF JANE, AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPING PASSION AND INNER STRENGTH.  THIS VERSION TELLS THE STORY MORE COMPLETELY AND ACCURATELY THAN THE HOLLYWOOD CLASSIC, AND TELLS IT AS WELL, BUT IS NOT QUITE THE EQUAL OF THE PRODUCTION FEATURING TIMOTHY DALTON AND ZELAH CLARKE."
4749,767020294,3,"I recently caught this on cable and was excited to see it; after all, ""Jane Eyre"" is one of my favorite books of all time.
While Samantha Morton made an excellent Jane, I thought Ciaran Hinds was terrible as Mr. Rochester. He was far more blustery than smoldering, and the scene at which he screamed at Jane while she drove away disturbed me. He seemed more like an abusive boyfriend than a man overwhelmed with pain and passion.
Also, some of my favorite scenes were cut. Where was the scene where Jane went home to visit her family? She left and then came back again; we saw no part of her interaction with the Reeds, which was one of the best parts in the book. She also never learned of the inheritance left to her by her uncle in Madeira. And I agree with the reviewer who said that the part with St. John and Diana might have been left out for all the weight this movie gave it.
Overall, this is not an awful movie. However, it is inferior by far to other productions, notably the version with Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt."
4750,767020294,1,"When I found out that A&E had come out with a movie version of my favorite book I was overjoyed. I enjoyed their versions of Pride and Prejudice and Emma. I was very dissapointed in their production of Jane Eyre. Key scenes were either altered, removed, or just poorly done. The entire gypsy scene was gone. How this major scene could possibly been taken out with thoughts that it would not be missed is beyond me.
This was a wonderful book but a bad movie when the two are compared. If you have not read the book then maybe you won't care about the ""alterations"", but I promise you that this is one of the greatest books ever written and will not be dissapointed by investing the extra time and effort of actually picking up a copy and reading it."
4751,767087372,5,"My favorite TV series.  I've seen the whole series three or four times and I plan to watch it again. I can't say enough good things about it.  For me, the stories have more of a connection to the history of the times than Downton Abbey, where the characters seem to exist in their own protective bubble, oblivious of what's going on around them."
4752,767087372,5,Arrived on time as always. Nice package DVD's are each in plastic flip folders. Great old BBC drama show(as stated in other reviews it is a poor mans Downton Abbey)but still excellent show for the day.
4753,767087372,5,"SUCH A CLASSIC.  GREAT TO HAVE ON WHILE WORKING.  IT IS MOSTLY ABOUT THE DIALOGUE, NOT THE VISUALS, ANYWAY."
4754,767087372,5,"I purchased this for my better half and she loves it.  I am not a fan of Edwardian stories, but this is quite enjoyable."
4755,767087372,5,great series...love the era that it takes place in!! great actors !!
4756,767087372,4,"Very good. I wished we had watched when it first aired.
Enjoyed watching."
4757,767087372,5,Well pleased with purchase
4758,767087372,5,It's Great
4759,767087372,5,After Downton abbey it was nice to see what was its predecessor . Just don't expect fast moving drama.
4760,767087372,5,This is a wonderful series and I hated to see it end!  Really gives a historical view of what early English high society was like with their hired help.  You really become attached to the characters.  Enjoy!
4761,767020294,4,"Yes, I've read Jane Eyre, for the first time when I was twelve.  And, yes, I liked the book.  But this movie isn't the book and I liked it as well.
One thing the movie did very well in the beginning was to condense years of abuse by Jane's aunt and Mr. Brocklehurst into a few key horrific scenes that also point out the affection that Jane felt for her friend Helen, the few kind teachers and later her pupils.
Ciaran Hinds as the hero begins with a great deal of roaring and bluster, but here and there are hints that this is a screen he uses to protect himself from the pain of intimacy.  The key to Mr. Rochester's character is in the scene in which he tells Jane about his ""grand passion"" and how he was betrayed by the woman he adored.  Juxtapose this against the first Mrs. Rochester's passion for him that overset her reason.
Samantha Morton does a lovely job of portraying an innocent who is not ignorant of the darker aspects of human nature-- Lowood School taught her more than reading, writing and geography.  Her plummet into the pain of the truth and then her coming to understand the power of the passion that grips her is very well played.
If I want to re-experience my version of Jane Eyre I will reread the book.  That does not mean I cannot enjoy another interpretation of the story."
4762,767020294,2,"I must fervently disagree with the many positive reviews shown here, for 2 major reasons.  First, the writers took great 'liberties' with the novel that detract, rather than enhance, the characters.  The best two examples involve the main characters of Mr. Rochester and Jane.  In the book, Rochester is a brooding, singular figure who is very much a victim of the cruel plotting and vices of others.  But in this film version, he is cruel and vindictive in and of himself.  Vengeful, plotting, and profane, you have little reason to see why Jane would ever attach herself to such a worthless creature.  Jane of course does fall in love with him, but because he is so repugnant, the viewer can hardly see any reason why.  Thus, Jane is herself reduced greatly from a woman who loves unconditionally - -as was shown in the book- -to a strange, misguided young woman racked with a codependent psyche.  The second area in which this version is inferior to the book, and the other far superior film versions (particularly the William Hurt version) is its brevity.  It is only 90 minutes long.  It leaves out so many of the small aspects that would normally give vitality and life to the characters.  Being that it is such a poor version, this is not necessarily all that bad, but willing to give the film chance after chance to redeem itself, it falls terribly short on nearly every measure."
4763,767020294,3,"Jane Eyre is my absolute fav book, but I thought this make of the book was WAY too melodramatic. I don't believe the portrayal of Mr. Rochester was all that great in this movie. He was really melodramatic. This movie also skips A LOT of scenes from the book that I really enjoyed. This movie just wasn't all that great. The book is always great though! I've read it countless times and never get tired of it."
4764,767020294,2,"While this production is worth renting, it is not faithful to the book because of its omissions, and I found Ciaran Hinds to be a very unsatisfactory Mr. Rochester.  The script highlighted his unsavory features (he is a deceiving adulterer, after all) to such an extent that his romantic and heroic qualities were insufficient to overcome the detriment to his character and likeability.  In the book, his evil deeds are swept away by the force of his personality and the depth of his love.  I also felt that while Timothy Dalton looked too young in the part, Ciaran Hinds looked too old and a bit worse for wear.  The Timothy Dalton version is the most satisfying in terms of completion of plot.  It is indeed straight from the book, as someone noted, and what a book it is!  I think it takes quite some nerve to edit Charlotte Bronte to this extent."
4765,767020294,2,"Jane Eyre is one of my very favorite books, so I simply cannot like a film version that leaves out important details.  I liked it when I first saw it, but had the nagging feeling that something was missing.  So I re-read the book, and discovered exactly what was missing -- about 1/4 of the book.  Among the scenes that were missing were the other reasons behind Jane's return to Thornfield.
And then there's Samantha Morton.  I cannot think of a film where I liked her, so that is another strike against this version.
Some have said that Timothy Dalton is ""too handsome"" to play Rochester.  Perhaps he is.  But he is such an incredible actor that I will forgive him. *grin*  I do appreciate Ciaran Hinds, and it pains me to say that I did not like him as Rochester. I read someplace that he hadn't read the book before making this film.  Well, it shows.  He rants and raves too much; there was no subtlety in his performance.  And subtlety is something Dalton understood in his performance.
An adaptation does not need to be a word-for-word translation from page to screen, but it does have to retain the spirit of the original for me to appreciate it, and this version does neither, so I cannot find much to like about it."
4766,767020294,1,"Yes, there were a couple parts of this movie that were good, but after reading the book I believe they'll never come close to how Charlotte Bronte would have wanted it.  1. Why was little Jane smiling in the ""Red Room"" scene?  2. Miss Ingram was not that pretty.  3. Jane appeared quite snotty to Mr. Rochester in the beginning.  4.  It didn't show a gradual enough transition from ""Master and governess"" to ""in love"", and they might as well have skipped the whole part on St. John and his family for the insignificance it seemed to the whole movie.  Instead, they could have NOT skipped the scene where Mr. Rochester disguises himself as a gypsy (or whatever you call it.)  Overall I was very disappointed but then it could have been that the whole time I was comparing it to the BOOK and how much more heart-wrenching the book was!  I probably would have liked it more had I seen it first before the book.  I recommend renting this BEFORE buying!"
4767,767020294,1,"This adaptation of the marvelous novel ""Jane Eyre"" was an absolute punishment to watch. Such artistic liberties were taken with the characters in this film as to render them virtually unrecognizable. I can't recall any of the dialogue that was actually true to the book, and this was very disappointing as the strength of the story lies in the voices of the characters. I have no doubt that Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds would have done a marvelous job in their roles, were it not for the horrid writing and equally horrid direction. Mr. Rochester is so continually flying into a rage over something or other, that one wonders how Jane ever could have tolerated his company. And Jane speaks her mind in a much more opinionated and argumentative way then Charlotte Bronte ever allowed her to in the book. I also wonder why some of the most important scenes were completely ignored. Basically all of Jane's childhood is passed over in about 5 minutes, and thus the foundation of Jane's character cannot be truly understood. Also, the deathbed scene of Aunt Reed, and all the particulars of that family were passed over. And the scene where Mr. Rochester disguises himself as a gypsy, one of the most revealing and pivotal scenes in the story, was completely excluded. I would not recommend this film to anyone who has never read the book, as it simply does not do it justice. I also would not recommend it to any true lovers of this tale, as it is more likely to frustrate than to entertain."
4768,767020294,4,"Well, I  just watched this movie today again after not seeing it for a couple of years and again I loved it.
No, it is not as true to the book as some other versions, but it captures the spirit and tells the story in a very compelling, moving-it-along way. I enjoyed the rapid transitions, cut-aways and voice overs. It tells the story of the novel in a most interesting way.
I think Samantha Morton makes an excellent Jane Eyre. She really captures Jane's innocent yet vibrantly alive spirit. Morton exudes the very fairy-like, impish qualities that Mr. Rochester is always describing her as having in the book. I think she is the best Jane I have see portrayed although I do enjoy Charlotte Gainesborough's and Joan Fontaine's work as Jane as well.
Ciran Hinds did equally as well. I think the two actors really displayed the chemistry that existed potently between Jane and Rochester. This kiss under the tree was remarkable!
The settings and lighting in this version are much better than in the 1983 Timothy Dalton version. And although Hinds is quite handsome in Persuasion, he actually becomes the more unattractive Rochester in this movie. Dalton, although a powerful performance in the miniseries in which he played Mr. Rochester, could never really be considered ""ugly."" Hinds is a more credible Rochester and very true to Charlotte Bronte's novel.
I highly recommend and enjoy this version of Jane Eyre. Although not as true to the book as other versions, I think it included the most crucial scenes in a most convincing way. It was truly a fresh look at a classic and timeless novel."
4769,767020294,3,"I haven't seen this movie, but I have read the book. I'd just like to say, for those who complain that Jane wasn't ""beautiful"" in the movie and those that say ""How could Rochester fall in love with her?"", that Bronte's whole point was that neither Jane nor Rochester were beautiful. Both were plain and some could say that Rochester was even ugly. The point is that their love was based on something higher and less superficial than beauty alone. Those who think that you have to be beautiful for someone to love you are just downright shallow."
4770,767087372,5,great
4771,767087372,5,"Our family thinks Upstairs Downstairs is better than its look-alike Downton Abbey.  Not quite so soap-operaish (is there such a word?) but
we like them both."
4772,767087372,5,"Great DVD.  Excellent product, shipping, and packaging."
4773,767087372,5,Very satisfied with the quality of the video on these DVDs.  Be aware that some of the video in the first season are in black and white due to a technicians strike when these were originally filmed.
4774,767087372,5,Great. I will watch it more than once!
4775,767087372,4,It is a nice series but my husband won't watch it with me. To each his own...
4776,767087372,2,Got a little bored with it
4777,767087372,5,"When I finally caught up with this set, I was rather late to the party, I guess.
A well-known retailer had packaged only 3 discs and sold them as a complete
version. Beware.  It can be difficult to find a ""Fourth Season"" available as a
single purchase."
4778,767087372,5,"Love, love, love this series"
4779,767087372,5,nce buy
4780,767020294,2,"I've read the book (10 times) and seen all the movie versions.  The ""Jane"" in this video was unbelievably haughty and unattractive.  How in the world did Rochester ever fall in love with her?  When they kiss in the movie there is the ""chemistry"" (mentioned in other reviews), but lust isn't what the book is all about.  All my favorite passages were cut out or adulterated beyond recognition.  This would be a terrific disappointment to any one who really loves the book."
4781,767020294,4,"A notion that a movie should be true to its literary predecessor is often unnecessarily emphasized. Some degree of creative freedom should be tolerated, especially if the result is as moving as this one. The omission of some significant points does not bother me, because the core of the interplay between the two main characters is sustained. The film doesn't deal with the heroine's spiritual developement; it is concentrated upon one, albeit the most important, aspect - her relationship with Rochester, and in that respect it is extremely successful. Chemistry between the leading actors is undeniable, and the developement of their characters' mutual affection is smooth, easy and beliveable, although it takes place within only a couple of scenes. Morton is a personification of the literary Jane - reserved yet emotional, insecure but brave. She makes her 'small Quaker-like' heroine as 'plain' as she possibly could. Since many of Charlotte's allusions to Jane's independence were omitted, it was necessary to make her more outspoken so that her true nature could be perceived. In the 'first-encounter scene' literary Jane is more assertive and thus sets the tone for her future relationship with Rochester. This blunder is remedied soon afterwards as the characters' verbal intercourse becomes more spicy and direct. Mistical connotations in the aforementioned filmed scene follow the surrealism of the novel, otherwise almost completely overlooked in the film. Hinds is a true Rochester, both physically and spiritually. He dominates the screen with his powerful personality: the original character is not at all handsome, he's often emotionally abusive, but still manages to be fascinatingly charismatic and sexually desireable. Hinds is a perfect image of a dangerous, romantic, imposing Byronic 'doomed hero', a rake eventually tamed and redeemed by marital love. Furtermore, this Rochester is even more understanding than his literary counterpart in relation to his mad, imprisoned wife. Regrettably, Blanche Ingram is (again!) blond and sophisticated, while she is supposed to be 'dark and majestic' - a beauty prototype which should remind us of Bertha Mason's former self. I welcome the omission of the gipsy scene; it is, after all, Charlotte's overly romantic and highly unbelievable diversion. The kiss, on the other hand, is a major disappointment - in this modernized and not at all timid version this climactic profession of love should have been rendered more realistically. It would have been the perfect icing on this romantic cake."
4782,767020294,1,"I have seen every version of Jane Eyre that has been produced, and there have been many versions. This 1997 cinematic production is so far off the mark that it shouldn't even receive a single star. I don't know why anyone would like this movie at all. If you have seen any of the other versions, you would automatically find this the absolute worst. If you read the novel, you would find this version offensive, and certainly a slap in the face to Charlotte Bronte. The acting is foul and gross in nature, the plot line is disjointed and patchy, the dialogue is laughable and all together wrong. If you want a good production, get either the Welles version (well done) or the BBC version starring Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke (my personal favorite), but from this production flee now and flee far. However, I do have one good thing to say about this movie.  I teach Jane Eyre (the novel) at the High School level.  I have found that this version is useful for showing students just how far off a film production can be in comparison with the novel.  When I showed a clip of this version to my students after having them read chapter 12 (R-- falls off horse), the students began shaking with convulsive laughter, followed by a hailstorm of derisive remarks that peaked into a cumulative ""that's not how it is in the novel--that's awful!"""
4783,767020294,5,"i went searching round for more ciaran hinds films after stumbling on the wonderful gem that is persuasion
so initailly i was dumb struck at the relative ugliness of mr hinds in this role as mr rochester. i liked the film...loved jane at the first viewing, could absolutely see the character as real....but i was left glimpsing for those beautiful moments with ciaran hinds.
 i then went back to the book and realsied just how often jane, in serious comment and in jest refers to him as ugly.....and came to the conclusion that this book is in essence(please excuse me avid bronte fans) beauty and the beast.
seen in this light ciaran plays the character and visual sense of mr rochester perfectly in my opinion.
the more you watch the film, the more you are drawn into their journey and the depth of their character and passion.
 i found myself only actually wanting to see the scenes with samantha morton and ciaran hinds interacting, and although i appreciate the loss of some of the plot, they would all have been scenes that frankly i would probably have fast forwarded through after the first couple of viewings.
i think there was an element of speed to the making of this production....it was made for tv not a big budget movie....but i will never forget the scene where jane returns to mr rochester, and as the film drove me to re read the book anyway i feel like i got the best of both worlds.
it took my breath away, and if not definitive it is certainly addictive."
4784,767020294,3,"I am a firm believer that one should not judge a movie too harshly based on the book from which it came.  I fully understand that it is very difficult to fit a 400 page book into a 2-hour slot.  Plot adjustments will always have to be made.  One thing that I cannot stand, however, is misrepresentation of characters.  While this version (A&E's) of ""Jane Eyre"" sticks to the basic plot, much better than the William Hurt version does, the screenwriters got the characters all wrong.  In this version, Jane is much too forceful; she never would have spoken rudely to her employer as she does in this movie.  She could barely look him in the eye, much less call him a liar to his face, as she basically does.
After seeing A&E's ""Pride and Prejudice,"" which was absolutley wonderful, I really would have expected more from them.  Shame on you, A&E!"
4785,767020294,1,"I am a Jane Eyre fanatic, so it is with experience that I can say. . . this movie is not worth the time. I own the BBC and 1997 verse and those are the only two I could ever recommend(the BBC verse is the best). There is NOTHING about Mr Rochester's character that is appealing. In fact, they make him far to angry and unpleasent than he should be. The book portrays a broken man. For that reason, women are drawn to him. Not even in the most climaxtic scene am I convinced that he is truely in need of love. The whole movie felt cold and unfeeling!"
4786,767020294,3,"I chose this version to see the portrayal of Mr Rochester by Mr Hinds & in that I was pleased. I think Mr Hinds did an excellent job despite all the shouting and there were several times in the film when he was able to bring out Mr Rochester's more tender side & this all seemed to work well for the character. I was very disappointed in the way Jane seemed unable, for all her passionate words to actually kiss the man. I have seen Samantha Morton in other films & have liked her work immensely. In much of the dialog she shows true passion in her speaking but it seems that she could never really bring herself to kiss Mr Rochester on the lips, cheek-yes, lips-no, not really. If they weren't meant to kiss then the film could have done without the close-up camera views that made this so obvious to me. It seemed, to me, that a real kiss was avoided at every embrace. Even near the end of the movie when they were reunited with no impediments between them, professing their undying love, there was not one real kiss. The book was not portrayed true to form which so often happens when novels are made into movies but if you are going to film a passionate embrace & kiss to demonstrate a passionate love, shouldn't it be a real kiss?"
4787,767020294,5,"I've seen four film versions of this wonderfully romantic story and have read the book, but until Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton fleshed the characters so perfectly I've been very disappointed in the cardboard-surface interpretations of these two fated lovers. This is the only version I've seen that had ANY sort of passion - the kind of passionate love that must be fulfilled regardless of any obstacle. That's what the story is about isn't it? The passion shown by these two actors, as they become two of the most famous characters in literature, fairly flew off the screen and into my heart.
Of course, I first saw the stone-faced Orson Welles - Joan Fontain version - a really insipid Jane, but I loved her until Samantha came along - an impish Jane with spirited opinions she endeavors to hide - but fails. Her beauty shines through the plain-Jane hair and make-up and you know why Edward Rochester is willing to risk all to be with her. The other actress-Janes I won't bother to comment on!
Ciaran Hinds is an elusive blend of understanding tenderness and explosive passion - of course Rochester would be full of pent-up passions just waiting to be unleashed - with the kind of past he's led. And Ciaran certainly lets us feel what is in his heart and soul. I absolutely love the little-boy glimpse you get of Rochester as he confronts Jane in the driveway after she returns from the visit to her aunt.
As to the parts of the novel that were omitted, yes there were some - most of them cluttered the story - in my opinion. All right to read about but slowed the pace as too much extraneous padding in other film versions. A little editing after 150 years isn't always a bad thing!
I greatly admire actors who can portray their thoughts through the expressions that flit across their face. Most of this cast does this very well.  Mrs. Fairfax - Gemma - is priceless and she is also the best-cast of any I've seen. I've watched this version of Jane Eyre dozens of times. Ciaran Hinds was wonderful in ""Persuasion"" but, Oh My! he really shows his passionate Irish heritage in this film! I love it!"
4788,767020294,1,"why the screenwriter decided to ditch all the most famous dialogue and many of the most pivotal scenes in this extremely pedestrian ""Jane Eyre"". All lost are the Aunt's deathbed confession to Jane, the buddha-like teachings of Helen in the hellish Lowood school, the gypsy fortune telling scene that infuriates Blanche Ingram, and even the chestnut tree cleft in half as a manifestation of God's displeasure! No sign either of ""He saw that the boy had inherited his own eyes as they once were: large, brilliant, and black""--that's one of the most famous lines in English literature, for crying out loud!!
I was more disappointed than I can say to see that Ciaran Hinds, so wonderful in ""Persuasion"", was so terrible in this. And Samantha Morton as Jane was even worse. There wasn't a hint that she had lived through the childhood Jane Eyre had to become the governess Rochester encounters in the mist.
Please, if you have never seen ""Jane Eyre"", don't make this sorry mess your introduction to that magnificient novel. Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine did such a better job of it!"
4789,767087372,5,Great price and cheaper then the big box store.
4790,767087372,5,great
4791,767087372,5,Wonderful series..I became part of the family both upstairs and downstairs..I am so in love with all these British series.
4792,767087372,5,Great series
4793,767087372,5,"This Batch of British Treacle was Especially Strange as I'D seen Many Other English Sagas prior. As I came to it at LAST ,Rather than First , I knew it desired from me a LOT of Apt Attention. I , Naturally, Gave it That. And became Addicted in process. Yummy AND Soapy , enjoy in as small or LARGE of doses as possible. BUT ENJOY!!!!!"

4799,767020294,4,"Having only seen the Timothy Dalton and William Hurt versions also, this is decidedly my favourite adaptation of the novel so far.
Although the Dalton and Clarke version is the most faithful rendition of the novel, I still can not help liking this adaptation more. Dalton's performance as Mr Rochester is superb and flawless but he is far too handsome for my liking. Clarke is just satisfactory - her Jane is too weak and bland. With respect to the Hurt and Gainsbourgh rendition, I was unfortunately quite bored after Anna Paquin departed from the screen. However, this was mainly attributed to improper screenplay and direction and  the lack of chemistry between the two lead characters.
After seeing Ciaran Hinds' brilliant performance in `Ivanhoe' and `Persuasion', I had to watch this version. However, I was quite disppointed as he portrays a rather savage, arrogant and simple Mr Rochester and fails to depict the absolute complexity and glamour of Bronte's character as others have mentioned in their reviews. For this I solely blame the directors though, for Hinds' undoubtedly has the capacity to provoke the audience in the same manner that Bronte's Mr Rochester does the reader ( - evidence from his numerous awesome performances clearly suggest so).
Samantha Morton is undeniably my favourite Jane though. She is far more vivacious and yet more solemn than Zelah Clarke and exudes much more passion than Charlotte Gainsbourgh (but for that I also blame misguided direction & screenplay engineered by Zeffirelly & Whitemore). Morton is perfect for the part and Hinds would be to if only proper direction was given and pivotal dialogue was included. Nevertheless, apart from these failures I still enjoyed this film.
Thus, if you want to see a good film, I definitely recommend this, but if you want to watch a totally true adaptation of Bronte's novel then it is better to see the Dalton and Clarke rendition."
4800,767020294,1,"Rochester has been one of my all time favorite heroes. Jane Eyre one of my all time favorite books and heroines. I read it almost yearly.
I am a fan of Ciaran Hinds (believe it or not). After seeing him in Ivanhoe, where he brought such a wonderful wounded, smokey edge to Gilbert, I remarked to a friend of mine, ""wouldn't he just be the penultimate Rochester?"" I was thrilled to find out shortly thereafter that this was going to be the case. Wow!!! I couldn't wait to see it.
And then I did.
What were the director and the scriptwriters thinking? After such a subtle moving proformance in Ivanhoe, Mr Hinds turns Rochester into a strutting, bellowing, obnoxious bully. Eu[...] Our Jane would NOT want this jerk. I was embarressed for him! Not to mention disappointed and sad for such a missed opportunity with this production.
The actress who played Jane did it passably well but still no great shakes.
And *where* did the writers get this dialogue? Did they have any clue what the book was about, or did they do the Cliff Notes and then write the screenplay, 'spicing' things up a little, just because? ....
If you haven't seen any productions of JE, spare yourself this one. Instead look for the one with Timothy Dalton, or with George C. Scott."
4801,767020294,5,"I read this book long before I saw the movie and I definitely say that it lived up to my expectations.  Jane Eyre is a timeless story and it is beautifully captured in this gothic tale of romance and hidden secrets.  Each character is portrayed very well.  Samantha Morton (who plays Jane Eyre), actually became her seemingly meek and yet truly passionate character before my very eyes.  I would recommend this film to anyone who loved the book, as well as anyone who loves romance and a bit of mystery."
4802,767020294,5,"I was disheartened to read some of the reviews of this wonderful adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's story.  I have seen every version of this story and I believe that this is my favorite.  Ciaran Hinds is a fine actor and I do believe that his performance in this production needs a little more credit than usually given.  Rochester is a hard character to protray and given the script he did superbly.  Samantha Morton is by far the best Jane I have ever seen.  She can show more feelings in one expression of her face than I could do in a million years.

I can't stop watching this movie over and over again."
4803,767020294,2,"I was so excited when I heard A&E was doing ""Jane Eyre,"" especially when I heard Ciaran Hinds was cast as Rochester. I thought that was perfect casting and that I would see something of the caliber of ""Pride and Prejudice."" I was bitterly disappointed! What a travesty!
My main objection is that the scriptwriter decided she could improve on Charlotte Bronte. Instead of sticking to the words in the book as closely as possible, she completely rewrote the dialogue. What arrogance! The result is that both Rochester and Jane say things that are completely out of character to anyone that's read the book. ""I feel your passions are aroused""? I found myself screaming at the screen ""he'd never say that!""
My second main objection was how Ciaran Hinds was directed to play Rochester. I blame the director because I've seen Hinds in many movies and know the range of emotion he can display. In this version he was essentially one-note: he shouts all the time. The ONLY time he softens is in the bedroom with Jane after the fire. That one scene showed me what could have been, and only sharpened my disappointment with the rest. What a sad waste of what could have been a marvelous production.
I did like Samantha Morton's Jane best of all the Janes (I've seen every version of this). I just wish she'd been given better dialogue to speak.
The Timothy Dalton version remains my favorite. Too bad Hinds and Morton didn't have that script and that director!"
4804,767020294,2,"Extremely disappointing production.  Adumbrates the story.  The makers apparently didn't believe the audience could take the real Jane Eyre, as they dumbed it down and tarted it up.  They turned a complex, multifaceted drama into a Harlequin miniseries.  What a shame: we need somebody to do for Jane Eyre what BBC/A&E did so perfectly for Pride & Predudice."
4805,767020294,5,"After seeing this production of Jane Eyre by A&E how could you EVER need or want to see another? The movie itself is beautiful~ it really catches the dark textured landscapes of the book. But above that, the cast is simply brilliant. Samantha Morton as Jane can say about sixty contrasting things at once by turning her head. Rochester is perfect as well~ he's really quite funny in some scenes. While the whole cast is great (and the little girl Jane is wonderfully cute as well as talented) the two main actors just stand out and completely carry the film. A truly wonderful adaption of such a great book."
4806,767020294,3,"If you read the book first, you may be disappointed that much of the story has been omited or changed. This version of Jane Eyre probably would have been more appealing for me had I not read the book for the third time when I rented this movie.  I have also seen the Orson Welles version but being that I am not a Welles fan I could not over look the man for the character.  The Timothy Dalton version was somewhat better for me since more of the story was put in the movie and then the Hinds version was most disappointing mainly because so much story line was left out and alterations were made. Although this version emphasises more the Rochester/Jane relationship I would have enjoyed it more if it had been more true to the story and spent more time on the relationship of the two characters. My advice would be to rent several versions before purchasing, especially if you read the book first.  I had set in my mind the perfect Jane and Mr. Rochester and doubt that I will ever find them in a movie adaptation."
4807,767020294,5,"I have seen every version of ""Jane Eyre"" ever made mutliple times, and nothing does justice to that beautiful book like this version. Ciaran Hinds IS Edward Rochester. I have read the book multiple times, and none of the other actors I've seen quite fit the physical description. Ciaran Hinds is perfect. He fits perfectly. The man is amazing, and Samantha Morton is superb. She strikes the perfect balance between quietness and spirit. The only problem I had with it was the fact that they left out one of St. John's sisters. That is it. The chemistry between Hinds and Morton is unspeakably beautiful. I normally do not cry at movies, but this one leaves me weeping absolutely helplessly by the end. Edward Rochester is my favorite male character ever in any book I've ever read (and I've read quite a few). Ciaran Hinds captures the essence of Rochester. If I were more eloquent, I could find more words to describe this movie, but nothing can until you see it for yourself."
4808,767020294,3,"If you liked this version so much, you're better off with the VHS. The video transfer on DVD is VERY bad, like seeing it on television, minus the clarity of cable tv.
So far I haven't seen a movie that really did justice to Bronte's Jane Eyre. Ciaran Hinds' portrayal of Rochester was too caustic and gruff, even for Bronte's version, and the playful relationship he had with little Adele was not true to the book. Ciaran was at his best in Jane Austen's Persuasion, which I recommend to anyone who liked this movie. The BEST Rochester was probably Orson Welles' portrayal. Unlike Welles' movie, this version included Jane's interaction with St. John, which was a bonus.
Best to rent this first for yourself before buying it."
4809,767087372,5,"My wife has watched it twice already, and enjoys every minute of it."
4810,767087372,4,"We've watched only two or three episodes so far, as  we've been watching other things and most critically, our DVD player has died!  We're a little disappointed that thus far this has been in black and white."
4811,767087372,5,good buy
4812,767087372,5,"Excellent, just as wonderful as I remember from when I was a teen. Love having this. Great viewing for a rainy night!"
4813,767087372,5,A very enjoyable series - viewing these episodes while walking on my treadmill has made the Ohio winters a bit more tolerable.
4814,767087372,3,"Enjoyable, but not great. A poor man's Downton Abbey"
4815,767087372,5,A nice set. But not as good as Downton Abbey.
4816,767087372,5,Loved this series. So glad I bought it. I have watched it many times. Loved it
4817,767087372,5,A great series and it's best seen from the beginning instead of a bit here and a bit there
4818,767087372,5,fun seeing this again
4819,767020294,2,"This was a drab, nothing little piece of a movie.
Why even try to capture the beauty of the original when you can do it so boringly in color?
Yuck."
4820,767020294,5,"This is a wonderful adaptation of a great book.  The actors are amazing and the story is one of the best ever written.  This is a story about passion, love conquering all, and is full of strong, well-developed, and wonderful characters.  Watching it feels like you are a part of the story, and it is a masterpiece."
4821,767020294,4,"Welles did such a definitive Rochester for me, exactly as my mind's eye saw him in the novel, that it is hard for me to appreciate anyone else in that role.  However, George C. Scott did a very good, very restrained Rochester in his later version and this version presents a very good Rochester as well.  Morton as Jane Eyre confirms my earlier opinion from her performance in ""Sweet And Low Down"" that she is an actress to watch.  As far as faithfulness to the novel, I really don't demand that from films which are a very different creative medium from novels. The basic story has become a timeless classic, often copied but never equaled.  Jane is a poor orphan who becomes a governess for Rochester's ward.  He is a wealthy man with a beautiful estate.  They fall in love but a horrible dilemma from his past comes forth to haunt them both.

4822,767020294,2,"More Harlequin romance than Charlotte Bronte novel, this is an agreeable enough production.  The acting is decent but the script!  Trite and overly dramatic, it made me wince every time.  By all means get this for the light romance but don't mistake this for anything even close to Bronte's vision.  The last two versions were much better."
4823,767020294,5,"I started reading this book last week and decided to rent the movie. They only had this version of Jane Eyre and was hesitant to watch it because I had never heard of the actors before. As the movie started I noticed that  it skipped the beginning of the book (began at the red-room incident)and  spent more time towards Jane Eyre as an adult. When I first saw Ciaran  Hinds (Mr. Rochester) I thought - this man isn't very attractive and he is  really mean!  Jane Eyre will never fall for him! But, Mr. Hinds played the  role wonderfully and even I looked beyond his roughness and fell inlove  with the character!  Samantha Morton played a wonderful Jane Eyre and I  really felt the chemistry between the two throughout the movie.  I think my  favorite scene was when he was waiting for Jane to get back from preparing  for her aunts funeral and was very jealous.  And the ending made me cry!  I  later rented a different version of Jane Eyre with William Hurt in it, and  disliked it very much.  There was no chemistry between the lead actors and  I was glad that I rented this version first!"
4824,767020294,1,"Jane Eyre is one of my all-time favorite stories, so I have leapt at the chance to see every  version ever filmed.
I was particularly anxious to see this one, produced by A&E, because, in my mind, they have a  deserved reputation for accuracy and for quality productions.  I have to  say, though, that this version was a terrible disappointment, not only  because of the time-constrained abridgement of the text, but because of the  portrayals of the lead characters.  In particular, the actor playing Mr.  Rochester portrayed him as a TOO angry, sneering, ranting, bellicose,  offensive man.  (I don't know whether I should blame the actor or the  director).  It was just asking too much of the viewer to believe that Jane  could find any redeeming qualities in him at all, let alone fall hopelessly  in love with him!
The most accurate and well-acted version of this  wonderful book, in my opinion, is the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version.  (It AMAZED me that someone actually found fault with this production  because that viewer thought that they took TOO MUCH script, verbatim, from  the book)! One of the most positive attributes of the Dalton/Clarke version  is that they remained true to Miss Bronte's ""script,"" and the  performances, right down through the supporting cast, were absolutely  superb!  It is the ONLY version which I've purchased for my collection; I  have also purchased three other copies to give as gifts to friends for  their viewing pleasure, and they agree that Dalton and Clarke ARE Rochester  and Jane!"
4825,767020294,5,"This version is about as true to the book as a 2 hour adaptation can be. True, the Blanche Ingram in this version demonstrates that they even had bad dye jobs a hundred years ago, but it's better than Elle MacPherson (Oh  Mylanta!) as Blanche.
The movie is perfect, with the same gray and  gothic feel as the book, and Samantha Morton has the restraint and spine  you'd expect Jane to have.  If you've seen the movie on A&E but didn't  see it the first time it aired 3 years ago, you need to get a copy- there  are probably 20 minutes extra of scenes you've not seen yet (in particular,  a great scene of Jane and Edward in town where they run into Blanche and  her strange, Groucho eyebrows).
Every time I see the movie in the scene  by the tree where she pours her heart out to Edward, I lose it.  At the  end, he pours his heart out to him, I lose it.  My boyfriend even claims  that he ""almost"" lost it- and let me tell you, that's High Praise  from Mr. Pulp Fiction.
People will tell you it is romantic- and it is-  but not in a Fabio-with-the-hair-flowing kind of way. It's just genuine,  with a great chemistry between the actors that makes you believe these two  characters are in love in a deep, bonded kind of way."
4826,767020294,5,"I can't even count the number of times I've watched this one! The performances by both Samantha Morton & Ciaran Hinds are both SUPERB! If you're a romance lover, this one's for YOU--I promise, you will NOT be  disappointed. I'm not going to get specific so as to not reveal any of the  juicy details of the story, so I remain mysteriously vague on purpose to  spur you on to buy this one for your DVD collection. The story is tragic,  but with a happy ending for all. It will keep you on the edge of your seat  & hungering for more all the way to the end. I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this  movie, & I refuse to ever watch any previous versions, that's how taken  with this one I am!  Highly Recommended!"
4827,767020294,5,"This, to me, was a beautiful film.  I have only seen this version and the original one with Orsen Welles.  To me, there is no comparison between the two- the A & E version by far and away the most spectacular.  It  captured the true depth of the story. I thought Hinds, especially, was  fabulous.  The scene near the end when Mr. Rochester says:  ""But Jane,  I would die for want to see your face"" is so moving it brings the  tears flowing every time I see it.  The true depth of passion between the  two lovers came through so beautifully, in my opinion. Hinds is not  necessarily handsome which makes him wonderful for the role. It is the  beauty within our souls.  That message came through wonderfully in this  version. The script was also a fine piece of work.  I loved the beautiful,  poetic language.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who yearns for a  great love story.  The love between the two main characters is beautifully  portrayed within this film."
4828,767020294,3,"This version is my second favorite version behind the Dalton/Clark version.  The Dalton/Clark version is by far the ""best"" and most thorough version and though Dalton, IMO, is too handsome to play Rochester,  Dalton's performance is outstanding, as is Clarke's as Jane.  Hinds and  Morton are my second favorites.  This version is missing vital pieces of  the story, but the performances of Morton and Hinds are quite acceptable  and good.  I like the comic aspect they added (the scene where Jane returns  from visiting w/her dying aunt) and Rochester is seated on the wall outside  Thornfield and he complains to her about her not having written to him.  Hinds melted my heart in this scene and I have been a fan ever since.  Morton is good as Jane and delivered her lines perfectly.  This is an  entertaining version, again, not as thorough as the Dalton/Clarke version,  but it is enjoyable and is worth the viewing."
4829,767020731,5,IMHO this is the best Monty Python episode of all. Wanted to see it again and show it to a friend so bought it on a whim. Probably should just buy the whole series or season.
4830,767020731,5,"To this day, Monty Python remains THE idol and source of inspiration to humourists all around. Monty Python's Flying Circus made the group famous, and it is the best ever to come out, not only from Monty Python, not only from Britain... but humour in general!
Highlights on this tape: The Ministry Of Silly Walks, The Spanish Inquisition, Flying Lessons/Hijacked Plane (To Luton), 'The Bishop', Accidents Sketch and Registry Office.
Own it!"
4831,767020731,5,"Season 2 of Monty Python is truly the best of all their seasons.  It was here that the boys really hit their stride.  The first season, while quite good, had many moments of awkward silence from an audience that didn't  quite know what to make of the anarchy before them.  The show also looked  cheapand many bits seemed to fall flat.  In the second season, the group  grew better together and came out with some of the funniest and most famous  bits they ever did.  The Spanish Inquisition bit is one of the most popular  and is still hilarious today.  The sight of them rushing on a bus to get to  the studio to deliver their punchline before the credits end is classic.  John Cleese as the Minister for Silly Walks is brilliant in it's lunacy.  To try to introduce the group to America they re-staged some of their best  sketches from Season 2 together under the title ""And Now For Something  Completely Different.""  One of my favorites from this collection  (besides How Not to be Seen) is Cleese's class on How to Defend Yourself  from Someone Who is Attacking You Armed with a Piece of Fresh Fruit.  This  set is a MUST HAVE for all Monty Python fans."
4832,767020294,4,"This is the 3rd adaptation of Jane Eyre I saw. I liked this one more than 1983 and 1996 versions, because the characters were very likable, and the passion on screen was moving. Some reviewers found Ciaran Hinds stiff; I  disagree. He was a wonderful Mr. Rochester, as was Samantha Morton a  perfect Ms. Eyre. This is something you would want to watch over and over  again, if you are a romantic person, preferably an Austenite. However, the  adaptation is really loose, and important details from the book are  omitted. So if you are looking for a faithful adaptation, or watching the  movie to avoid reading the book, this is not the one. 83 version is very  loyal to the book, but they are almost reading from the book. 96 version is  generally loyal, but the omitted parts are the romantic parts, so where is  the fun? This one is the best one I have seen until now, but I will keep  looking for a miniseries that includes all the main details, and brings the  passion in the book alive. (I am not obsessed with loyalty to the book in  general, but Jane Eyre is a perfect book, and I miss all the parts that are  left out.)"
4833,767020294,4,"This is a beautiful film. I think that A&E does a good job in picking out the scenery and places. It is a masterpiece if you like to watch films simply for the scenery. It needs more detail and a lot more time added to  it. They seamed to smash everything into one movie and you can tell. It is  a good, clean, family film and I would certaily recomend it. I don't know  about buying it though. You would need to watch it first. The actors did a  good job, except Rochester could have been a little less forceful. I leave  it up to your decision if you like it or not. Enjoy! (I hope!)"
4834,767020294,5,"I loved this film and will watch it again and again.  It has introduced to me the elequant Samantha Morton and viriley dashing Ciaran Hinds. Together, they give fire and spark to this timeless lovestory."
4835,767020294,5,"Although I have yet to see the Timothy Dalton release, this is my favorite. You can see and feel the passion felt between these two characters more in this movie than any so far.  That was the whole point in  the book wasn't it, to take two characters who were seemingly homely and  cause you to love them both because of their intense feelings for each  other? It's great!"
4836,767020294,3,"This is probably my least favorite adaptation.  It includes dialogue and scenes that weren't even in the book. Where do people get off re-writing one of the greatest books in history?  Still, though, I must say that at  least they got the characters right. Mr. Rochester was an absolute bear at  first, which is what he should be.  Jane Eyre actually looked the right  age, although I thought she was more aggressive than in the book. The book  really has too much to be done within a 90 minute format. I wish people  would stop trying to squeeze months or years into hours. It just doesn't  work!  It does capture some of the spirit of the story, but not enough to  make it interesting. Skip it."
4837,767020294,5,"This A&E version of Jane Eyre once again brings life to the story of the abused orphan who eventually becomes governess to the ward of the mysterious and brooding Edward Rochester.  This is a superbly acted and  directed piece of work.  Had it been made for the big screen, I am certain  there would be Oscar nominations for Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds.  Morton plays the role to perfection.  There's a mysterious twist to the  story that will move you even if you've seen it before.  No superlatives do  justice to this film. Don't miss it!  It's a great watch!"
4838,767020294,5,"I wonder why this made for television film was not released as an actual feature film, because I feel it deserves to be. I had not yet watched any of the other renditions or even read the book . After reading the video  back cover, I was actually discouraged from viewing it.
It seemed as  far-fetched and stereotyped as a harlequin romance. Plain virtuous orphan  girl becomes nanny/governess and meets rich macho employer and both fall in  love.  I was reminded of The Sound of Music, which is a great movie, but  rather too cliche. I really didn't expect to find a strong and believable  characters and plot.
Despite my reservations, because I think Ciaran  Hinds is one fine actor, and because I  generally enjoy period films and it  was a free rental, so I took it home.
I was immediately taken and drawn  in upon viewing, and within a few minutes I found myself bawling my eyes  out. The acting, scenery, sense of  momentum, sexual tension and romantic  longing  are intensely captivating. This is a very passionate film. I  couldn't get it out of my system for a few days, and have now read the  book.
I find that this screenplay'storyline is in some ways even more  captivating and poignant, and yet still quite believable, than the book! I  also find the mood, casting and the acting to both ring uncannily true to  the characterization and physical attributes as  described in the book.
The fact that there is alot of gothic mystery and classic retribution  gives the story genuine depth.
Despite the cliches of : attraction of  opposites, poor girl/rich man, young girl/older man... these things do  happen probably because of the strong  archetypal/socio-economic/psychological forces involved. This film  portrayal captures the chemistry and tension in such a union perfectly."
4839,767020294,4,"I disagree with the viewer from Cambrige Ontario. I found this version lovely! Samantha Morton was excellent (I need to see ""Emma"" now), reserved, thoughtful, just as Jane was in the book. Jane had high emotions  but did not strike out often...the childhood was a small part of the book,  and though important, it is not the major part of the story. The  relationship with Bessie and Helen and Mrs Reed are important as well. I  found this version to be just fine, and I am going to buy it!"
4840,767020294,1,"I read Jane Eyre for the first time at the age of 15. Over the years I have eagerly watched every filmed version as they appeared. I previously thought the Orson Welles version was the worst, but I changed my mind once  I saw this. The BEST film of Jane Eyre is the Susannah York/George C. Scott  version, done in the early 1970's for Hallmark Hall of Fame. Wonderful in  every way!! Unfortunately, not available yet on video. AVOID this version  from A&E, it is truly terrible. Ciaran Hinds plays Mr. Rochester as a  loud, bullying, scenery-chewing lout, and I have seldom seen a shallower,  more pallid performance as Jane. Skip this movie and re-read the novel!"
4841,767087372,5,"Will always enjoy watching  Upstairs/Downstairs.  So well done in every way.  Favorite actor, Jean Marsh, also Lesley Anne Down."
4842,767087372,5,Classic TV Show. Would use seller for other DVD's.
4843,767087372,5,"A classic, need I say more"
4844,767087372,5,Just what I like.
4845,767087372,2,Best ever!
4846,767087372,5,Half way through these
4847,767087372,5,"Loved it when it came out all those years ago - love it still.  This series retains its cachet.....If you love Downton Abbey, you should try this series as well!  Look for some actors who have gone on to other memorable performances....."
4848,767087372,4,"rather disappointing after Mr S
acting and characters great
sets and clothing pathetic"
4849,767087372,1,"Ordered a couple of DVD's at one time.  Didn't start watching 'Upstairs' until about a month after I got it.  Have discovered that the first disk of Season 1 and the first disk of Season 2 are both BLANK. So far, the rest of the disks in these two seasons are fine.  I wanted to return them but Amazon says it is beyond the return time period.  That's bogus.  It's obvious that they're defective.  If Amazon is this hard nosed, I may not renew my prime membership."
4850,767087372,4,A bit of a slow starter.  The characters were great.  I enjoyed the story line.
4851,767087372,4,"I loved it.  the first few shows are a little ruff, after all it was made 40 plus years ago, but then it leveled out and was really good."
4852,767087372,2,"Didn't know sever series are in black & white. I  felt it was to drab, and very boring. just not my cup of tea!"
4853,767087372,3,"It was a bit of a letdown after how posh Downton Abby which is so beautifully filmed. I am getting into to it though. It has great charters and I like how it deals with issues..
Great stories."
4854,767087372,5,The series arrived in great shape and I am enjoying all the episodes.  i would buy from you again if I found any other DVD's I liked. I will continue to use this seller..
4855,767087372,5,The humor and intrigue is simply rivetting. We like to imagine being in one or the other classes. It' hard to stop watching.
4856,767087372,1,"I can't even get past the first volume, it's pathetic, I wouldn't recommend to anyone who didn't want to fall asleep from pure boredom.  Some were black and  white due to a strike when it was made and it's just a chopped up mess.  Wasted my money on this one."
4857,767087372,5,"I missed this on public TV and and very happy that we have the opportunity to purchase the long running show on a DVD.
Excellent story line and excellent acting. I know you will be glued to the TV to watch each episode."
4858,767087372,5,Amazing I really loved the story and all the characters where amazing and I enjoyed it very much and recommended to everyone who is interesting in that kind of stories
4859,767087372,5,This show from so many years ago was probably the first to intimately investigate the lives of the downstairs staff as well as the upstairs lives of their rich aristocrat employers all living in a London West End mansion before and after World War I.  If you are a fan of Downton Abbey you are sure to enjoy Upstairs Downstairs.
4860,767087372,3,"...but giving 3 stars because I am disappointed with the packaging of it.  Series 2 was missing disc 2 (episodes 5,6,7) but doubles of disc 4. Series 3 was missing disk 1 (Episodes 1,2,3,4)  but doubles of disc 3. This made for frustrating viewing. Not sure how to get this problelm fixed. But as for the movie - if you like drama, there is plenty of it in this movie."
4861,767087372,5,People who enjoed Downton Abbey will like very much this earlier series. Much more sharp than the later follower. Subtitles will be especially welcome for a non native English speaker.
4862,767087372,5,"I have heard of this series for years, but never had the chance to see it. So when i clicked on amazon  and saw the price it was (to me) a bargain!
Writing and acting are great. It really gives the sense of that period in history. If you like Downton Abby, you will like this. Definitely recommend this series."
4863,767087372,5,The collection is just what I expected.  There were no problems with the order and we will enjoy it for years to come.
4864,767087372,5,"First off, I am writing this for my wife as it was given to her. She rather enjoys watching these episodes. Good acting and interesting plots. I will leave it for others to get into more detail about the set."
4865,767087372,5,"Upstairs, Downstairs is a gem of a show. I happen to watch Downton Abbey first, and the first 3 seasons were great ot that series. This series is truly outstanding as well and maybe even better. I just completed watching season one.  I was spellbound by the awesome cast. This series being shot on tape verse film, gives you a feel of live stage and the performances are presented like a play. The acting is great and the stories a very suprising and bold. I am looking forward in the coming weeks and months to continue to see what unfolds in the continuing seasons of this complete series collection. If an individual enjoyed Downton Abbey, they would truly enjoy this series.

A"
4866,767087372,5,"I'm not through with the complete series, but am into the end of the 3rd season and am enjoying it. I must admit that I have a problem with the accents of a few of the characters, but the plots are masterful and I see why it was an award winner."
4867,767087372,5,i got hooked on this series from wathing it on netflix. it was because of this that i got hooked on downton abbey lol :P
4868,767087372,5,"Old and new fans alike will become addicted to the intrigue and drama of the Downton Abbey predecessor and see many similar storylines between the two shows. The seasons are lengthy, as well as the episodes, and so there are months of entertainment packed into this series compared to more modern series that can be binge-watched. There are also interesting special features for those who want to dig in deeper."
4869,767087372,5,"I've watched the complete series at least 3 times over a period of years. The characters are well developed and the story line leaves you wanting more.
It is an all time favorite!!! A must see. And see again"
4870,767087372,4,"We have greatly enjoyed the 2005 A&E Collector's Edition (now out of print) and were not annoyed by the DVD video quality.  Independent reviewers such as dvdverdict, dvdbeaver, and others give this 2011 Acorn collection overall higher marks for DVD transfer quality, with the understanding of the limitations inherent in mastering a '70's British TV series.

BTW, Acorn's own site now indicates that this particular edition (Upstairs, Downstairs: The Complete Series - 40th Anniversary Collection) is not in stock, is no longer available and customer service informs me via email that ""we will not be restocking this item."" [However, individual seasons are still available ($$$)] So, once stocks of the complete series are depleted at Amazon and other retailers, future buyers may have to wait awhile for the next complete series edition, whenever."
4871,767087372,5,"I remember well when this series was broadcast in the 1970's/.It's a delightful series and very similar to Downton Abbey, or I should say, DA is quite similar to Upstairs, Downstairs. Being of English ancestry, I discovered more of the British personality and liked what I saw and experienced."
4872,767087372,5,"What to say, a classic, the best of British television. It looks like Downton Abbey may be a close rival but upstairs downstairs is the epitome of good theater."
4873,767087372,2,I'm a Downton Abbey junkie and hoped this series would satisfy my cravings between seasons.  It does not come close.  The acting is not even up to daytime soap opera level. The sets are cheap-looking and not at all reflective of the era.  What I've watched thus far reminds me of high school plays--seriously.  I finished two seasons and that's all I could take.  Maybe the others are better.  I'll probably not know because I'm not at all into any of these characters or the storylines.
4874,767087372,5,"Once you start watching a few episodes, it's hard to stop. It's like a soap opera years ago, you feel as though you know the characters and want to see what develops..."
4875,767087372,1,No star. Low quality production and casting...is there anyway we can return this after viewing only one of the DVDs and get some money back?
4876,767087372,5,"I actually watched the more recent Upstairs Downstairs before the 70s series and was very impressed with the original version. The new version simply did not compare and I can see why it was canceled after two seasons. I enjoyed traveling through time and witnessing the changes upstairs, downstairs, and around the world. I binge watched most of the series; you will not regret watching!"
4877,767087372,5,"I missed the series when it aired. The writing is terrific, and so is the acting. Several episodes have left me stunned -- in a good way. If you like Downton Abbey and are sorry their are so few episodes,go back and look at this series. It's the parent of the other one."
4878,767087372,3,"I remember looking forward to watching this miniseries just as I do Downton Abbey.
But I was disappointed because the quality of production and filming is not up to today's standard."
4879,767087372,1,"Very very disappointed with this selection. My plan was to return it, but after reading Amazons return policy on movies, was unable to. This is not what we expected.....very poor directing, poor quality, horrible & just unable to watch. We tried 2 hours of disc 1 & 1 hour of disc 3.....no change. I hope you will allow me to return. Thank you, Martha Laney"
4880,767087372,5,"Entertaining series with a good cast, costumes and actual history woven in.  I would definitely recommend  this for hours of viewing."
4881,767087372,2,"I was expecting this to be wonderful from the reviews, but due to the wretched moral values of many of the Upstairs people I had a hard time enjoying the story.  A few of the Downstairs people had difficulties, too, but they in general set better standards of conduct.  Wish I could sell my copy."
4882,767087372,1,"The DVD's I received are very poor quality, skipping frequently, etc., as well as just poor original filming quality. They are a great disappointment, actually, and I have had to force myself to keep watching. Compared to Downton Abbey, which I have watched over and over, Upstairs, Downstairs has been a huge disappointment in every way."
4883,767087372,3,After watching Downtown Abby i thought this film series would be more of the same.  Some what disappointed as it fell short to the quality of acting and presentation.  I have only watched a third of the series and am hope full it will get better as it goes.
4884,767087372,5,"It really does. OK, it was filmed forty years ago, so the odd wobbly wall etc, but if you don't fall in love with the well-written characters and evocation of Edwardian London you are not human."
4885,767087372,5,"From the first episode to the last we were so involved in the lives of the cast.  It was well done and even though it's forty years since it appeared on television, it still captured our interest."
4886,767087372,5,You will be caught up in the struggles and tribulations the family and house encounter over the years. A great precursor to Downtown Abbey.
4887,767087372,5,I have greatly enjoyed watching this series. I didn't have a tv when this ran so it was fun to watch. So glad someone recommended it as a buy. I would say that it is a Downtown Abbey type for before the 1st world war and a little during the 1st world war. I have seen the last year yet still watching it.
4888,767087372,2,"I watched the sequel first, which was so good it prompted me to watch the original series. I'm 3 episodes into season 1, and don't think I can slog my way through any more of it. The acting is horrendously hammy, and the story lines are foolish and juvenile. Unlike the recent Upstairs Downstairs, it's unrealistic (in one scene, one of the actresses was changing out of her clothes and you could see she was wearing bikini underwear under her white bloomers), and showed little of what the world was actually like in that era. The house it's set in is dull, and alll of the characters are over exaggerated, annoying, and unlikeable. Basically, it's just a bad 1970's Soap Opera."
4889,767087372,5,"Fast shipping and in pristine condition.
It's nice to be able to get outdated stuff in such great shape at such a good price."
4890,767087372,3,Very unhappy with this. Not told it was in black and white in parts. I returned it and got charged half of the purchase price. I will never buy another thing from you. What a rip off..
4891,767087372,5,If you like downtown abby you'll like this series too. You'll want to own the complete set so as to keep up with its soap opera like show. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do.
4892,767087372,5,"Upstairs,Downstairs,1971-1975,68 episodes,5 seasons. Time period covered 1903-1930. Setting:165 Eaton Place,London,England. Favourite actress: Jean March(Rose Buck).I watched Upstairs,Downstairs on PBS in the mid 70's and again when it reaired in the 90's. This box set is worth the money. Now I can watch all the episodes and behind the scenes extras.(When I bought my set,I received the reboot of the series,2010 edition,as a bonus. Setting:1936,still at 165 Eaton Place. Jean March reprises her role. The first season was the best,the second season,2 years later,was not as good but still watchable. Jean had a stroke so she only made 2 appearances).This is the the original Downton Abbey."
4893,767087372,3,"After watching Downton Abbey, we had expected much more. We are done with series 1 and are finally getting the characters and the humor.  It just seems a bit slow to us."
4894,767087372,1,"Not in the series, but that it was exclusively in black and white.
That should have been noted before the sale."
4895,767087372,1,Sold it on eBay for half the price after only watching 15. Minutes. Would recommend you only purchase one DVD before you buy the whole set. I had thought it would be like Downton  Abbey unfortunately it was not even close.
4896,767087372,2,"After watching Downton Abbey, I thought that this would be a good series to watch, so I purchased it. I found it dull, silly, and boring, and the worse part was that there were no subtitles and I could not understand it. BUT the seller refunded my money and even payed the postage to send it back, so I give the seller five stars."
4897,767087372,5,"At the time of purchase I was told to expect a delivery shortly after Christmas, but the seller jumped on the order and had it out immediately, with the unexpected outcome of it's having been delivered in time to slide under my mother's tree.

I can't critique the quality of the series or the quality of the production values, especially I haven't seen this series, and my mother has just started it.  What I do know is that she loves it already and has fallen in love with the Upstairs-Downstairs saga.  She understands that the production standards of the BBC at the time this series was filmed cannot compete with those in use today, and she also understands that there was a transition from black and white to color, following conventions of the time.  None of that matters to her, fortunately - it is the story that cannot be diminished, and that story is outstanding, by all accounts.

By the way, the box set arrived in perfect condition, thanks the seller's careful and competent packaging.  I highly recommend this seller and would never think twice about doing business with them again."
4898,767087372,5,I was very happy with this set of dvds. It was exactly what I wanted. I was very happy it had closed caption on it. My mother in law was thrilled.
4899,767087372,5,"We wondered what all the fuss was about. A forty year old series?! The quaint black and white pictures and simplistic sets in the first episodes recede from your consciousness as the stories draw you in. Before long, you have a vested interest in the lives of these people and the history they are living becomes vivid - and feels current. We missed them when we finished viewing and will watch it again."
4900,767087372,5,"Not only is this a great story about the lives of two classes, but it's enjoyable to learn how the historical events affected their lives."
4901,767087372,5,I missed most of the series the first time around and enjoyed seeing it all. I do wish there were fewer gaps in the stories. I wanted to see it after watching and becoming such a fan of Downton Abbey.
4902,767087372,5,"The beginning of this series starts off very slowly. It felt like watching a high school play.
That is unfortunate because viewers probably lose interest.  Please stay with it; it gets so
much better! I loved this series."
4903,767087372,5,I took a chance on this item as i had never seen it before. I am a HUGE Downton Abbey fan and felt if I enjoy that so much then why not this series? It took me a few episodes to get into it but now that i know the characters I have to say this is quite entertaining. Of course you have to remember this is a series from the 70's so if you are expecting to be as entertained as one is with downton Abbey then you will be disappointed. You must watch this series with the adult mindset that the 70's were a different time and filming was different and acting wasn't what it is today. I am thoroughly enjoying this series but really ticked off at how many characters have come and gone so far. What was up with that?
4904,767087372,5,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this series!!!!!  Great to get it as a whole series, not just season by season.  Very charming!"
4905,767087372,5,I did not get to see all the episodes when it originally aired.  So I was very happy to find it and receive the collection in excellent condition.
4906,767087372,4,Loved this one and the original as well. So different - yet the same in many ways. The characters are quite interesting. It is also fun to see the characters in other parts - other movies -
4907,767087372,3,"The dvd was fine and as usual, Amazon does a great job in fast delivery.

I did  not like the program, but that is just me.  Probably in its day it was cutting edge."
4908,767087372,5,"I am enjoying each and every one of the stories in this series.  Perhaps I'm the only person alive who never saw them before, but I'm thoroughly entertained by this well-made series."
4909,767087372,5,This was one of the best series I have ever watched. I became attached to the characters and cried when it all ended. Excellent story which has you wanting more and more. Parts are in black and white in the beginning so give it a chance and you will be hooked too!
4910,767087372,5,"One of the greatest dramatic series of all time, Upstairs Downstairs (U/D) is about life at 165 Eaton Place in Belgravia, one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in London.  It reflects the tensions between masters and servants, between different categories of servants, and between the existing order and those who do not fully accept it--servants who aspire to careers outside of domestic service, persons motivated by middle-class values, and the nouveau riche who respect money and power more than tradition.  Both upstairs and downstairs residents are influenced by British imperialism and xenophobia.

British actresses Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins conceived U/D as a comedy focused on the downstairs staff.  But it gradually evolved into a drama about the entire household--both upstairs and downstairs.  London Weekend producer Cyril Bennett did not believe that U/D would be successful.  He held Series 1 off the air for six months, then chose to broadcast it at 10:15 on Sunday nights.  Despite this scheduling, the show became one of the most popular PBS programs of all time.

The household is headed by Richard Bellamy (David Langton), the son of a clergyman, who has married Lady Marjorie, scion of the prominent Southwold family.  As a political and social conservative, Richard attains high administrative offices, but, as a member of Parliament, he prefers to vote according to his conscience rather than the Southwold family's preferences.  Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) is imperious and aristocratic.  Their son James (Simon Williams), an army officer, is plagued by such bad judgment that we generally cannot sympathize with him.  His sister Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett) is idealistic and romantic, but unrealistic.  Her relations with the male sex always turn out badly, until (having left U/D after Series 2) she is said to have found marital happiness in America.  Following Marjorie's death, management of the household falls to James's new wife Hazel (Meg Wynn Owen), the daughter of an accountant, who is guided by different values than other members of the Bellamy family.  Marjorie's niece Georgina (Lesley-Anne Down) arrives in Series 3, with a sense of idealism and adventure.  After the war, Richard marries Virginia (Hannah Gordon), who provides companionship and support.

The downstairs staff is directed by the butler, Hudson (Gordon Jackson), who relies on discipline to preserve traditional standards, and discretion to prevent scandal, but can be sympathetic when the occasion warrants.  Mrs. Bridges (Angela Baddeley), the cook, overcomes kitchen crises and follows household gossip.  Rose (Jean Marsh), the head house parlor maid, later ladies maid, is devoted to the family, but occasionally expresses dissatisfaction with her ""place"" in the system.  Under house parlor maid Sarah (Pauline Collins) makes up in imagination what she lacks in education; anxious to escape domestic service, she becomes a chorus girl.  Chauffeur Thomas Watkins (John Alderton) is something of a con-artist, but he evidently has genuine affection for Sarah.  Under house parlor maid Daisy (Jacqueline Tong) marries footman Edward (Christopher Beeny) and attempts to advance his career.  At the bottom of the servants' hierarchy is the kitchen maid Ruby (Jenny Tomasin).

Interestingly, all the award nominations went to the downstairs actors, although it seemed to this reviewer that nearly all the actors put in strong performances.  Two personal favorites are Raymond Huntley's portrayal of the very formal, punctilious, and bespectacled family solicitor, Sir Geoffrey Dillon; and Jenny Tomasin's performance as the uneducated and unrespected scullery maid Ruby.  Tomasin took to heart Jackson's comment that there were no small parts, only small actors, and her rendering of Ruby may become a model for future actresses.  Fortunately, there are occasions on which Ruby knows more than the other servants, and when she shows initiative by leaving 165 Eaton Place to take a factory job, and by soliciting correspondence through a dating service--these events prevent Ruby from becoming a caricature.

The 68 episodes vary in quality; but there are few really poor ones.  The stories deal with a wide range of matters, including family relations, infidelity, divorce, inappropriate pregnancies, miscarriages, espionage, murder, suicide, casualties of war, politics, and the consequences of prosperity and depression.  Many episodes are connected to such real events as the death of Edward VII, World War I, the Silvertown munitions factory explosion, the 1926 General Strike, and the Stock Market Crash.  The producers gave great attention to verisimilitude -for example, consulting with Buckingham Palace staff regarding protocol for hosting the king's visit to 165 Eaton Place.

Many viewers consider Series 1 (1903-1909) the least successful.  (Most of this series was not aired in the U.S. until many years later.)  It had a lower budget than subsequent series; and, due to a technicians' strike, the first half dozen episodes were filmed in black and white.  Writers, directors, and actors were still trying to set the parameters for the program.  As a result, this series includes several strange stories; and some characters (especially the footman Alfred), lack credibility.  Some performances are too loud, too demonstrative, and poorly choreographed.  Many of the stories in Series 2 (1908 - 1910) provide various perspectives on marriage; others deal with problems created by a superannuated nanny and by Elizabeth's suffrage activities.  King Edward VII is a dinner guest in one episode; and this series ends with his death.  Series 3 (1912 - 1914) witnesses the arrival of Hazel Forrest as Richard Bellamy's secretary, and her marriage to James Bellamy.  Lady Marjorie having died on the Titanic, Hazel assumes the management of the household.  She eventually overcomes downstairs resentment; but her middle-class outlook leads to clashes with Richard and James.  This series ends with the outbreak of World War I.  The war casts a shadow over Series 4 (1914-1918), which many consider the best.  The Bellamys take in a family of Belgian refugees, James Bellamy and footman Edward join the army, other members of the household take on war-related duties; and a local baker, of German descent, becomes a victim of anti-German hysteria.  The war impacts the household in various ways--the staff must dine on ersatz meat and potatoes, James comes home severely wounded, and the house is hit by a bomb.  Series 5 (1919-1930) deals with life in the 1920s.  Richard finds happiness with his new wife Virginia.  But old values are challenged, as the younger generation engage in wild parties and other reckless behavior, aided by such new technologies as autos, airplanes, and motion pictures.  As a result of the stock market crash and the Depression, both upstairs and downstairs residents must leave Eaton Place to start new lives elsewhere.

It has been said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery; and U/D has had several imitators, including Beacon Hill (1975), as well as a new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Upstairs-Downstairs-2010/dp/B004N66XYE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Upstairs, Downstairs (2010)</a>&nbsp;.

Consider the similarities:  In both the wealth comes from the woman's side of the family.  Both Richard (U/D) and Robert (DA) are in precarious financial situations:  When Marjorie dies, the family fortune goes to Richard's children.  Without a male heir, Downton Abbey will go to another branch of the family.  In both programs:  (1) family members die (or appear to die) on the Titanic, (2) the young men are involved in World War I (in each, the principal young male character, after being missing in action, returns home gravely wounded; in each household, one of the domestic servants suffers from shell shock); (3) a young female member of the family becomes a wartime nurse; (4) a young woman dies from influenza; (5) there is a downstairs romance; (6) there is a homosexual footman; (6) a male aristocrat refuses to take responsibility for a child he has fathered by a maid; (7) an adventurous young daughter gets into trouble from her involvement in the suffrage movement; (8) the cook is courted by an unworthy suitor; (9) the question arises as to who will fill in for the ailing butler; (10) the household feels obliged to dismiss an unsatisfactory nanny; and (11) the family suffers from making bad investments.  Well, you get the idea.

This 21-disc set provides several supplementary features.  (1) The production of each Series is documented in an accompanying program, featuring interviews with writers, directors, actors.  (2) ""Russell Harty Goes Upstairs, Downstairs"" (1975), in which talk show host Russell Harty visits cast members on the set shortly after the final episode was broadcast.  (3) ""Upstairs Downstairs Remembered"" (1996), narrated by Gareth Hunt, in which cast members give accounts of behind-the-scenes problems and accomplishments.  (4)  In ""Sandy's Last Stand"" (2006), composer Alexander Faris describes how he wrote the theme music, including the ""upstairs"" theme and the ""downstairs"" theme (""What are We Going to Do With Uncle Arthur?"").  This includes performances of both the original 4/4 and the more familiar 3/4 versions of the upstairs theme, and the downstairs theme.

Upstairs Downstairs was the product of 9 writers and 8 directors.  Hence, there are some inconsistencies in the details and in the portrayal of characters.  There are relatively few scene changes; and the program often has the feel of a stage production.  Images of many outdoor scenes, which were filmed with smaller cameras, have noticeably lower resolution.  The 2010 Acorn release, on which this review is based, is said to be better than the previous A & E versions.  But, like some other reviewers, I have experienced a few problems with it.  Several episodes freeze.  I have not had similar problems with other Acorn products. [See NOTE below.] A list of all 68 episodes, indicating the discs on which they were reproduced, would have been a very desirable addition to this set.  I have compiled such a list and attached a copy inside the jewel case for each series; this enables me to go directly to the appropriate disc for whatever episode I wish to see.

By informal count, Upstairs Downstairs was nominated for 17 Emmys and received 7, most significantly, 4 successive awards for outstanding dramatic series.  It was nominated for 9 BAFTA awards and received 2; and was nominated for 4 Golden Globe Awards and received 1.  It also received a Peabody Award, a Royal Television Society Award; and its theme song won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Theme From a Radio or Television Production.  The program could have continued beyond five years, but the actors, writers, and directors chose to end it.  Cyril Bennett, who had been reluctant to air the program in the first place, pleaded vociferously, but ineffectively, with John Hawkesworth that the program should be  extended  for another ten years.  Thus, there have been no further episodes of this outstanding drama.

Christopher Hodson, who directed 14 episodes, described U/D as ""the sort of series that doesn't come along more than once in a lifetime.""  Few would disagree.

[NOTE:  The sticking problem seems to result from a spindle hole that is slightly too small.  Enlarging the spindle hole by as little as .001 of an inch with the aid of a round mini-file or fine sandpaper seems to correct the problem. Perhaps some other reviewer can explain why this is so.  Needless to say, be careful not to damage any other surfaces of a CD! ]"
4911,767087372,5,"I love this series nothing better then  good English acting  , a little dry some times but on a whole  I love it j.m.arnold"
4912,767087372,5,"I enjoyed it when it first came on PBS decades ago and I still enjoy it today; what a treat. If you liked it then, you should get it now. Well done."
4913,767087372,5,"This was a gift from my husband who remembers me being glued to the PBS series many years ago.  Always a joy to see the fine performances, settings, costumes and depiction of ""the good old days""???  Wow...they worked hard.  We are soooo spoiled now."
4914,767087372,5,"I didn't see this series when it first aired. But I fell in love with it thirty years later. My daughter saw it after me and felt the same way. We decided to purchase our own set so that we could watch it anytime. The revised 40th edition is so vastly imroved in picture clarity than the library copies that we originally viewed---even the episodes in black and white. We also learned a great deal about the production with the added hours. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Stellar writing, acting, and presentation."
4915,767087372,5,"As a teenager in the 70s, I had zero interest in this show, but was addicted to Happy Days and Laverne & Shirley. Cut to the present, and Middle Age, and I found myself completely absorbed by Downton Abbey, and so I figured maybe I should look into this classic. Watched them first on YouTube, and then immediately went out and bought the entire series. Because in my opinion, this show is hands down the GREATEST show to have ever aired on TV. Lacking the flash and impressive sets of DA, it nonetheless succeeds where it really matters - in the casting, the acting, and the writing. The show is subtle, and takes its time drawing one in, but once you 'get it"", OMG, do you EVER ""get it"". The writing is absolutely brilliant, despite the unevenness (some - not many -  episodes are not so good), and to me just underscores the basic ""humaneness"" of the series. NO character is one-dimensional. Life - and people - are portrayed SO realistically, with all the flaws, and triumphs, and joys, and insecurities inherent in all of us. All I can say, is give this show a chance. At some point, you're bound to realize how absolutely incredible the show is."
4916,767087372,5,This series was a birthday gift and the recipient was ecstatic. It was a very popular PBS show that aired years ago and worth watching again. And again
4917,767087372,5,This was purchased for mom at Christmas.  She absolutely loves the show.  This came well before Christmas was upon us.
4918,767087372,3,"I expected more or maybe I was expecting something like Downton Abbey.  Was enjoyable, but was somewhat disappointed.  I'll watch it...only once."
4919,767087372,5,"For those of you who are hooked on ""Downton Abbey,"" buy this DVD set!  ""Downton Abbey"" is a pale shadow of the original. Great actors, true-to-life stories and ""live-theatre"" feeling. ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" accurately and factually depicts life in Edwardian and WWI England and doesn't try to re-imagine life in those times (as does ""Downton Abbey"") so as not to offend the PC sensibilities."
4920,767087372,5,"This is the original Downton Abbey and it moves with a different pace, and is not so glitzy but I think it is better by far. It teaches so much about the war, The Great War."
4921,767087372,5,"I loved the original series and wanted to add it to my DVD collection.  Finally got a terrific price buying on Amazon.  Was purchased ""used"" for a very reasonable price and was in condition like new.  Looking forward to many enjoyable hours
watching this classic British series."
4922,767087372,5,"My family and I watched the entire box set this Summer and we all enjoyed it.  This is great television. From the first episode with Sarah, who made the series, one is drawn into this incredible world of classism, and just about every other type of social friction one can image.  A few episodes stand out like ""Rose's Pigeon"", ""I Dies For Love"" and ""The Beastly Hun"".  Downtown Abbey is a mere copycat of this classic!  All of the actors and actresses in Upstairs Downstairs were incredible.  I highly recommend it."
4923,767087372,5,"I watched this series when it was originally presented by Masterpiece Theatre, and now, some 40 years later, I wanted to see it once again.  I believe this is some of the finest drama presented by the BBC on American television, and the quality of the DVD set is excellent.  I enjoyed the experience once again, and am pleased to be able to add it to my library."
4924,767087372,5,"I had never seen this series when it was on tv.  I had heard such good things about it so I figured I'd see what it was all about.  At first I had a bit of a time getting into it, BUT...once I did...I was hooked.  It's a great series."
4925,767087372,5,"So in the last series, they decided to squeeze many episodes together. This resulted in the last one each DVD to crap out after about 15-20 minutes, rendering those episodes not viewable. A shame, really."
4926,767087372,5,"Good quality, nice bonus features.  Happy with purchase.  I bought the set because Netflix streaming no longer carries this series."
4927,767087372,5,"I haven't watched it yet, given as a gift. It was well recieved and has recieved great rewiews. Should prove to be a nice addition to a film collection."
4928,767087372,5,"We should not compare Upstairs Downstairs with Dawnton Abby, but enjoy both of them. I remember seeing Upstairs Downstairs 40 years ago, and it was absolutely great acting and the storyline captivating. The way movies are made now are of course changed, but that should not keep us seeing the ones made 40 or more years ago. I will recommend this DVD and go back in time."
4929,767087372,2,I had high expectations after seeing Downton Abby- this series is very old and the acting and filming is very subpar. It was not worth the money to me.
4930,767087372,5,"I am almost at the end of it and I don't want it to end!
The characters are great, the plot is superb, the production is unbelievable, specially if you take into account that it was made so many years ago."
4931,767087372,3,"Video is fine, but understanding British speech, although it is lovely, is nearly impossible with this series.  Understanding a percentage of the dialogue isn't good enough."
4932,767087372,1,too stagy.  maybe I ordered the wrong thing.  did not even finish the first episode.  too boring to whatch this
4933,767087372,5,"My husband enjoys Downtown Abbey with me and though we could remember watching this long ago, we couldn't remember it very well so the episodes are like watching it for the first time."
4934,767087372,5,"she enjoys the series, and this is a convenient way of seeing as few or as many episodes as she wants to, at any point"
4935,767087372,5,"The Complete Series Upstairs, Downstairs is a beloved drama set between 1903-1930 in Great Britain at the London mansion of an aristocratic family and their staff of domestic servants. It contains 68 episodes on 20 DVDs, plus one DVD with quite a few bonus features The first season comprises 13 episodes and the first episodes seem spare, especially in the dialog--more like stage plays than video dramas of today's miniseries.  Later episodes lose that stagey-ness and become very involved dramas. Since the original series broadcast in the US did not include the black-and-white episodes,  I was not familiar with the development of the series and how it grew from a rather simple initial season to rather involved arcs. For that ALONE, I'd recommend this set of DVD's because seeing them all in series is fascinating. And I saw entirely new episodes (for me) as I'd missed a lot of the first seasons, being off at college and without a television for some years.

I was also able to look at the opening titles with the drawings from ""Punch"" (A British humor magazine) and admire how the producers selected amazingly apt drawings to fit the particular episode.

Some of the initial episodes, sadly, are recorded only in black and white due to a technicians' strike in the early 70's. It doesn't actually detract from the enjoyment, just makes it a bit sad we can't see the sets and costuming as they were filmed. The black & white are sharp and clear, but the color episodes can be somewhat lower in resolution. The colors can be dim as well, but it doesn't detract. The cropping is often odd. This is not a perfect conversion from the television to DVD, but it's adequate and probably a lot has to do with changes in technologies since the 70's and the early days of television-to-DVD remastering.

 Essay by star and co-creator Jean Marsh

It's nice to go visit old friends again and have all the episodes and extras. There is a lot of value here, plenty to watch and re-watch, especially if you are a fan of BBC historical drama series. If you are a fan of ""Downton Abbey"" and don't know this series, you are in for a treat."
4936,767087372,5,"If you had ever seen or heard of Downton Abbey, you may as well see how it all began, and how the very foundation for our American public television heritage was built. Also, follow the trail of the great producer John Hawksworth (this, Duchess of Duke Street, Danger UXB, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and many more) to find a trail of genius."
4937,767087372,2,"VERY FIRST DISC WOULDN'T PLAY.TRIED FOR 2 MONTS FOR SATISFACTION FROM VENDOR
WAS REALLY CHEATED.I FINALLY HAD TO ORDER ANOTHER SET"
4938,767087372,5,"I remember hearing about this series when I was a kid. Probably during the original US run in the 70's. I think they reran it after that. I can remember watching part of one episode, but it didn't appeal to me. Well, maybe I was too young to appreciate it.

Fast forward to a few months ago. Now middle aged, I decided to give this series another try. At first, it seemed OK, but I wasn't sure if I'd want to spend the time getting through the whole series. Didn't seem quite as well done as more recent British TV. But, I watched a few more episodes and got more interested. Before I knew it, I was on the 5th and last series and realized I was almost done. I was sad to see the last episode end. The characters seemed almost like old friends by then.

I think the first episode is set in 1903 and the last in 1930. Many characters come and go, but many appear in the whole run like Mr. Hudson, Mrs. Bridges, Rose and Richard Bellamy.

The British class system in all its ""glory"" is illustrated as the series rolls on. And how it starts to unravel a bit as time moves forward. I guess as an American, it is hard to believe how those lower on the food chain put up with this system, but I guess we had something similar at the time here, but maybe less rigid. I'm told that the British still retain a bit of the old system even today, while we seem to have been a little more successful at getting rid of our old system.

But, I think one positive point that is often overlooked about the old system is well illustrated. There was some sense of family ties of a sort between the upstairs family and the long time servants downstairs.

The series did try to bring to life the big events going on at the time the series is set. It also showed how the upstairs people and the servants saw these events in very similar ways in many cases. I was surprised at how the servants were so often in agreement with the upstairs people on politics. Maybe they all valued stability and tradition very much and so agreed on the politics as a result.

Sometimes the formality of the interactions between the upstairs folk and the servants was almost comical, but it was still kind of nice to see it at times. We seem to live in a world without much in the way of good manners anymore.

I'm sure that much has been written on the details of the series already by other reviewers, so I don't think there is much I could add there. So, I'll just say that this is a great series to watch and well worth the time required to watch all the episodes.

There was a continuation series that aired recently which I did watch well before I got far along in the old series reviewed here.  They don't seem all that related to me now that I have seen all of both. The new series was not very popular and didn't last very long. Two short seasons maybe. I thought it was OK."
4939,767087372,4,"It was long ago when I followed on TV this saga, unfortunately missing many chapters and I always wanted to acquire the collection once it became available in DVD format. When I found it in Amazon I did not hesitate, went along and bought it. British works of art like this one are worthy to keep, review them once and again and leave them then for one's children."
4940,767087372,1,I mistakenly reviewd downton abbey instead of this one  poorly. I loved abbey and everything I said there was meant for this one.
4941,767087372,2,I love the series but the last two season DVDs have errors in them and ruin the episodes.  I hope to get them replaced or a refund
4942,767087372,5,"I didn't get to see this when it first ran on TV. I've always heard how good it was and addictive to watch.
I found it very good and addictive - 60 hrs is a lot of watching. I really let some housework slip until it was done.
I was ready for the story to continue!"
4943,767087372,5,So glad I own it now. Better than new series made in the 2000's. Captivating storyline that you just want to see the next one.
4944,767087372,5,"Satisfied with the timely delivery. Wonderful series, Amazon always accept returns and I had no worries. Expensive yes...but not for all the entertainment and such a wonderful series...I would buy again and may have to since my friends borrow series ALL THE TIME  Thanks Amazon.."
4945,767087372,4,I told you I liked it so don't waste my valuable time with your stupid review requirements....no no no no no
4946,767087372,5,"The dvd discs were in perfect condition and we have been watching episodes regularly.  Good thing it is summer so we can stretch out the showings until Downton Abby's next season is available.  It was interesting to see the parallels between the two shows and how much Downton Abby derived its premises from Upstairs Downstairs. ( and improved upon them).  We also enjoyed ""Call the Midwife"" which was just as well done."
4947,767087372,5,"we all like to nosey in to others' business and this gives us the perfect opportunity;I admit I enjoyed it.
Unfortunately the set  I got had alot of background noise on it, but I muddled through regardless!"
4948,767087372,5,"As a fan of Downton Abbey, I decided to revisit Up Stairs,Down Stairs.  I found it to be just as enjoyable.  The added adventures of Thomas and Sara were great!"
4949,767087372,5,Purchased this with a birthday gift card.  I never watched the series when it originally aired so I figured this was the best way to watch it based on my schedule.  A great series and a must see.
4950,767087372,4,"I looked online to see if I could get DVDs of past seasons of Upstairs/Downstairs and was disappointed to find that the first version that came out was so badly rated. I realize that reproducing something from a TV show from awhile ago may not be the high quality we are used to these days with high definition, but to look like someone ""filmed it while it was playing on a TV screen"" was a real turnoff. I was very pleased with the quality of this later version from Acorn Media."
4951,767087372,5,"I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed Upstairs, Downstairs.  The characters are true to life for the era they were portrayed in.  The loyalty of the upstairs to the downstairs and the reverse was wonderful to watch.  The actors were excellent.  I completely got the feel of the way they lived and why they had their roles to follow and followed them flawlessly.  There were one or two exceptions but those belonged to the storyline.  I would recommend these videos."
4952,767087372,5,Saw most of these in real time back in the day and it's a treat to visit again.  The precursor of Downton Abbey and worth a look.
4953,767087372,5,"After watching all the Downton Abbey that was available, I ordered this set and have really enjoyed it.  I would recommend it to anyone that is hooked on Downton Abbey"
4954,767087372,5,"For years I was hoping to one day be able to see this series.  I have been watching for a few weeks and I am almost finished.  Watching Downton Abby gave me reason to order it now.  I must say this although it has nothing to do with my purchase, While watching Upstairs, Downstairs I realize how many similarities with Downton Abby......hmmm Never-the-less love Upstairs, Downstairs."
4955,767087372,5,"Somehow I never really got into this when it played on Masterpiece Theater back in the 70s. However, since I am such a fan of Downton Abbey, I thought I would give it a try. And I am so glad I did. It begins in 1903 when there were still horse drawn carriages and strict rules of decorum, and goes through WWI, the roaring twenties, and into the Great Depression. I found the families very enduring, both upstairs and downstairs, and their struggles very real. You will love the characters: Mrs. Bridges, Ruby, Mr. Hudson, Rose, Edward, Sara, Thomas, Fredrick, and Daisy, and last, but not least, the Bellamy family and their friends.

It does not necessarily have a happy ending, but it is a satisfying one. I will be sure to watch this series again and again. I think it gives a good insight into the history of the time as well as telling an enduring story. It shows the decline of the noble class in England, how it began and came about. That was a little sad to me because I think we lost something of elegance and grace along the way to progress, and I could not help feeling that I wished we had at least some of it back. All in all, this is a very good series. I wish there had been more of it. I would have liked to seen what happened to the characters during the Great Depression.

The newer, more modern, series is also good, but sadly it was not renewed so it really does not have an ending, happy or otherwise. I was really looking forward to see how England survived WWII. Perhaps they will rethink the decision to cancel it and bring it back. These, like then, are hard times we live in, and it always helps to see a good drama to make you feel better."
4956,767087372,5,"This complete series starts in 1903 and ends in 1920, featuring a family who lived in a great house in England ~ the lives of the people living upstairs and the completely different lives of those who lived below stairs."
4957,767087372,2,"Slow, slow, slow - not what I've come to expect from British television.  Looks like they've come a long way since this series!"
4958,767087372,5,"I am enjoying getting a good idea of customs, and waynof living in London.  Only starting to see the second serie and happy that now is in colours."
4959,767087372,5,"We enjoyed this series when it was on, but did not see all the years.  We have really enjoyed this, after seeing Downton Abby."
4960,767087372,5,"THESE DVDS WERE PURCHASED AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY WIFE, HOWEVER THEY HAVE BECOME A GIFT FOR THE TWO OF US,SINCE SHE HAS GOTTEN ME INVOLVED WATCHING THEM TOO. WELL WORTH THE MONEY WE BOTH LOVE THEM AND WISH THERE WAS MORE TO STORY. THANKS MUCH-----R.J.LOUIS"
4961,767087372,5,"I did not get the chance to see the Upstairs, Downstairs while it was on TV.  I am excited to start watching this complete series.  My friends and I are planning a weekend party to watch as much of the series as we can.  We enjoyed the Downton Abbey Complete Series so much, that we just had to have this set to Party On."
4962,767087372,5,"This was a find!  I always loved the series on Public TV but missed a lot of the episodes, so I am having fun watching the whole series!"
4963,767087372,5,"This isn't Downton Abbey, but better in some ways.  The characters are great!  There are five seasons to watch!  This was TV at it's best in the 70's and is still wonderful!  Highly recommended!  Surely worth the investment."
4964,767087372,5,"A wonderful series great for a rainy weekend cozied up with cups of tea and occasional sherry. Marvelous cast, wonderful story and lovely nostalgia if you saw the original."
4965,767087372,4,"This series is not a happy one because it documents the unraveling of a family.
but at least one character has a happy ending."
4966,767087372,2,"One DVD of series 1 will not play at all.
One DVD of series 3 has loud noise in background"
4967,767087372,4,A good fill in to watch while waiting for more episodes of Downton Abbey to be released . . .
4968,767087372,5,"I'd heard of this show years ago and never gave it much thought, however, with our beloved Downton Abby away until next January (utter torture!) I thought I'd look into Upstairs Downstairs. I was a little reluctant due to the low-budget quality of the show, but I'm so very glad I decided to continue watching. The stories are so engaging...my goodness, I had gotten hooked immediately! I'm so sad that I've come to the final episode...goodbye Mr. Hudson!"
4969,767087372,5,My wife in particular enjoyed the series when it first ran and she liked immensley this past time as well. Her favorite series or shows arer period series - she is a big fan of Downton Abbey as am I. We have no complaints or any displeasures with our purchase of this product - everything we expected -- no downsides. Your service was great - thankyou.
4970,767087372,5,"A thread runs through every season of Upstairs Downstairs tying the characters, and stories together in five seasons of continuity. This is the best written,best acted television drama I have ever viewed.
  Where the modern day drama of ""Downton Abbey"" has characters that are cold and stiff. The writers of Downton Abbey leave out the humanity and underlying connectedness and dependence they all share with one another.
  The writers of ""Upstairs Downstairs"" leave in the details of the human relationships that the characters have, as they act out the scenes.
  An innate understanding of the characters is displayed, by each actor playing their part. A full picture of each character is revealed in scenes that show the characters motive, thought process, and conflict. A real understanding of human nature, class structure, and culture was known by the writers of this Magnificent piece of television history.
  When one watches these stories you can see the heart, the soul, the humanity of the characters in the story. The show is not written pandering to one class or the other class, such amateur writing you will not see in Upstairs Downstairs.
  What you will see are the trials, the laughter, the heartache, and love that both; the servants below and the Lords above go through in their journey  through life together. When the series ends you come to an understanding that these people all of them shared a life, with all of its ups, and downs, that they loved and relied on one another, just like a family does."
4971,767087372,5,"I loved it so much, I wish it could have gone on and on.  I became so engrossed by the characters.  It was so much more than I expected. I never saw it in the 70s, and always was curious.  I am thrilled to have had the opportunity to view this series.  I will watch it again."
4972,767087372,5,came quick and good packaging. got it for my mom and she loves them! came wrapped and all discs were clean and new!
4973,767087372,2,Overacted. Direction felt over the top. Acting felt forced and very staged..  Awkward.  Watched 3 episodes and stopped.  Very disappointed.  No Downton Abbey.
4974,767087372,4,No so sure this is the WHOLE story.  Some series did not follow so well like there has been some edited??  But on the whole i enjoyed it very much.
4975,767087372,5,"We truly are enjoying this series. and see how well it relates to the current ""Downton Abbey""  currently playing on Public TV."
4976,767087372,2,"I was disappointed with this expensive purchase.  A few very good actors, but mostly over acting by the rest.
It seemed they thought they were on the stage.  Also the first few were in black & white, due to a strike by
technicians.  I wish I had my money back on this one.  I could not wait for one of the servants, Alfred, to be
killed off.  James, the son upstairs, was a very poor actor.  Normally I love everything the Brits do, but this
was one big exception."
4977,767087372,5,"If only current TV shows could be like this!  When there is no baseball, football or college basketball to watch, we don't have to settle for The Biggest Loser or Survivor, we can watch this!"
4978,767087372,5,A lot of the same themes as Downton Abbey.  Some scenes definately caught me by surprise - especially given the fact that it was created 40 years ago.
4979,767087372,5,"Excellent drama, with a unique and historical prospective. A must see for every British Theatre lover. The new remake not as good as the first"
4980,767087372,4,Loved the story... one DVD had an issue with music playing through the disk.. had to not watch it.  Otherwise loved it.
4981,767025385,5,"There are so many wonderful stories of immigrants who struggled and overcame poverty to achieve greatness in some field.  Irving Berlin's life experience is eloquently captured in this excellent biography.  The Russian Jewish boy who left his impoverished Lower East Side New York family to avoid being a burden and became one of the greatest American composers of popular songs, songs like ""Alexander's Ragtime Band,"" ""Easter Parade,"" ""White Christmas,"" and ""God Bless America,"" is the subject of a most inspiring story....There is only one minor correction I would make: the box of the A&E DVD says the running time is ""approx. 100 mins.,"" when in fact the program runs about 87 minutes."
4982,767025385,5,"Comprehensive and interesting bio of America's Songwriter, especially to those interested in standard popular music, the style of which is generally no longer being produced, written or appreciated. As good as some of today's music is, can most people really easily hum or whistle any of the score of a ""Phantom"" or ""Les Mis?"""
4983,767025385,5,An excellent video!  It follows you from Russia to the streets of New York to Broadway to Hollywood telling you of the genius of this Song Writer of the Ages. It's 100 minutes of entertaining education!
4984,767025385,4,"I agree, Irving Berlin was a brilliant songwriter, and A&E always does a nice job with their biographies. But he didn't write ""Yankee Doodle Dandy,"" as is written in another review- that was George M Cohan. For a wonderul portrayal of George M, get the movie ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" starring Jimmy Cagney- and you thought he just did gangster movies..."
4985,767087372,5,"we enjoy the series, as it is timeless in its culture and way of life among the Edwardians.  We learn more about the early 1900's with each viewing."
4986,767087372,4,"I'd been hearing about Upstairs Downstairs for years. Somehow I never saw it when it was aired on PBS and the discs were a bit pricy for a 'hope it's good' purchase.

Finally I found this 40th Anniversary set -- produced by Acorn -- at an irresistible price and took the plunge.

My wife and I sat down and watched episodes 1 through 3 and each of us had the same reaction. What was all the fuss about?  Upstairs Downstairs seemed to be a mediocre, low-budget, Brit sitcom and nothing more. We took a few days off and then decided to give it another go. And are we glad we did! For starting in episode 4 the entire feel of the series changed from a cheap sitcom to thoughtful human drama.

Okay, the ""cheap"" feeling stayed for somewhat longer. Only as the years went by did the production values start to go a bit upscale.  Never near the level of something like Downton Abbey, mind you, but good enough to become invisible.

The production and mastering of the Acorn set is so-so at best, both as to image and sound quality and the interface. (Oh, the junk you have to sit through on each year's disc one before the program starts! Ugh!) And instead of defaulting to having no subtitles 4 out of the 5 sets defaulted to subtitles on. Grrr!

But the drama itself is the thing and all that technical stuff pales into insignificance once we got absorbed into the characters and the stories. This is human drama as real as life -- full of the complexities, ambiguities, triumphs, joys, disappointments and sorrows of real life and told with feeling and an underlying appreciation for what it means to be human.  As such Upstairs Downstairs is highly recommended."
4987,767087372,5,"By the time you are into the middle of the first year of this series, you have fallen in love with the Bellamy household, both upstairs and downstairs.  You care so much for each individual!  And you learn so much about the history of the times, from WWI to the Spanish Flu, labor strikes and the Titanic, and the eventual breakdown of the ""class"" system."
4988,767087372,5,Wonderful series - I first watched it when it premiered and have always wanted to see the series again.  Excellent!
4989,767087372,5,Wonderful series. We were so sorry when it ended !! The next series is not nearly as good :(  Sorry to say!
4990,767087372,5,"Really very awesome series,  I am glad to own it as I did not get to see all when it aired, so have really enjoyed being able to catch up on it"
4991,767087372,5,"This was my Christmas gift to me, and I just finished the last episode.  It is interesting to think about the lives of our ancestors and to place oneself into the storyline.  Hard to do without a Dowager Duchess!"
4992,767087372,5,"I caught the modern remake (set in World War II) and really enjoyed it, so thought it would be interesting to see the original and get the series' back story. I got this complete series for a Christmas present (yes, from Amazon!), and watched it every evening til finished! The characters and the storylines really drew me in. I couldn't wait to find out what new challenge or adventure awaited the characters in the next episode.

The series was filmed more like a play than what we are used to with a TV series today. Very occasionally the actors flub a line, or some other mishap occurs that clearly wasn't part of the script. But the actors just carry on. Makes you even more impressed with the quality of the acting - no retakes back then! Adapt and adjust!

At first I was a bit concerned I wouldn't be able to get past the ""play-quality"" of the series. For what we are used to today, it all seemed a bit stiff, but I stuck with it, and am very glad I did. When a major and much-loved character died (no spoilers from me, but if you've seen the show, you know who I mean!), I was bawling along with the actors!

It's an old series and technology and production standards back then were different than what we are used to now. But I believe if you enjoyed the modern remake, you will enjoy this."
4993,767087372,5,Bought this after a friend's recommendation.  Love Downton Abbey and this series is equally fun -- Copper is another if you are into time period adventures.  How is it that BBC can put these together so well?!  Enjoy!
4994,767087372,5,An interesting look into the British class system and how each class deals with particular social and political issues. I'm a fan of British period dramas and this series does not disappoint.
4995,767087372,5,"I thought Upstairs  Downstairs was all I expected it to be.  I a seventy five and had seen some of the origional episodes but that was years ago.  It was a pleasure and a great experience to see how the Upstairs and Downstairs occupants ran their daily lives.  What I loved was the story first, but the costumes and way the homes were decorated and conducted.  Can't wait until the the third series of Downton Abbey comes out in the American version."
4996,767087372,5,We have watched several of the discs and have enjoyed each and every one.  So far there was only 1 disc that had minor blips which perhaps in total was only a minute or so.........we have found the picture and sound quality (so far) to be wonderful and have no complaints whatever.  I nearly didn't purchase this because of some of the reviews but am so very glad I did.  We are enjoying this wonderful entertaining series very much.  I might add that We are using a very cheap DVD player which we were told to buy when some dvd's that had been copied didn't play well on our more expensive unit.  I would definately recommend this to anyone!~~!!!!!
4997,767087372,5,"Our family is a huge fan of Upstairs, Downstairs, and of course of Downton Abbey now.  But this one is the classic, and my mom enjoyed watching the entire series from the beginning at her leisure."
4998,767087372,5,"bought this item as a gift for someone that I know who will absolutely adore it!! My favorite series of all times, at a great price"
4999,767087372,5,Mu husband saw all of these on PBS long ago and really wanted to see them again.  He is enjoying them just as much as the first time amd now I get to see what he was talking about.  These will be cherished forever in out household.
5000,767087372,4,"thank you amazon. I missed the series when it came out, and it was impossible to buy the full series any other way. It's great, I feel I know all the characters"
5001,767087372,5,"i am so addicted to upstairs,downstairs(downton abbey is such a ripoff). best if you watch it for hours straight, jean marsh is the best"
5002,767087372,1,I don't hate it!  I want it very badly and hope that whatever is holding it up will work itelf out.
5003,767087372,4,"I got this for my mom, after she had mentioned it on the way to her chemo therapy treatment.  I did not plan on really watching it, or expecting myself to be drawn in, but I was.  I was so drawn in I had to get a copy for myself.  Great stories, amazing acting, and really timeless lessons.  It can be really be watched by the whole family."
5004,767087372,5,"Terrific series, enjoyed before on PBS and enjoying again. Brought back memories of characters which are gone now. Splendid acting, can't believe it's been 40 years ago. A MUST for anyone who hasn't seen the original series."
5005,767087372,5,"This is an older BBC series, but very good. It is enjoyable to watch and one becomes absorbed in the storylines. As always the BBC does an excellent job with the sets, material props and costuming. I would recommend this to anyone"
5006,767087372,5,"I started watching this on TV, but there seems to be a problem, in that they are not in order, so I purchased the 40th anniversary series and I absolutely love it, which there were more, love it"
5007,767087372,5,"I bought this set five years ago.  In between going back to college and raising grandchildren, I finally got to sit down and begin to watch it last week.  To my dismay I found that one of the DVD's was not in the case.  Since I just opened it, I assume it has always been missing. Be sure to check your boxed sets carefully!

I had forgotten how delightful this series was.  I remember watching it in high school when it was first run in the US in the 1970's.  I loved it then and I love it now (just wish I had that missing DVD)."
5008,767087372,5,"truly one of the finest pieces of entertainment-great acting and captivating story. It is addictive and you will love all the characters,good and bad. As much as I now love Downtown Abbey,this is superior."
5009,767087372,1,"The series was most enjoyable but the quality of the DVDs was very poor. I was very disappointed, it caused me to miss large segments of the story.  Wish it could be returned!"
5010,767087372,5,"I have enjoyed renewing this experience. It takes time to ""hear"" the accents and to start to comprehend the dialog. Been having fun introducing my wife to to this British saga. Brings home the differences between the 1% and 99%."
5011,767087372,5,"I havn't actually watched the whole series, but when I used to watch the series on PBS I really enjoyed the  show, that was the reason for my wanting to purchase the complete series. I also love British movies and TV.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Upstairs-Downstairs-The-Complete-Series-40th-Anniversary-Collection/dp/B004H0ZHD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Upstairs, Downstairs: The Complete Series - 40th Anniversary Collection</a>"
5012,767087372,5,"I watched this when I was in my early thirties.  Then and now, the British characters in the 1800 's, wealthy aristocrats and life revolving around Parliament, was interesting and amusing at times.  These stories put you through all emotions.  The characters are quirky but real.  The real scenery and real indoor settings are wonderful to look at and see how their lives must have been.  The dresses alone on the ladies are works of art. But this time, 30+ years later, I was joined by my husband who years ago couldn't understand why I watched this series.  He got involved with the stories and characters and enjoyed the entire thing.  It was nice to have someone to share the 'I wonder what's going to happen next' with.  I can only say, make yourself sit down and start watching the first set in the series.  If you are not British, you need to pay attention to the speech to not miss what is going on and what was said.  Have fun....and I guarantee you will have trouble keeping yourself from watching all the episodes too fast for fear the whole thing will end."
5013,767087372,1,"CD quality was poor.  many of the cd's had skips, the some did not work at all. I wonder if i was sold a returned product?."
5014,767087372,5,Looking forward to viewing this entire series during my husband's Monday night football TV and the endless Philidelphia Phillies baseball games..
5015,767087372,1,"This Ddvd set is deffective.  I should have read the reviews and not purchased it.  The first CD doesnt work at all.  You cant watch the shows because they pause and freeze. The first show doesnt play at ALL.  The second plays some, then pauses and freezes.  You cant restart it or forward thru a frozen part.  You cant advance to the next chapter either.  Its just frozen.  The 3rd show ( last show on first disk ) also froze within the first minute.  If you let it sit and try to wait it out to see if it will continue playing and jump past the freeze, it does, only to a different chapter and is still frozen.  No voices at all on the 3rd episode either ( probably because its frozen the whole time )  The whole first disk is garbage and unwatchable.  The whole first season is frozen. ( that would be the first 12 dvds ) As far as the next 4 seasons ... i haven't got that far yet, but it appears the whole thing is garbage.  DO NOT BUY!!!!!  SO far out of 12 dvds, i haven't seen one episode!!!!!  Save your money.  I am so dissapointed i wasted my money on this.  BUYER BEWARE on this one!!!!!"
5016,767087372,5,"Hello, could anybody who bought these DVDs tell me if they are subtitled in English or other languages (Spanish, Portuguese, Italian or French).

Thanks!"
5017,767087372,3,"I had some problems with the DVD set sent, but they were good in exchanging it and then eventually refunding my money.  I'd try them again and appreciate the quick response in refunding the money."
5018,767087372,5,"Several of the discs do not play on either of my DVD players.
The content and extras are excellend.  I would like a new set that plays on my DVD players."
5019,767087372,5,Why did I wait so long to enjoy this classic of classics? This is the basis for all the mini series we have available now. The most addictive television I have ever watched..Get ready for a wonderful ride..Mrs Bridges! Mrs Bridges!!!
5020,767087372,5,"Arrived in good shape, was exactly what I ordered at the lowest price available.  Have enjoyed viewing the series chronologically and with the added features.

Highly recommend it to anyone interested in British period television."
5021,767087372,4,"I didn't see any of the episodes when they came out many years ago. I'm very surprised how much ""Downton Abbey"" seems to be patterned after ""Upstairs, Downstairs"". Well worth the price!"
5022,767087372,5,"Being an avid fan of Downton Abbey, I decided to buy Upstairs Downstairs. It was made much earlier than Downton and on a much smaller budget, so it's like comparing apples and oranges. I found 'Upstairs' to be as entertaining though and have even ordered the latest series which was produced a few years ago.

I would give it a 'Buy' recommendation!"
5023,767087372,5,"Haven't actually viewed the entire series yet, but the buying experience was great.  Received within a few days and in perfect condition. Looking forward to viewing all the extra material that is included with this version."
5024,767087372,3,"How is it the 40th anniversary collection of this Masterpiece classic does not have subtitles for the hearing-impaired? This show deserves a 6 star rating, but the subtitles are MISSING."
5025,767087372,5,"Since enjoying the second season of Downton Abbey, I chose to order the 40th Anniversary Collection of Upstairs, Downstairs.  I have especially enjoyed this ""first"" series of the lives of the aristocracy and the people of service to them in the late 19th and early 20th century England very much.  The characters seem ""real"", sympathetic, and of various personalities giving credence to the story line.  I regret not having seen the original series of 5 seasons, however, it is so much fun to watch 3 or 4 episodes at one sitting.  I highly recommend this series of PBS dramas."
5026,767087372,5,"I only saw a few episodes of Upstairs Downstairs when it first was broadcast in the U.S. all those years ago, but always wanted to see more. I finally bought the complete collection this past December and watched episodes daily until the end. I was not disappointed. What a delightful series this is, still as fresh and entertaining today as it was more than 40 years ago. I so enjoyed my little nightly sojourn into the lives of the Bellamys upstairs and Rose, Hudson, Mrs. Bridges,Edward, Ruby, etc. downstairs. If you like ""period pieces"", early 20th century history, wonderful character development, great acting, and good stories, you will love this series."
5027,767087372,1,"My husband got this for me for Christmas (on Nov. 30), so of course I didn't open it before Christmas.  Then after Christmas it was a busy time and we didn't actually open it and try to view it until weeks later, when we found we had a BIG problem.  We had no picture at all on the first disk -- just talking! (Maybe this is why it was on sale?) We've been meaning to try out the other disks to see if they also are defective, but since we've learned Amazon will NOT let us return it, there's no rush to do this. BIG disadvantage of using Amazon.  I think we'll go back to brick and mortar businesses, where you can go in and talk to someone and they'll help you out if the product is defective."
5028,767087372,3,"The picture quality of this version is better than the earlier version, but not anywhere near as good as the original broadcast.  It has been cleaned up with the result that some of it looks too bright, which is almost as annoying as the blurry version released earlier.  Also, the picture on my copy freezes up at least once during most of the episodes I have watched so far, often so badly that I have to restart the episode and skip that part.  I checked it on two other brands of DVD players and it froze in exactly the same place every time.  Watch it soon after purchasing so you can return it if your copy freezes up as mine does."
5029,767087372,1,"I ordered the 40th anniversary edition of Upstairs Downstairs and received it 2 days ago. When I put in the first disc to play, it had no picture, sound for about 2 minutes - then, nothing. I printed a return merchandise label, drove to a UPS office and sent it back yesterday. I also ordered another copy of the same series and paid to have overnight delivery. Imagine my disappointment when I put in the first disc and it did the same thing as the other order. So, now I have to print ANOTHER return label, make ANOTHER trip to a UPS store and send IT back. Makes me wish I hadn't ordered the 2nd copy, but I really wanted to see the series since I so enjoyed watching my order of Downton Abbey."
5030,767087372,5,A brilliant portrayal of British aristocracy told against a backdrop of history. I enjoyed it now as much as I did 40 years ago.
5031,767087372,3,"One disc was broken in the package.  Wonder if I could get just the one replaced?  Even if not, I have had many hours of good program."
5032,767087372,5,"I like the original version of Upstairs, Downstairs a lot better than the 2010 revival. The original Upstairs, Downstairs is a classic and it has a sophisticated feeling about it. The BBC didn't do a good job reviving Upstairs, Downstairs. The BBC revival doesn't live up to the original. The cast of the original is better than the cast in the BBC revival."
5033,767087372,2,"I ordered this Collection for my mother for Christmas, with the understanding that the DVDs had closed captioning.  Unfortunately, the closed captioning does not work, several people has tried to no avail, and my mother is unable to hear the show, with the British accent.  If that problem can be resolved, I know I would be giving it a much higher rating."
5034,767087372,5,"A great ( post) Victorian soap opera. We watch an episode every day at tea time - it makes us feel we' re actually at  Eaton Place and living the experiences of the  Bellamys and their wonderful staff downstairs.  If you' ve enjoyed theForsyth Saga or the Duchess ofDuke Street, this is a must!"
5035,767087372,5,"I purchased this as a gift for my mom.  She used to watch and enjoy the series when it originally aired, but only saw the last couple seasons, so this was the perfect gift!  loved it!  The complete series in one package plus bonus material....all for a reasonable price.  Very pleased with my purchase and my Mother's favorite Christmas gift this year!"
5036,767087372,5,"My mom loved this series when it was on PBS and I would love to get this for her as a gift.  She is almost deaf, and cannot watch tv unless it is closed captioned.  Please someone let me know.  I would hate to purchase it and find out  she is not able to enjoy it."
5037,767087372,1,"We love this TV series, and my wife was very excited when I gave her this complete set of the entire series for Christmas. Two episodes and untold bouts of frustration later, we are ready to return it and get our money back, all because of the idiotic default programming that I assume was created by Acorn. From the main menu, if you click ""Play,"" you find that the default setting to play the video is with English subtitles. The audio is already in English, so these subtitles would be useful only for the hearing-impaired. Why would a setting for the hearing-impaired be the default in the first place?

So you just go to the setup menu and change the setting to ""no subtitles,"" right? Wrong! It's almost impossible. There seems to be no way to return to the main menu unless you turn the DVD player completely off, remove the DVD, turn the machine back on, re-insert the DVD, and then hit play -- and even that doesn't always work. At one point I completely removed the DVD and turned off the equipment; yet when I restarted it, the DVD resumed playing again where it left off; subtitles and all.

I finally did get the subtitles turned off for Episode One after over 30 minutes of effort (and I am very equipment-savvy). But on playing the second disc we discovered the same problem: ""subtitles on"" is the default. For the third disc, I turned the subtitles off from the main menu before hitting ""Play,"" but it didn't take -- the disc still reverted to ""subtitles on."" After finally getting the subtitles turned off for that disc (and I still am not sure why it finally worked); I decided to take the time to go through all the discs and change the setting to ""subtitles off"" so we wouldn't have to worry about it again -- but before wasting any more time, I figured I'd better check the first disc again, just to make sure the setting was still ""subtitles off."" Incredibly, it had reverted to the default of ""subtitles on"" -- so, even if you do turn off subtitles, you have to do it again every single time you play the disc!!

My wife really loves the series and has decided to keep them and just endure the subtitles. But I will never watch them, and I will NEVER buy another DVD produced by Acorn!"
5038,767087372,5,"I could not help but love this set. I grew up watching the original TV series in the UK every Sunday (or was it Saturday) evening at 8.30pm on London Weekend Television. The picture quality was as you would expect for the age  of videotape (early to mid seventies), but no worse than I remember from the Television broadcasts. I have not completely finished viewing all episodes as yet, but There are an extra 25 hours of special features: time allotted to catch up with some of the original actors, to see what they look like of course and hear their reminiscent comments about the series. The set includes all five of the original series. For quality of drama it can not be eclipsed; even if you are not old enough to remember the original TV series, it is worth a buy. I tuned in recently to the so called 6th Series - all of 3 episodes (or 2 depending in which country it was screened), and I would advise anyone who has seen these to view this set as beter by a factor of 10 - what I am saying is don't be put off if you were not impressed by the recent (6th series) come-back attempt - this is much better! happy viewing."
5039,767087372,5,This is a great series. It was a Christmas present for my wife. She has been glued to the T.V. for the entire week!
5040,767087372,5,"I'm a big fan of British tv, even though I'm American. I had a feeling I would enjoy Upstairs Downstairs since I enjoyed the new version as well as other similar shows. It took me a few episodes to get into it, but having finished the first full DVD I have to say I'm thoroughly addicted.

As for the quality of the DVDs, they seem quite good. It's a nice set over all, and I was very pleased by Amazon reducing the price for a time to $77. Excellent!

Another favorite Brit tv show to add to my collection."
5041,767087372,5,"My Girl Friend wanted this for a Christmas Present, Oredered and it came very Quickly , Have not seen it it Yet , Do not open till Christmas, Happy with the Mail time"
5042,767087372,5,"This is a real classic, and I highly reccomend it, I will Caution however, the series had not gelled yet in the first season, and I'll rate the first season at 2 stars, except for a few episodes, which I will rate at 4 stars; Starting with the second season I would rate it at 6 stars if allowed, there are super plots and acting.

Buying the whole set is well worth the price"

Everything from the clothing to the furnishings to the timely activities take you over many years and many relationships.  You will laugh, cry, be happy and sometimes sad as things change.

5045,767087372,4,"I just finished watching season one and enjoyed every minute of it. Worth the price. Don't miss the chance to see an intelligent, interesting, witty masterpiece theater. Delicious...."
5046,767087372,5,"One of those video  series  you cannot stop watching.  We watch it, put it aside, and pull it out again another time.  Once you begin to understand the characters, you really get hooked.  The entire series is the way to go!"
5047,767087372,5,"Indeed .. this brilliant, classic series of the 70's remains absolutely unbeatable in every sense of the word. Even the most recent 3 episode series could not measure up to the original script and characters. It wasn't all that bad .. just not all that great. I so loved the ""Entire Original Cast and Settings"" .. if I could wave a magic wand and kinda do a little SyFy time travel .. you can be sure .. I would head directly to 165 Eaton Place in London."
5048,767087372,5,"A trip down memory lane with some people we know very well.

Service in getting the boxed set was amazingly quick."
5049,767087372,5,"LOVED it!!! I watched this on Masterpiece Theater and was hooked. Had to have it! If you are a fan of the show, this one will not disappoint! The cast, scenery, acting and writing were all superb! No wonder it is nominated for so many Emmys!!! Looking forward to the next installment!!!"
5050,767087372,5,"I am a big Upstairs fan. I watched the series in the 70's. I think the most outstanding attribute it has is the clash between the classes of the servants and the masters. The masters feel they can do many things that are considered immoral in that society if they conceal it from the public. Everyone in both classes did their part to maintain the status quo. There were few people in the middle class. The main thing I wish I would have known before purchase is that some of the early episodes are in black and white. This was due to a workers' strike which I fully support. I would have bought it any way however.
The series is a close look at Edwardian times; a short ten year rule. Yet many earlier Victorian morals are still in play. It is a lot like an historical novel in that it depicts the sinking of the British Titanic, the explosion of the German Hindenburg, the sinking of the American ship the Lusitania by the Germans, and WWI in general which affected everyone's life at the time. It was later explained that the ""flappers"" of the Roaring 20's didn't want to fall in love or be serious in any way because they had seen so many of their friends and lovers killed in the war and knew there was no use in believing in a future. I think perhaps the Viet Nam War explains the behavior of its Flower Children in the 60's.
The acting is superb. The writing well done. There are different writers and directors for different episodes. The commentary done by the actors, writers, directors and a person who envisioned the concept is most interesting. I think valuable for young writers and film makers. All in all it is a most enjoyable series which I have seen twice now and intend to watch a third time before putting it away for a year or so.

5051,767087372,4,"I have debated a while before buying this as I had seen some of the episodes when it first came out. At that time I was a nurse working shifts and we didn't have a recorder in those days.
I am so pleased to have this series -- nostalgia and history win with me every time and I have not regretted buying this -- not one bit. I also liked the extras you get with the set, it is nice listening to Jean Davies describe how the idea came about and also listening to writers, producers was, as I found, very interesting. As for the stories themselves -- each episode could stand on its own -- although they do follow. You meet delightful characters and also there is a lot of pathos, I have cried a few times -- and laughed. If you enjoy well written, well acted, stories about Britain's past then buy it."
5052,767087372,5,"Let me first begin by saying that I remember watching Up/Down when it first aired 40 years ago, as a then vulnerable and impressionable young lass of 17. I enjoyed the show immensely, it was really rather a first offering of PBS, then known primarily as a fledgling ""artsy"" station, presenting this hitherto unknown British series through WGBH in Boston. From its first episode, Up/Down oozed quality in every way: superb acting, writing, direction, production, with the added bonus of Alistair Cooke's introduction, while seated in a leather armchair next to a roaring fire prior to each episode, to the accompaniment of the famous Masterpiece Theatre theme, Mouret's Rondo, which added to the understated elegance and anticipation of each episode.

 The characters of Up/Down were many faceted and always interesting, not merely presented as one-dimensional, i.e., rich versus poor. One could even sympathize with the clueless and wealthy Bellamy family on occasion, theirs was a cocoon of privilege and comfort, yet their breeding never eschewed vulgarity or crassness, but embraced kindness, concern and responsible humanity toward their Downstairs ""family"". Similarly, their Downstairs family, in turn, showed respect, warm feelings of pride of service and true concern for their ""upstairs"" family as well. The viewer was entwined in the lives of both ""families"", experiencing their joys, sorrows and frustrations. All within a 25 year framework encompassing the Victorian and Edwardian ages, culminating in the death of Edward VII, the sinking of the Titanic and loss of Lady Marjorie Bellamy, World War I and its aftermath, the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression, forever changing the world of the Bellamys first shown in 1904. Up/Down is, simply, a breathtakingly unforgettable series.

This 40th anniversary release is equal to the many superlatives written on these pages of reviews. I had VHS taped some of the original Up/Down episodes when they were re-shown on PBS in the 80's, which I still have. However, I wanted the DVD version, and decided to purchase this 40th anniversary set through Amazon.  Let me say that it is simply superb in every way.

The episodes have been remastered to splendid effect, they are all excellent in both video and audio quality. I do not understand how some of the reviewers could state that they are not! They are all exceptionally good.  There are 21 DVD's in this set, with an added 25 hours of extras, narrating the making of Up/Down,interviews with many of the characters who are still living, and they seem to enjoy reminiscing, sharing many little unknown facts about the particular episodes being presented. Priceless. There are also narratives and commentaries in the episodes by some of the actors, scene selection, and an enclosed brief written narrative by Jean Marsh, one of the co-creators who also portrayed Rose, the under-house parlor maid. The audio commentaries by the actors and writers on each episode are great fun, listening to Jean Marsh and Simon Williams' comments give one a marvelous insider perspective. This is the definitive collection, it just doesn't get much better than this. I urge all Up/Down devotees, new and old, to purchase it. Also, the price on Amazon is about the lowest I have seen anywhere. It is well worth the price for this timeless and iconic series, presented as grandly as the series itself. Don't miss it."
5053,767087372,1,"This series is awful.  The sound quality is so poor, you can't understand what they are saying.  The acting is poor.  I would return it if possible."
5054,767087372,5,"Absolutely, a first rate transfer of a video production from the seventies.  At times on some of the close-ups, you'd swear you are watching HD!  Being a TV photographer I can assure you, this is the best quality you'll ever see of a videotaped series.  To be honest, I'm really surprised how good this set is.  A couple of the early  episodes are a little soft, but the rest of the discs, more than make up for them.  A classic, with superb acting and great writing.  Buy this set....it's ""Upstairs/Downstairs"" at it's best!"
5055,767087372,5,"I enjoyed this show and wish it had gone on.  I watched five years worth in one month.  The captions were a boon, allowing me to catch all the dialogue even when the accents were thick.  The bonus material was interesting; the actors were so identified with their parts that  often the public refused to call them by their rightful names.

  I plan to watch it again in a more leisurely pace. The contrast between the lives of the servants and their employers was remarkable. Social situations change, but in many ways remain the same.

The actors are great, the writing exceptional making for terrific entertainment.  I recommend Upstairs Downstairs without reservation.  (The  picture looked great on my HDTV.)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Upstairs-Downstairs-The-Complete-Series-40th-Anniversary-Collection/dp/B004H0ZHD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Upstairs, Downstairs: The Complete Series - 40th Anniversary Collection</a>"
5056,767087372,5,"A real CLASSIC!  Gave this as a gift to my mother, and she is totally entertained by it.  Another wonderful british show!"
5057,767087372,5,I gave this set to my wife for her birthday as she hadn't seen it. We watch a couple chapters of an evening. The acting is marvelous and quality of the DVDs if perfect.
5058,767087372,5,"For those who like British drama, one cannot find much better than the series entitled ""Upstair Downstairs"".  It protrays a fictional family and their servants living through the peaceful times of the 1910's, through WWI, and on until the early 1930's.  It is a great story and wonderful acting and directing.  The characters are truely believable and ""alive""!  My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the series, and have recommended it to our friends."
5059,767087372,5,"This was definitely worth the purchase price since we had never seen the program. The bonus features were intriguing, but putting the garden interview between Simon Williams and Alfred Shaughnessy on disk three was a spoiler since they talk about a plot twist before its time. For those who do not know the show: don't watch this until the end. The subtitles were greatly appreciated."
5060,767087372,5,"I love these DVD's.  I loved the show when it was on back in the 70's and am enjoying it again.  I never did see the first season, so this was a first viewing of that season.  The quality of the video and audio is excellent.  I especially enjoy the commentaries done by actors and screen writers about making the series.  My only complaint is that the first DVD of each season forces you to watch previews of other collections for about 5 or more minutes before getting to the program you want to watch.  They are the same on each DVD so once you have seen them, there is no need to see them again."
5061,767087372,5,"This is one of the best television min-series that I have watched. It is one of those shows where you feel that you know the characters personally. Set in pre WW-I London, there are funny and sad episodes capturing the different emotions of people from different classes. For me, my favorite characters were Mr. Richard Bellamy, Lady Marjorie, Mrs. Hazel Bellamy (Upstairs) and all the characters (Mrs. Bridges, Mr. Hudson, Rose, Edward, Ruby, Sarah) from Downstairs.

This set has subtitles, but the diction is clear and easy to understand. Overall I'm glad I brought this set."
5062,767087372,5,"Upstairs /Downstairs is pure delight! The quality of the film is excellent with the 1st few episodes in black & white due to electricians strike back in the day. All other episodes are in color and the acting is very well done. I highly recommend purchasing this one of a kind item.
Happy in Homosasa, FL"
5063,767087372,5,"I can't remember ever pre-ordering a DVD boxed set - or anything else - on amazon. But I so enjoyed this series on PBS years ago, that I took the plunge and pre-ordered this 40th anniversary collection.

Buyer's remorse? No way! I'm in the midst of hours of enjoyment going through this set in order, watching the episodes, the commentaries, the interviews, the special ""Making Of .."" programs, and the other included extras.

I find the video quality of these DVDs to be at a minimum acceptable, and often excellent. But then, I don't expect that a TV series shot on a modest budget in the UK in the 1970's on videotape, can be transformed into a fantastically hi-def TV experience on modern DVDs. I never saw the old A&E DVDs, which I have heard were of disappointing quality, so I can't compare these DVDs to those.

At this point I'm about half-way through the fourth season, the World War I episodes. And looking forward, after I finish writing this review, to heading back to the living room to watch another episode this evening.

Just because this subject came up in a prior review: I have had no problem turning on (and off) the subtitles (aka closed captioning) using the onscreen menu of my Blu-ray player."
5064,767087372,3,"As I have stated in many of my reviews, with technology changing so fast wait. Right now there is Blu-Ray, coming is 3D, so what are we supposed to do with all the expensive sets we have already bought? So far the current 3D Blu Ray players do not say they will play your current standard definition DVDs."
5065,767087372,1,"I was so excited to get this anniversary edition at a good price.  The first set arrived and the subtitles did NOT work.  I returned and received another set very quickly.  Amazon's exchange/return process is very efficient.  Unfortunately, the second set's subtitles did NOT work.  I've sent this set back as a defective product and expect a 100% refund.  Are any of you having the same issue with the subtitles? I order from Amazon all of the time and this is the first time that I have been disappointed."
5066,767087372,1,"I was unhappy with the film quality of the Anniversary Edition of ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" so I sent it back for a refund.  Because the package was opened, I received only 50% of the purchase price.  How could I find out about the quality of the film unless I opened the package.  It should have been noted that this dated, poor quality DVD collection was not up to being viewed on a high definition television.  In addition, the sound quality was below par."
5067,767087372,5,"We have loved Upstairs Downstairs since it first aired--40 years, can it be that long?  We own the complete series on tape, but now that we are no longer young, we will repurchase this release because of the subtitles, which add so much enjoyment to Americans for British programs.

Unlike many other reviewers, we care little for bonus material--give us the meat and give us the subtitles.

Now if they would re-release Jeeves and Wooster and Rumpole of the Bailey with subtitles, our cup would runeth over."
5068,767087372,5,"Best TV series ever.  Had every episode on of all things VHS, so very excited that I will be receiving an entire DVD collection at a reasonable price.  UD is and will always be the best television show EVER."
5069,767087372,5,"My research indicates the American telecast's commentary by Alistaire Cooke that opened and closed most episodes is not included.  This is a real shame, as anybody who saw the original U.S. broadcasts will agree."
5070,767087372,5,"Yes!  The episodes are restored, and they look gorgeous! At last America can say goodbye to the previous shoddy looking dvd release, and enjoy this series as it was meant to be seen.

The extras have all been ported over from a UK release, and they are thoroughly entertaining...25 hours worth!  We get cast/writer/director commentaries, a documentary with wonderful interviews for each of the 5 seasons, the 25th Anniversary documentary, ""Upstairs Downstairs Remembered"", interviews from the 70's with British interviewer Russell Harty, and most exciting of all is an alternate version of the first episode, with an alternate ending.

My only carp was that there is not an episode guide included, but there is a written essay by star Jean Marsh.

This release was worth every penny to me."
5071,767087372,4,"SUBTITLES IN ENGLISH ARE MANDATORY IN THESE SERIES. While we watched our current DVD collection, it was not a particularly satisfactoy experience. For us the audio was the main problem, considering the british'pronunciation and not the best audio quality transfer it was really difficult to follow and thus a pitty, and I could say it was nearly a wast of money.  We love ""Upstairs, Downstairs""-- I would like to repurchase it if and only if the new version comes with english subtitles."
5072,767087372,5,"I watched the entire series, plus every rerun when it was shown in the US in the 1970s and loved it. I decided to treat myself with the boxed DVD set since the actors in this series are so perfectly cast and like family. They are one of my go-to DVDs when I need a Comfort Food story to look at. I especially love the period when the Bellamy family and the downstairs family are going through WWI; Mrs. Bridges & Ruby going to a War Cookery lecture and making ""Win the War Pie"" for the servant's meal; it is nearly inedible to all but Ruby & Mrs. Bridges. So many wonderful moments and the series comes to the right ending. The film has faded to a degree, but pretty much looks the way I remember it in the 70s when first shown here. I'm so glad to have it in my collection, for I will be watching it over and over. Thanks for the memories."
5073,767087372,5,"We own the previous complete series release of this show, ""Upstairs, Downstairs,"" which we purchased by accident at the time. What we were looking for was the British sitcom ""The Good Life"" (""Good Neighbors"") and my husband couldn't remember the name of that show. He thought maybe it was ""Upstairs, Downstairs."" After receiving ""Upstairs, Downstairs,"" it became immediately obvious that this was not the show we were looking for; it's not even in the same genre. However, we quickly became engrossed in the settings, characters, and situations of ""Upstairs, Downstairs."" Though not technically a comedy, there are definitely funny moments. As a period drama series, it is exceptional. If you've never seen the show and are, for whatever reason, considering purchase of this series, DO IT. You won't be disappointed."
5074,767087372,5,"A TV gem period series. This 27-year span epic won 9 Emmys, 2 BAFTAs, Golden Globe & a Peabody Award, 31 nominations. The aristocratic Bellamy's of 165 Eaton Place, London, live upstairs over the downstairs clockwork servant aid led by butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson). Classic Edwardian masterful plots in this funny and dramatic back time-travel over 3 decades inside the Bellamy house. A crowning British achievement in the 70's and worth owning today.

Sir Richard Bellamy MP (David Langton) and Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) have heir Lt James (Simon Williams) and Miss Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett-`A Bit of a Do') who need quite a crew downstairs to keep their house in order. Mrs. Bridges (Angela Brddeley) cooks up a storm, while maid Rose (Jean Marsh, co-creator) helps keep linens and affairs tidy. The pilot (an alternate plot pilot available) introduces new servant Sarah (Pauline Collins), who adds saucy spice to the house on both ends of the stairs. Footman Alfred (George Innes) who quotes Bible, Perce (Brian Osborne) is lady's-man coachman during carriage years, Thomas (John Alderton) chauffeur in later auto episodes. The star studded cast is endless.

This new release provides 21 discs in 5 solid cases all in the anniversary storage sleeve. Quite an improvement from the earlier release. 68 episodes, each about 50 min. Add 25 bonus hrs and you have a value, not to mention the dynamic dramatic entertainment including romance, mystery, drama, historical significance, humor, suspense, & more. Episodes 2,3,4,5,&7 are B/W due to a technicians strike. Pilot was remade in color. The features + bonus time total divided by the current Amazon price makes the HOURLY entertainment cost less than $1.87. A VALUE!

SUBTITLES-THIS SET OFFERS SUBTITLES. Helpful for some of us.  A Jean Marsh memories insert is included and created in Oct. 2010.

SERIES 1: 1903-09, introduces cast, Bellamy house trials, scandal, love, and the delight of seeing the wonderfully differences between the working and upper classes. Great plots in every episode, too many to list. Always sub-plots, upstairs and downstairs. Delightful set and an array of costuming that shows both the upper and lower class dress of the times.
SERIES 2: 1908-10, shows life with a newly married Bellamy, potential fatherhood, and romance downstairs too. All scandalous in high society, as is several topics this show dared to address in the 70s. Cast members playing Sarah and Thomas would eventually marry in real-life.
SERIES 3: 1912-14, the period finds Kind Edward VII is dead and pending war. World war and politics are just a fraction of the turmoil found at house 165. Love upstairs and downstairs is as treacherous as the war trenches. Reason enough for this seasons' best drama series Emmy & Golden globe.
SERIES 4: 1914-18, the Great War is happening, and it touches the Bellamy house stairway ends. Another 2 Emmys won due to struggles with soldiering, war efforts, changes in lifestyle due to war, and love at all times. A fine dramatic, but historical look at WWI, on the London home front.
SERIES 5: 1919-30, the largest span of time. War's end. The 1920's roar, and that impacts the family upstairs as well as the lively help downstairs. But even war fails to change some things, like scandal, family disgrace, celebrations, and again the outstanding drama series Emmy and the prestigious Peabody Award.

After the airing of ""The Forsyte Saga"" (a must series also), Eileen Atkins and Jean Marsh dreamed up the ""Upstairs Downstairs"" concept. Jean stared as Rose in the 70s TV blockbuster, and now continues that role in the continuation of the story on Brit TV (Dec '10). 3 episodes advance the story now to 1936, with a new cast (excepting Marsh) and also now including Atkins as Maud, the same house, same music, same title. After ""Upstairs Downstairs"" the pair of actresses combined again in creating ""The House of Eliott"", another period saga, bloody good Brit drama, an absolute must own ""complete collection.""
There you have my lengthy opinion, but so much in this anniversary edition. Worth the price. My final recommendation: BUY ""Upstairs Downstairs 40th Anniversary Ed"", ""The Forsyte Sage"", and ""the House of Eliott."""
5075,767087372,5,"I bought the complete UD series some 5 years ago and the money that I paid was well worth it. I will not buy the 40th Anniversary series because the extras the set offers can be seen on You Tube. If you have never bought the complete set,and have never seen UD, I suggest that you invest the money for this great piece of television history. You will not regret it. British drama is the best there is. The writers and production values are magnificent. I can understand why this program crosses all cultural lines."
5076,767087372,5,"One of the most successful British television dramas, ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" became one of the few english programs to attain global recognition, garnering an impressive seven american Emmy awards when it originally aired between 1971-1975. Most Americans saw the series when it ran on local PBS stations and later cable's A&E channel, while Canadians viewed it via the CBC.

 The series dealt with the rich and the poor and as any lover of soap opera knows when you pit these two types of people together fireworks will ignite. Indeed a soap, ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" dealt with the rich Bellamy family living in the high class Belgravia neighborhood in London. Their lives were intertwined by their servants who lived ""downstairs"" and who wanted to attain the richness and social standing of their employers. World War 1 was the backdrop for the serial which only added extra drama to the show.

 ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" is known as the series where many Hollywood leading ladies received their start, most notably Jean Marsh (who had a hand in the creation of the show) and Lesley-Ann Down, most famous for her role in ""North and South"" and currently starring in ""The Bold and the Beautiful"".

 This beautiful box set contains 21 DVD's featuring all the show's 68 episodes and has a plethora of extras that include over 25 hours of never-before-seen footage! The bonus features include a 5 part documentary called ""The Making of ""Upstairs, Downstairs"", 24 episode commentaries, interviews with cast members, and more. Sadly, when the producers went into the ITV archives to clean the show's original prints it was discovered the pilot had been ""wiped"" which was the custom for many British shows in the early seventies.

 The first two seasons of ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" (known as ""series"" in Britain) will be available individually with the release of the entire series box set. The remaining three seasons will be on store shelves before the end of 2011.

 The series has been revived on the BBC as of late 2010."
5077,767087372,5,"This series was recommended by a friend (I missed it on TV).  I have thoroughly enjoyed watching it.  It has some history bits, and gives a view of the ""genteel elegance"" of England.  It has been very educational!  And it also has romance, humor, drama.....  very good.  I heartily recommend it for watching during the long, cold winter!"
5078,767087372,5,"A wondeful series but there seems to be some gaps of time in the sequence of the recording of this program. Small parts of time that's makes the veiwer wonder how the actors arrived at that point. These gaps make the veiwer feel that the CD set is not a totally complete recording of the series.
  It is still worth the money to veiw what has been saved to CD of Upstairs Downstairs."
5079,767087372,4,"Great collection. Book-like cardboard case goes on the shelf. Quality of the transfer to disks is top notch. Audio and visual quality are great, just like the original. It is a classic, lots of fun to watch."
5080,767087372,5,"Video came in ""New"" condition as specified & came sooner than expected which was great as it was a Christmas gift.  :)"
5081,767087372,5,"possible PBS' most respelendent series, even though  it approaches soap opera in many respects, Upstairs, Downstairs brings rich slices of life alive from about 1903-1930.  my only reservation is that the tapes do no include the seminal critiques of the immortal and unequalled Alistair Cooke.  Many times they were as  enjoyable and valuable as the shows themselves."
5082,767087372,5,"I won't go into many details about the series, since it is so well documented in the other comments, but I wanted to write a review to encourage anyone who is only thinking about buying the Upstairs/Downstairs series to do it!  When the series was airing in the '70's, my mother would often talk me into watching an episode or two with her. It was almost as much fun watching how much she enjoyed the show and wanted to talk about it.  So now years later, I took the plunge and bought the whole series. My husband and I, while watching the first couple of episodes, noticed a couple of episodes were in black and white (found out later that it was due to a workers strike going on at the time), but in general the quality never distracts from the story.  We got absolutely hooked on it, and the question was always how many episodes can we watch today?  You truly get attached to the characters and miss them when they're gone.  Unlike American TV, most times indiscretions and misbehavior come at a price. I love the subtleties imbedded throughout, and the wonderful humor. I enjoyed learning British history in such a personal way, not just regarding the relationships within the class system, but also of World War I, some British politics, and life in general at the turn of the century through about 1930.... all from the British perspective. Another enjoyable feature of the series was that so often they required its audience to ""fill in the blanks"" of what sorts of things must have happened in-between scenes or chapters of the story, rather than droning on about endless details that would be obvious (typical fare in most movies nowadays).

A reunion episode is included which helped to tie up some loose ends about the Upstairs/Downstairs story development and characters.

The Thomas and Sarah episodes are a nice way to gently say good-bye to the whole Upstairs/Downstairs experience, as from time to time, there is a touch of its story that intertwines with the previous series, but also stands in its own right with entertaining stories."
5083,767087372,3,"I never saw Upstairs Downstairs when it came out originally but have very much enjoyed watching each episode in this box set.  I would just like to agree with those who were unhappy with the quality of the prints.  The coloring is greenish, print faded and a little ""antique"" looking and the sound is not very clear.  They look like what they are--old TV episodes from the 70s.  I'm sure this is a series that would benefit from being remastered and sharpened up and when that set comes out, I will buy it again!"
5084,767087372,5,A very enjoyable series. A must have in any British collection for devotees of Masterpiece Theatre. Extremely entertaining.
5085,767087372,5,"I first enjoyed Upstairs Downstairs when living abroad in the '70s.  Frankly, there is nothing shown today on American television that is remotely as fine a series as this one.

These were the final days of the British Empire and the family portrays the last vestiges of a different way of living in early 20th century England.  The upper classes DID live quite differently than your family or mine. This series  allows us to hear the gossip 'downstairs' in the servants' areas and to peep in on the privileged lives led by the family 'upstairs'.

I wish this series, or one similar to it, would be reprised.  I sorely miss the fine acting, story lines, period costumes, speech, manners, and entertainment of this bygone era.

There are occasional moments when the sound is not perfectly clear.  However, don't let that prevent you from so many, many hours of pleasure."
5086,767087372,5,"Upstairs, Downstairs is a show that is completely unique, compelling and addictive. Even being over 30 years old, it is still as good today as it was then. It is also extremely accurate in the logistics and history of the time period the show is set in.

Given the age of the show and technical issues of the time, the DVD quality is good. There was a strike in Britain at the time causing several episodes to be shot in black and white. Those episodes did not air in the US during the show's original run as PBS only wanted to air color episodes. As a result, a second, slightly different version of the pilot episode (originally in black and white) was reshot in color specifically for PBS. The original black and white episodes that were omitted were later aired on PBS in the late 80s as ""lost episodes."""
5087,767087372,5,"I FEEL COMPELLED TO EDIT MY REVIEW.  I have watched the entire DVD set.  It has been a wonderful joy watching this show.  It is one of the greatest television dramas of all time, and easily the best ever within its genre.  But the quality of the DVD transfer here is, while often ""passable"" as I originally stated, is at other times downright awful!  The sound is bad.  The picture quality is often worse!  Such a legendary show deserves the best technology and care when being made into a DVD box set, and I do hope that the owners of this material one day invest the money and effort to do it.  I'd be first in line to buy such a product.  But again, its such a great show that even watching a poor transfer brings great joy.

And now, here is my original review....

I recall my parents watching this wonderful program when I was a child.  Last autumn it was announced that all new episodes were being made and that Jean March would be reprising her role as Rose.  I thought I would buy and watch all the episodes in advance of the 2011 release of the new series.

First, let me say a word about some of the low reviews here, which give this DVD set only one or two stars.  All of them say the same thing.  They praise the series but are greatly disappointed at the video transfer quality.  I will ignore the transfer quality issues in this review.  It probably could have been better, and I hope one day a more definitive version is released.  But most of the time its not bad, and in fact more than passable.  If there were a separate rating system for the technical qualities of old TV shows being transferred to DVD, then that's where this DVD set would probably not score high.

Well, having made those initial disclaimers, I guess I don't actually have a lot to say, other than this show's writing is brilliant, its acting is superb, and it captures the early 20th century so perfectly.  Its a series full of warmth, hilarity, intrigue, and suspense.  I have just finished watching the 16th episode with my wife and each episode seems even better than the previous one."
5088,767087372,4,"Brilliant view of the social history of England  (and probably of many other countries in Europe) in the early 20th century.
The only reson for 4- and not 5- star rating is the picture quality and the lack of sub-titles."
5089,767087372,5,"This is not dated, it is a wonderful saga of the early 1900's and the changes that happened in the relationship between upstairs and downstairs as a result of WWI, I watched it in my early 30's and now I am in my early 60's, I love and appreciate it more. The quality of the furniture and decorating is almost distracting but the acting is so wonderful it all meshes into a sophisticated, enjoyable watching experience."
5090,767087372,5,"I'm delighted with this beautifully produced ""Megaset"" of one of the first Masterpiece Theater series shown in North America -- now a great classic of TV series drama. I cannot in any way fault the picture or the sound quality of this beautifully written and wonderfully acted treasure trove of entertainment, which I'm so happy to own now, these nearly 40 years after I first saw the series in the 1970s. The episodes are more beautiful to me now as I have aged and grown in wisdom and experience. This is, by far, certainly the best entertainment value I've ever experienced. The writers, producers, cast and crew of this shining jewel of stagecraft have every reason to be very proud indeed to have taken part in bringing this work to us all.  I urge anyone who has or has not seen it to see it now."
5091,767087372,5,This is the second request for a review of the same purchase.  If you had read it you would know that I was completely satisfied with the item and the service. This second request? Not so much!
5092,767087372,5,"If you are a fan of British productions, this is a great set to have.  You get absorbed into the time period, characters, and how the ""Downstairs"" interacts with the ""Upstairs"".  The characters are all very down to earth--some likable and some not.  I very much recommend this set!"
5093,767087372,3,"I'm not sure if it is the inherently poor (relative to modern standards) audio quality of a series shot on videotape in the 1970's, or just my lack of comprehension, but I have found most of the episodes I've watched so far (about thirteen) to range from reasonably intelligible to almost complete gibberish. This is due to the variety of fairly thick British, Irish, and Scots accents. At least one episode -- I think it's titled ""The Swedish Tiger"" -- left me scratching my head trying to figure out exactly what had gone on. The plot was convoluted enough that understanding everything that was said was necessary to grasp more than the basics of the action, and I think I may have gotten every fifth word. It's very frustrating."
5094,767087372,5,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas and we began watching it shortly thereafter. Initially I was discouraged with it because the first episodes are terrible. But my wife persisted and after six to eight episodes it began to get considerably better. Within ten episodes we were enjoying it a great deal. I think it was because the first episodes were lacking in pathos and charm, the writers trying to keep things a bit dark like an American soap opera. But when they gave that up it took on a life and personality of its own. The first segments (which were filmed in black and white) also had a stagey quality almost like burlesque where the actors overact to convey their emotions over great distances (unnecessary on the small screen obviously). I also had trouble with the son, whom I don't think is quite as strong an actor as the others (such as the actor who plays the butler Hudson, who is excellent) but he gets better as the series progresses.

Other actors come and go making a slow but steady evolution toward a very enjoyable ensemble series."
5095,767087372,4,"I, like other reviewers, found some ""unique"" audio and video effects to be a bit distracting - the series starts out in color, then to switches to black and white, then back to color. I am left to  wonder, primarily based upon the fact that it started out in color and immediately went to black and white, if the producers ""assumed"" the series would be short-lived, therefore it was not cost-effective to continue filming in color.  There are a few other video oddities sprinkled about - a strange, albeit very small, bar that reminds me of the ""this is a test"" signal bar one sees (or used to see) on the old analog stations - it was usually up in the top right corner, noticeable only because I suspect I was paying keen attention to such things given some of the other reviews.  I worried my new TV was experiencing some color/tone issues, but when I moved the same disc to another TV/DVD, same thing.  None of these ""issues"" are deal-breakers - but I must admit I was a bit disappointed that with all the amazing editing tools used these days, no one felt it necessary (or worthwhile/cost-effective perhaps) to ""clean up"" some of these little items.  The audio quality seems to ebb and flow - sometimes crystal clear, other times I found myself rewinding to replay - now, these audio snips could have been less than crystal clear simply due to the location of the particular scene (e.g., racing scene, outdoors vs. indoors, party scene with many ""chatters""), still, not a deal-breaker......besides, it's not as though this series was recently filmed :)

The series itself is wonderful - lessons in social classes and the economic impact thereof remind me of history lessons - without the homework :)  The attention to the smallest period details is impressive, from clothing to cookware, from food to architecture, from healthcare (or the lack thereof really) to amenities such as transportation and communication, ""someone did their homework"", and I appreciate the effort (the historical research,and recreations, must have been an significant undertaking unto itself).

The Thomas and Sarah ""series"" leaves me indifferent - if anything, it seems to be a rather disjointed collection of the two main character's ongoing achievements followed immediately by some sort of horrible failure - somewhat predictable (make some money, lose that money, secure a job, lose that job, find some lodging, lose the same). However, both are fine actors and the same attention to period details carries over in this ""mini series"" - a nice ""bonus"" feature, but on it's own, I'd say this series would garner a generous 3 star rating, not bad, but not wonderful.

This collection is one in which I'm sure I'll find myself watching again and again, even if just a disc or two, even out of sequence - enjoyable just the same. No regrets on the purchase and yes, I'd recommend it to others and would definitely make the identical purchase - were I offered a ""do over"" :)

Overall: 4.5 stars (the ""ding"" is due to the video/audio ""issues"")"
5096,767087372,5,"I decided to buy this boxed set because I always loved the series, but had not seen it in it's entirety in over 15 years.  It sometimes runs on PBS, but I wanted the set for viewing in my time slots...not someone elses.

While they aren't as sophisticated as modern day DVD's, they are true to the original series I saw on PBS.  They were filmed in the 70's, and that's just the way it is.  Even the black and white ones were great and I thought yhey were of good quality for viewing at home.  I couldn't tell the difference between watching PBS and my DVD's, except my DVD's were in my personally created time slots.  I think they were well worth the money, and they arrived in perfect condition earlier than promised."
5097,767087372,3,"My wife and I love this series. We were young and I was in the USAF stationed in England during 3 of the years that UPSTAIRS-DOWNSTAIRS aired on live TV and so perhaps that's part of why we love it.

It's not action-based and it's not comedy-based. It explores the complex relationships of a wealthy family and the people who serve them as well as the complex and changing times in which they live, and it's very well done. Neither group is villainous but neither group is perfect. They all have their good points and all have their faults but that's what makes it so interesting to watch. And inevitably, what goes on UPSTAIRS or DOWNSTAIRS affects the other group, either directly or indirectly. It's so well done that you may have to pinch yourself to remember that these people are just actors, plus make sure to watch the 25th anniversary show about making of the series.

In the 1970s the quality of British TV video was superior to the quality of US TV because they used more lines per screen. However, the quality of the audio and video of this product is awful, just awful. It's even poor by low-def standards. It's very grainy and has wavy lines in it at times. It looks as though someone made copies from a VHS tape and you got copy number 1000. At times you hear the camera motors running, and that's on top of the British habit of allowing the background noise to overwhelm the conversation.

Sigh, but with all of the faults of the recording, we still love the series."
5098,767087372,4,"Heard about this series all my life...finally bought it..and have problems understanding dialog....cast seems to mumble at times...and at others, talk so fast with the British accent that this Southern gal has problems hearing/unstanding dialog.  love the cast... but am tired of ""backing up"" trying to get the gyst of the script"
5099,767087372,4,"Bought this for my wife for Xmas and the theme's are very good and the acting excellent but I was hoping it would be something we could watch as a family but it was not the case.  The stories deal with very mature topics.  For example just the first 5 episodes dealt with the subjects of rape, abortion, adultery and homosexuality.  This was a little too much for our children.

There were a number of reviews that gave low ratings because of the quality of the video and sound. We did not find any problems with this.  Except for a few that were not color there was really not difficulties.  It would have been nice to have caption since the varying English accents were difficult to understand at first and we had to keep rewinding to figure out what was said."
5100,767087372,5,Very well done series about the social class distinctions in England during the early 1900's.  The downstairs service staff vs the upstairs social elite.  Interesting story lines include historical references and British humor.  The characters are well developed and the acting is excellent.
5101,767087372,5,Excellent boxed set .We are enjoying the series after being fans when it was first screened..Fabulous clothes and great actors all add to the enjoyment. Highly recommended.
5102,767087372,5,"I was too young to appreciate the series when it originally aired on PBS, but I really love it now!  What a great insight into Edwardian society!  It is extremely interesting to see how life changed over the years, also.  The parallel lives of the Upstairs and Downstairs family members provide plenty of drama. I am sad it is only five seasons..."
5103,767087372,5,I bought this collection without ever seeing any episodes because I like British productions.  It is great acting and I have trouble turning it off!  I want to keep going onto the next and the next it is so good.
5104,767087372,3,"I was very disappointed to find that the series was not subtitled, as both my husband and myself are hard of hearing. We are able to follow the action somewhat but miss alot of the dialog and it is very disconcerting."
5105,767087372,5,"Upstairs Downstairs is the example par excellence of British television.  Over five seasons during the 1970s, Upstairs Downstairs riveted audiences in Britain, while in America, it more than any other series made Masterpiece Theater an essential part of Sunday evening television.

Upstairs Downstairs is the story of the Bellamy family of 165 Eaton Place, London from about 1903 to 1930.  The Bellamys are an aristocratic family with a houseful of servants.  The interplay of story line and personality between Upstairs (the Bellamys and their friends and relatives) and Downstairs (the assorted servants) was beautifully done.  Some of the episodes tended to be a bit too soap operaish, but at its best the series was utterly spellbinding and memorable.

This megaset contains every episode of the original five seasons.  Some of the transfers are not all that clear, and a few of the openings have been truncated or even omitted entirely.  The megaset also contains a spin off of the series, Thomas and Sarah, based on the lives of two of the servants after they left 165.  Thomas and Sarah has nowhere near the quality of the original series and does not, in my opinion, deserve to be grouped with it.  But nevertheless this megaset is the best way to obtain and enjoy Upstairs Downstairs today."
5106,767087372,5,"We've watched the entire series through twice and consider it the best period drama ever made, with brilliant performances, great scripts and superb production design. If you've not seen this masterpiece, you're missing something out of your television viewing life. Not to be missed, and highly recommended. The quality of this release is generally quite good though if rating the set purely on image quality, it would only be a 3 out of 5."
5107,767087372,2,"The first episode was in color.  The next episodes were in black and white.  The sound went up and down throughout each episode.  I think it was episode 21 or 22 which was repeated and the ensuing episode wasn't on the disc.  I wrote the BBC to ask about getting a replacement disc with the missing episode and never got a response.

Whoever did the quality control for this DVD set should be required to give us all refunds or at the very least prevented from ever producing DVDs again.

I bought this series as a gift and it made it look like I bought some slightly irregular box set on clearance, instead of getting a quality set like I assumed I was gifting, which was highly embarassing.  So if you're buying it for someone else, keep it in mind that they're going to be disappointed.

You'll still get to see most of the episodes, but expect that you'll be adjusting the volume throughout your viewing and don't count on watching the episodes in color, as they originally aired.  At least it's a period piece, so you can tell yourself that's why it's in black and white."
5108,767087372,4,"What a pleasure to be able to watch every episode of ""Upstairs Downstairs"" at your own pace, with NO commercials or fundraising breaks!

I was surprised watching this megaset how many episodes I don't recall ever seeing.  I'm not sure whether that's because I was out of the house at the time -- in the days before VCRs -- or because some of the episodes have elements reflecting the racism, anti-semitism, or other unfortunate aspects of the Edwardian age which U.S. networks elected not to broadcast.

At any rate, one need look no further than the brilliant first episode to see why this series is one of the best -- if not the single best -- historical drama ever, and every bit as captivating today as when it was originally broadcast.

With clockwork precision, the first episode introduces us to the aristocratic Bellamy family who live upstairs at 165 Eaton Place, and their staff of devoted servants working downstairs.  We see how the house functions, in particular the duties of the servants through the course of the day -- and we are introduced to one of the richest casts of characters this side of Dickens.

The steadfast and resourceful Hudson the butler, played by the late, great Gordon Jackson... the fastidious Mrs. Bridges the cook, played by Angela Baddeley... Rose the parlor maid, played by series co-creator Jean Marsh... Mr. and Lady Bellamy, played by David Langton and Rachel Gurney... their children James and Elizabeth, played by Simon Callow and Nicola Paget... all are indelible creations magnificently realized.

In the course of the series, the years from the first quarter of the twentieth century come to life with an unerring eye for detail, from the advent of electricity in the home to the adoption of the automobile to the crackle of the first crystal radios and early victrolas to the sinking of the Titanic to the horrors of World War I and the crash of the stock market in 1929.

Watching the series again, I was moved to tears on a number of occasions.  I felt as if I was spending time with a dear family I hadn't seen in many years.

This megaset also includes a twenty-fifth anniversary special that reunited many of the cast members to reminisce about the production.  One of the most amusing anecdotes comes from series co-creator Marsh, who recalls that there were ""upstairs"" dressing rooms for the cast and ""downstairs"".  The former had windows and boxes of tissue; the latter did not.  The Bellamy family cast were automatically assigned the ""upstairs"" dressing rooms -- until Marsh finally spoke up and noted that as series co-creator, she deserved a box of tissues as much as Rachel Gurney!

Then there is the spinoff series, ""Thomas and Sarah"", featuring the ever-scheming, never-succeeding former chauffeur and maid of the Bellamy household, which I consider more of a curiosity than a drama as compelling as ""Up Down"" itself.  Still it is a welcome inclusion for dedicated fans.

I have deducted one star for the technical problems of this DVD set, which have been cited by other reviewers as well.  A&E obviously didn't lavish the same attention to detail on the mastering of these discs as the writers, directors, and actors who created the show, and it's a shame.  Especially annoying are the little boxes of ""digital dither"" that appear in the upper right corners of many episodes, plus the nonexistent color correction in others.

Still, these technical issues detract only slightly from the breathtaking panoply of the drama unfolding here, and at a price around half that of the box set when it was first introduced, this megaset still merits inclusion in a British television enthusiast's collection.

One hopes, as others have noted, that A&E will eventually release an improved megaset that clears up these technical issues and perhaps includes another set of reminiscences from the series creators and television commentators.

Until then -- ""look sharp,"" as Hudson would say, and order this spectacular set to enjoy with your family!"
5109,767087372,5,"We missed so many of the shows when it was on television...and this was a wonderful way to see the whole series. As usual the ""brits"" really know how to make a period piece and the writing is delicious."
5110,767087372,5,"I experienced only a couple of minor glitches in the quality and that was when one of the CD's appeared to skip.  The sound quality was fine so perhaps I got one of the good sets; I don't know.

The series itself is delightful and I'm so glad that I purchased it so that I can watch it again and again.  I would brew a pot of tea, pour it into my finest china tea cup, enjoy some scones or crumpets and take myself back in time.  I became so fond of the Bellamy family and even more so of the downstairs family that when I came to the end of the series, I was sad but then, I can visit w/them any time I like, can't I?  There are many reviews here that tell of each character in the series, so I won't bore you w/all that, just will mention that each family ""knew their place"" in the class system at that period of time and there was snobbery at both levels.  I have my favorite characters, Mr. Hudson and Ruby, to name two of them and I found myself getting really caught up in their drama, especially w/the way that the cook, Mrs. Bridges, treated poor, slow, lovable Ruby.  At times I would forget that it was only a story.  So does that tell you how good the acting is?

I thought that I wouldn't like the follow up series ""Thomas and Sarah"" but I enjoyed it immensely as well.  I was, however, dismayed by the ending and while I won't include a spoiler, I will say that it, too, left me sad and wanting more.

Don't hesitate to purchase this series.  I think that perhaps the quality of the set has been much improved.  I treasure mine and I think you will as well."
5111,767087372,1,"Before I begin my review of the product, I would like to share something I think UpDown fans will chuckle at:

The other day I was watching an UpDown episode in which Miss Elizabeth joins the suffragettes and Rose is sent to Holloway prison. In one scene, one of the other jailed suffragettes attacks Rose, who falls against the wall.  I noticed how the wall moved (quite a bit); it looked to be made out of cardboard!

The 25 year Anniversary Special is very well done and very interesting.

Now for the review:

I would assume that some reading this have the series on VHS and want to upgrade to DVD.  My advice is: DON'T.  These DVDs were not remastered at all; I don't care what the description says.  The DVD set is no better than the VHS. The beginning intro (the music and cartoons from Punch magazine) is cut off in several episodes. There are numerous episodes where the tape (thus the DVD) jumped and the picture is momentarily distorted.  Images are fuzzy and the colors are off.

My last advice is if you can wait, wait a couple of years when it is the 40th anniversary of the series.  No doubt remastered digital DVDs will be produced at that time as most films are on anniversaries.

PBS will offer a few NEW episodes of ""UpDown"" in April 2011; Jean Marsh reprises the role of Rose Buck working for the new family at Eaton Place. I have heard rumors that new episodes are already being filmed, so popular was the new series.

[...]"
5112,767087372,5,"This series is one of the most engaging and provocative dramas about Victorian/Edwardian life in London. The character development is exceptional, as are the story lines. I recommend it highly."
5113,767087372,5,"This was a great production and with the addition of "" Thomas and Sara "" it is a good value.
With the tripe on tv today IE:so called reality etc. This gives the viewer an sample of what was offered during the ""golden"" age of tv ."
5114,767087372,5,"I saw this series probably about 30 years ago when I was a child. It is truly unforgettable, even though I didn't remember much about the details of the story I did so about some of the characters and some important events in the series. So as soon as I found here I decided to buy it and to see it once again.  I was not going to be bother by the reviews about the sound quality and picture probably coming from I suspect modern viewers accustomed to HD definition, Stereo sound and Surround systems I can understand their point of view perfectly.  The series after all was made in the early seventies, in fact some episodes are in black and white, some others have not a very good sound, and you hear sort of a buzzing in the back. Mind you, once you start watching this series you will forget all about the little flaws and will not know what day of the week or what time it is anymore because it is so entertaining you will spend the whole weekend trying to find out what happens next. There are perhaps few episodes you may find slow or not as great as the rest. But overall this series has everything to keep you engaged and interested for as long as it is one more episode to watch. At one point or another you almost feel as part of the cast, which is superb, they are real actors in a time when a scene was 20 minutes straight and they took a couple of takes, they had to memorize every word and breath on the page and rehearse previous filming.  It is definitely one of the best BBC productions ever made.  I don't think this beautiful series can be done again in spite all the advances we may have with sound, picture quality and special effects."
5115,767087372,5,"This is an almost complete set of the series now on DVD. Apparently, none of the series has every scene from every episode, but this one comes close."
5116,767087372,1,"The new shrink wrappped dvd boxed set arrived very promptly. Unfortunately, one of the disks was defective. Disc # 21 was the same as dic # 22. This was not the sellers fault however. I am receiving my money back."
5117,767087372,5,WE have watched the first 12 episodes and just love this collection.  We look forward to watching an episode.  We have found the quality to be very good and we are completely satisfied with this purchase and delighted to have this treasury.  The characters are so interesting and how they deal with challenging issues is priceless.
5118,767087372,5,"Upstairs, Downstairs is my all-time favorite mini-series. I fell in love with the characters. The acting is first-rate and the story is not only entertaining and engrossing but is fascinating from a historic point of view. I have seen this series a few times and have recommended it to friends. I consider this series the jewel in the crown of Masterpiece Theater's productions."
5119,767087372,5,"I bought this for my mother and she absolutely loves it.  It's a really fun series, I recommend buying the whole collection it's cheaper than the individal seasons."
5120,767087372,5,"Upstairs Downstairs is all those things that are great about a series. Because of the chance to have such length to it the characters are well developed and the relationships realistic and relate-able. So many important topics are taken and handled with grace, accuracy, and often times wit and humility. Non-consummated marriages between a young lady of class and an old wealthy gentlemen, Older lady of class in a stable marriage having an affair with her son's college friend, homosexuality, a scullery maid's suicide, the effect of WW1 had on the aristocracy ""disassembling"", the only other options for those born into lower classes who don't wish to work as servants, the effect the upper classes decisions have on the staff, the amount of work and effort the staff's lives give to the upper class.

Each episode explores with wit and with that dry way the British have of showing the severity of situations while also showing the ironic humor, the intricacies of class. But beyond all that, the acting is superb, the stories fascinating, the soap operas addicting, the costumes fun, and the history, IF you love history and you love the complexity of the class systems we as humans create, you will fully love Upstairs Downstairs. Fantastic!"
5121,767087372,5,Life for servants and upper class in turn of the century England. Contains quite a bit of history and different sides of political issues. My favorite soap opera and show of all time.

Excellent product, service, and shipping.  Wish there were more."
5123,767087372,5,We loved this series the first time around and it is great fun revisiting the Bellamy household.
5124,767087372,5,"These DVD's are great!  My mother-in-law just loves this series, says it's her favorite show of all time.  She didn't even know they were available on DVD.  You can imagine her surprise when she opened them.  She says they're good quality.  I guess some available out there are of a lesser quality."
5125,767087372,5,"Unforgettable characters! The fourth season, on the First World War, is probably one of the best of the whole series."
5126,767087372,5,"This is for those who remember this great, great series and wish to own it, and also for those who have heard about it and want to add it to their collections, but are fearful that the quality of this set may be poor.

I recently purchased this set and found the picture and sound quality of these DVDs to be perfectly fine.  If there is anything that may take some getting used to it's the variety of London accents of the characters, just as was the case in 1971.

This is a series shot in a studio for television in the early '70s, not some ""blockbuster"" film shot a year ago with 21st century technology.  But this set looks and sounds the same as it would if Masterpiece Theater reran it on television today.  It's perfectly clear all around.  If you're inclined to buy this set don't let anything stop you.  You will love every minute of it as much as I have."
5127,767087372,5,This is the best series BBC has ever done. I have watched it over and over again and feel like part of the family. They draw you into their lives and it is a wonderful series. You will not be disappointed in it. I will not even lend out mine for fear of not getting it back. WONDERFUL
5128,767087372,5,I love Upstairs Downstairs and am extremely glad that I purchased the complete set. Thanks
5129,767087372,5,"During the 1970's I was serving my country in Europe, Panama and Vietnam. When I came home in 1972 I knew nothing of this British TV Series shown on Masterpiece Theater on Public TV.  Well over 37 years later, I learned of this Series quite by accident. I purchased the complete series along with the season of Thomas & Sarah.
 This is an extraordinary compilation of the Edwardian period of English history.  The escapades of over 27 years of English history is indeed grand.  Upstairs resides the family Bellamy with all their aristocratic problems.  Below, downstairs resides the people of service led by the steadfast Angus Hudson who resided as the Butler.  The complete series covers the intrigues from 1903 to 1930.  We see Edwardian England, World War I and the roaring 20's.
 This is a classic series.  One of the best series I have seen.  It is historically correct.  The content and acting is first rate.  Technically the sound is sometimes difficult to follow.  This series deserves a five star rating.  It is indeed a classic.  The addition of Thomas & Sarah is indeed a great bonus.  Please don't miss it!!!!!!!"
5130,767087372,5,"If you enjoyed the series on PBS, this is a perfect compliment to your DVD library."
5131,767087372,5,"Although there are problems with the transfer of this series to DVD, I would nonetheless recommend the purchase of it.  Because of previous reviews respecting image quality, I just about did not buy this series, which would have been a big mistake. I have an HD TV, and picture quality is acceptable, given the era when it was filmed.  Any technical shortcomings are minimized by great story lines and exceptional performances.  Upstairs Downstairs has stood the test of time, and is as superb when it was originally broadcast.  This is classic British television drama at its best and an essential addition to any one's DVD collection."
5132,767087372,5,"Wonderful stories, each episode a delight. We are savoring them.

The image quality, while not 2008 standard, is more than sufficient. We are so immersed in the stories and the characters, that we don't even notice the '70's image quality. The only thing we're concerned about is that we might, at some point, reach the end."
5133,767087372,4,"As you have probably read there are indeed quality problems with this set. Sadly the criticisms are true and for some people will be a distraction. I found I could live with the technical difficulties and if you don't need a technically perfect digital transfer you will be rewarded with one of the most outstanding television series ever broadcast. Superbly produced, finely written and splendidly acted by a magnificent cast  of British actors who give the characters a life that will remain in your memory long after  a first viewing and going back to this set will be like visiting old friends."
5134,767087372,5,"Absolutely tops, first rate entertainment. The included bonus series Thomas and Sarah is not quite as riveting but would rate 4 stars. If you like British drama and British humor, this is the set=ries for you."
5135,767087372,5,This series was every bit worth the money.  I'm sure I'll watch it again and again.
5136,767087372,5,"fabulous series  have wanted it for 20 yrs but price too high.
still high, but i just had to have it.  acting, production, editing, all perfect.  a must see."
5137,767087372,5,"My daughter, a teenager, and I, definitely well past the teen years, discovered this series on Netflix. We fell in love with every character and couldn't wait to see what happened with each episode. My daughter was so sad when we finished the series and said that it was like having to say goodbye to dear friends. So when I found this boxed set on Amazon I knew I had to get it for her so she could ""visit"" anytime she liked! The characters are well developed and so are the plot lines with very contemporary themes even though the series is over 30 years old.  We had some very interesting conversations about women's rights, social classes, historic events such as World War I and the 1929 stock market crash. This series is so entertaining on so many different levels. We highly recommend it, and you don't have to be a fan of British t.v. or history to enjoy it. The sound quality and picture quality are good, though I did notice a slight buzzing sound on one or two episodes. This was noticed on both the discs from Netflix and from this set, so am assuming that it is to do with the original recording and not any defect on the discs themselves. However, as I stated it was only one or two episodes at most and did not disrupt the enjoyment of the program at all. We are very pleased with this purchase, not only for the quality but also for Amazon's low price!"
5138,767087372,5,Upstairs/Downstairs was a great series and having the ability to revisit with these marvelous characters whenever I want is marvelous.  I've wanted this set for years but I just couldn't afford it.  The deal offered here was absolutely fantastic and having Thomas and Sarah added in was the icing on the cake!
5139,767087372,5,"I just finsished watching my last episode and am in withdrawal!  I just didn't want it to end.  I only wish they had done an episode where they followed up on all of the characters.

Such a wonderful peephole into another way of life.  I am so glad I ignored the comments that ther were problems with the video quality- I didn't notice any so I really can't imagine what they were talking about."
5140,767087372,5,"I'm so happy that I bought the Megaset which includes the Thomas and Sarah series. Firstly, the price here at Amazon is just great. After web surfing a few other outlets, I can say this was the most reasonably priced for the entire series. As for the video quality, I think it's just fine if you remember the time when it was filmed. There was no high definition then, so for what you're getting it's well worth the investment. I love knowing I can visit with Rose, Mrs. Bridges, and Hudson anytime I'd like to. Cheers, and please pass the tea!"
5141,767087372,5,"I received my set and have watched several of the DVDs. These programs were taped in the early seventies, but I think the quality is very acceptable. I don't know what some people are looking for, perhaps HD versions of the series. This set is well worth the money. Very enjoyable and are comparable in quality to the original TV broadcasts."
5142,767087372,5,"I just finished the whole series and I have enjoyed it!!
It is the best of the British best."
5143,767087372,5,Enjoyed this series when on PBS.  Now we can watch at our own leisure.
5144,767087372,5,"I just recieved this yesterday and already have finished half the series in one LONG marathon sitting.  (It's been too cold outdoors where I am at present, not to mention the snow piles up daily, and I can't think of a better way to spend the day than with the Bellamys and their staff of domestics).  What a joy this series is to watch!  Years before, I remember watching this in rerun format on the local PBS station but haven't seen it aired since in this area.  And a shame that is!  To see them all again - Rose, Ruby, Mrs. Bridges, Hudson, Lady Marjory, to name a few - is like meeting up with family members or dear friends you haven't seen in decades.

So far, I have not run across any of the technical problems experienced by some of the reviewers for this program; I hope that remains unchanged as my viewing goes along.

With many BBC titles in my library, along w/ films set in England (such as Howards End, Remains of the Day and anything Austen or Dickens or Trollope related), just adding this series to the rest is like adding the final jewel to the crown.  In these days of numerous television reruns, writers strikes and nasty reality TV, what a joy it is to watch a REAL television series, where the characters and setting all make a difference for the viewing audience.  A history lesson, a life lesson, all in one...

Do not miss the 25th anniversary retrospective contained on Disc 4!  You can tell they knew they were part of something special and they just glow as they reminisce about their on-set experiences.  For those actors that left the series early on in its run, they sincerely regret their decision to go.

Viewers, Reap the rewards of this fantastic, landmark series!  And, Rule Britannia!"
5145,767087372,5,"Upstairs Downstairs is such a delightful program you can easily look past the television quality of the production.  Remember it was done a long time ago and did not have benefit of todays digital mastery.  So enjoy the stories,  costumes and sets.  It was certainly one of my favorite series on tv and I recommend watching it."
5146,767087372,3,"I bought this as a gift, despite warnings about the poor quality of the transfer. It is as relatively inexpensive barebones set. The picture quality  is comparable to if you had transferred your old videocassetes made 20 years ago, to DVD. Some episodes have color lines running through them. All episodes are grainy. And there are various other video flaws. Furthermore, the audio is poor - lots of extraneous noise, sometimes a sound like a movie projector running, etc. If you want a cheap complete Upstairs Downstairs with the complete Thomas and Sarah, for cheap, regardless of picture quality, this is worth it. I just find it a bit depressing that any company would issue programming of such unbalanced quality."
5147,767087372,5,"The product ordered was delivered within three days. The quality of the DVD was excellent. Thank you, Geraldine Layell"
5148,767087372,5,"This is the complete DVD set of the series and the quality of the set is just fine.

More than just tv drama, this series accurately depicts the specific roles of those given to service, and those who were served, in England during the late Victorian and Edwardian society.  While some of us in the USA may employ a nanny or a cleaning person who comes in and vacuums twice a month, the concept of a full household of servants is largely foreign to most of us.  Up/Down affords a genuine study of those in British service and is utterly facinating.

Having the complete set allows for immersion (or not) into the characters and their specific roles, especially at the lower level.  Not surprisingly, it is below stairs that the gossip... the good stuff... is discussed.  We find out what is actually going on at the lower level.  Adding to the facination is how the upper class is oppressed by their station and how they succumb to what they must suppress.

Up/Down is a great series, especially if you love all things British."
5149,767087372,4,I just have received this set.  I have viewed the first 2 episodes and it is as well produced and written as I had anticipated.  I saw none of the productions during their initial showing.  I am truly looking forward to viewing this whole series this winter.
5150,767087372,5,"This is absolutely a wonderful series.  Truly one of the best ever.  It's also a bargain, as the entire series on VHS cost just under $1,000.  Having just studied U.S. History in the period the series covers I understood even better just how well the producers and writers interwove real life events in with the stories of their characters, and best of all the characters are flawed and real and loveable and even gently amusing.  While there are some episodes (The Swedish Tiger) and some characters (Sarah) that I've never particularly liked, the series as a whole is superb.  (And as for video quality people are complaining about here, I don't get it, as I've only ever seen Up/Down on PBS and VHS copies from PBS and this looks just as it always did.)  Don't let this even bother you.  The series is worth it."
5151,767087372,5,"UNFORTUNATELY, THERE WERE TWO FAULTY DISCS---ONE WOULDN'T ADVANCE PAST THE  MIDDLE AND THE OTHER WAS MIS-LABELLED AND WAS A REPEAT OF AN EARLIER ONE. WHEN I CALLED AND ASKED FOR NEW DISCS, I WAS INFORMED THAT I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE AN ENTIRELY NEW SET SENT TO ME AND WOULD HAVE TO RETURN THE FAULTY ONE. IN ORDER TO DO THIS, I WILL HAVE TO VIEW THE NEW SET WHICH IS TIME CONSUMING AND THEN WRAP THE OLD ONE
 AND TAKE IT TO THE UPS STORE--WHICH IS INCONVENIENT. IF I SHOULD FIND FAULTY DISCS IN THE NEW ONE, I AM UP A CREEK---

OUTSIDE OF THAT, I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE SET AND HAVE ALREADY ORDERED ""THE PALLISERS"". THE ONLY FAULT IS WITH THE QUALITY CONTROL AND THE WAY REPLACEMENTS ARE HANDLED."
5152,767087372,1,"It goes without saying that ""Upstairs/Downstairs"" is a brilliant, entertaining series well worth the owning.  When Amazon offered the Collector's Edition Megaset on a great sale, I couldn't pass it up.  I didn't really remember the series well, but I knew I very much wanted to see it.  Like others, I read the discouraging reviews about the A&E Home Video transfer, but I thought, I'm not really that picky and it's probably not all that bad.  Well, I am not that picky; I don't care about things being in HD or looking like a ""Harry Potter"" movie.  That said, I want readers to know, I was very, very disappointed in the visual and sound quality of A&Es Megaset.  So much so, I had given thought to sending this set back and exchanging it for another in hopes that it might be better.  But first I did some research.  I googled ""Why are the DVDs of A&E's Upstairs/Downstairs so bad?"" and found an informative website which had a page on the US A&E version.  It made it clear that A&E Home Video had used old copies of the episodes for their remastering instead of getting new ones from the UK, undoubted a cost saving measure on their part.  As someone who has purchased many of these wonderful, older British series, I can tell you that the A&E version of the Joan Hickson ""Miss Marple""s are not terribly good either, although they are certainly better than these sorry things. I have only taken a quick look at the two Thomas & Sarah DVDs and they do appear to be somewhat better than Upstairs/Downstairs.  Hopefully, someday another company will release a quality set of the original series."
5153,767087372,5,"I've been a long time fan of this series.  I decided to purchase the whole set for my library since it is such an important mini-series.  It still holds up well today and is an excellent primer for understanding life before, during and right after WWI.  Also, it's fascinating to learn the structure of British society at the time and how much we have changed."
5154,767087372,5,"The classic BBC production of life in Victorian England was a personal favorite from the time that it first aired on Masterpiece Theater.  Now I have the opportunity to view this excellent story whenever I want.  The quality of the production, the acting, and the authenticity of the setting won awards at it's inception, and they still hold their quality today.  I highly recommend this set of DVD's."
5155,767087372,4,"Yes I have read all the reviews concerning the low quality ""fuzzy"" picture of this DVD set. I have found the remedy...just wear 3-D glasses!! Watch Hudson pop out of the screen...it's incredible!!"
5156,767087372,4,"Remember that the production of this excellent series was engineered more than 35 years ago.  A suggestion - watch on a smaller screen;  the lower quality is barely noticeable and does not detract from the excellent performances of so many gifted actors.

If you have the time, watch one disc a day to fully appreciate the character development of the main players. The withdrawal symptoms after viewing the final DVD will be worth the immense number of addictive hours viewing this incredible production!"
5157,767087372,5,"The acting, the interaction between the actors, the atmosphere - there's nothing like it. I escape into a different world every time I watch."
5158,767087372,5,"What can I say. This miniseries is great even after all these years.

I noticed some of the reviews complaining about the quality but the local PBS station in my area reran it several years ago and the quality was the same. It is a little low grade but if you have ever seen tv shows from the UK made in the '70's they are a little low grade quality to begin with. Besides, it adds to the feel of the show taking place in the early 1900's."
5159,767087372,3,"I can't say I wasn't warned.  Other reviewers of this set have remarked on the poor picture quality.  However, since I had been re-watching this series on taped VHS cassettes from a PBS broadcast, I assumed that the DVDs would be an improvement.  Wrong.  I'm sorry I threw away my tapes.  I am very disappointed that A&E would have issued this beloved series on such poor quality DVDs."
5160,767087372,2,"After two decades since watching Upstairs Downstairs, I rashly decided to buy the WHOLE set!!!!  As I watched the first episodes I realized my memory had played a scurvy trick on me! The melodrama was a bit vulgar and VERY predictable! Later episodes of the set improved, but not by much! It was like watching a biplane that didn't quite make it over the trees at the end of the runway. I hope you won't make the same mistake I did."
5161,767087372,5,"I wish I could give it a hundred stars, this Upstairs, Downstairs is absolute magic. A story about the Bellamy family and their servants, it goes beyond any kind of play or soap (quite frankly, I think it merged qualities of both quite successfully)--but it draws you INTO the family and you feel like you actually become a PART of the whole thing. Troubles? Sure always troubles with both the wealthy family and troubles with the servants. But even in real life, it always has trouble, doesn't it. Frequently very touching; sometimes even shocking; it's GREAT! I LOVE THESE DVDs! I don't give a flip what other people say about the alleged picture and sound quality ""troubles"".  I say, honestly, just WHERE are these alleged ""toubles""--remember it was made for television; in fact during some of the early season you have some black and white episodes due to some kind of technical crew strike or whatever. But it's just a few shows but WHO CARES it's all great.

I found nothing wrong with either the quality of the DVDs picture and sound. I thought the overall picture/sound is great.

BIG WARNING: ONCE YOU START WATCHING THESE DVDS BEFORE YOU KNOW IT YOU ARE ***hooked*** AND I MEAN YOU CAN'T STOP WATCHING THESE. REMEMBER I WARNED YOU.

Another great thing about Upstairs, Downstairs, is that you can watch it again and again and never get tired of it.

If you are not used to British television, well, the first disk you have to get used to the accent...but it's not hard--TRUST ME IN NO TIME YOU WILL NOT EVEN NOTICE THE ACCENT.

I really love this series. It's a real treasure."
5162,767087372,5,The first set I recieved had a terrible noise on most of the DVD's.  Some of the DVD's had very poor video.  The 2nd set are in great shape and I have found no noise or bad video.
5163,767087372,5,We enjoyed the series while on public tv and now canwatch at our leisure.
5164,767087372,5,"Bought this series for Christmas for my wife who is an avid fan; always has been-She likes Rumpole, loves Bramwell but adores Upstairs Downstairs. She's enjoying it right now without a peep as to the quality of the DVD's. Don't be deterred. Buy it. It's well worth it. What makes it even better is that Amazon sold it to me for $124.97. Now how can you beat that?

5 Stars in any direction."
5165,767087372,5,"Outstanding!  As great as the first time I viewed, over 20 years ago!"
5166,767087372,5,I have been enjoying this series very much.  The video quality of these shows on DVD is pretty good.  I was concerned about that after reading a review here but those concerns proved to be unfounded.
5167,767087372,1,"One of the very best TV dramas ever made, enjoyment of it is almost totally ruined by appalling picture and sound quality. I have no idea what ""digitally remastered"" means, if this is the result. It's a disgrace to charge almost $250 for a product this inferior. I actually thought my copy was a bootleg, made by some bloke pointing a digital camera at a TV screen -- it's that awful. There is also a constant ""shadow"" track on the audio, which sounds as if someone has a radio on in the background. Just disgraceful. Avoid."
5168,767087372,5,"I now see why many people adore ""Upstairs Downstairs,"" and also why it has its place among classic television. The whole show is actually a time capsule during the time of pre-WWI UK and after (up to the US stock market crash in 1929.) It is very interesting to note the various stages of changes that were happening during that time. It's like a history lesson but with more fun in it (apologies to my History teacher.) In this, the makers of this wonderful miniseries did not fail in their mission to make things as authentic as possible. Personally, I cannot boast about knowing much about English soceity during the Edwardian era, for my knowledge of it actually comes from period movies and television programs that I had seen before. But when I said ""authentic,"" what I meant was that we can see and feel the labour of love that was put into every detail to make the show feel at home in its period setting.

In addition, this is no ordinary soap opera because it really has a lot of things to say about many issues. One might think that the people who inhabit the stories are shallow and uninteresting. After all, what can be interesting about the lives of parlourmaids, footmen, or drawing room ladies? But then, in ""Upstairs Downstairs,"" you will find otherwise because the writers somehow managed to give the stories and the characters flesh and blood, as well as humor and tears. Though dignified as the ""Upstairs"" masters may be, the writers prove that these people are not infallible, and that they are as susceptible to mistakes as any other class of human being. As for the ""Downstairs"" servants, though they toil all day long, we see that they do have lives of their own that are also interesting.

Having said the above, I guarantee that you will root for most of the characters. I love Lady Marjorie the best; captivating Georgina, no-nonsense Hazel, and Virginia as the second Mrs. Bellamy I love second. They are such adorable and charming people. I shall never forget that scene where Lady Marjorie tells Hudson the butler that ""the King will be dining with us next week."" She was picture-perfect in that one. As for the men, I always admire Mr. Bellamy for his political convictions. Although we don't actually get to see the hearings in the House of Commons, we do get a firsthand look of what goes on behind the life of a parliament member. It is this aspect of the show that gives ""Upstairs Downstairs"" its political dimension. As for Elizabeth and James, I disliked them most of the time because they are spoiled, but they do have their human moments. Plus, Nicola Pagett and Simon Williams are such good, good actors. These two have some of the best parts in the whole series; Simon Williams, especially, as James, during the War years and after that.

Going now to the servants, there's Edward and his pretty wife Daisy. There's also Rose, who really lost a chance at the one happiness that she could have get (find it out for yourself.) Mr. Hudson, I sometimes find disappointing because of his prejudiced views. But during the times when he is in his right principles, you will admire him for it. Mrs. Bridges might be scoldy, but she really is a mother at heart, having no children of her own. It may surprise you to find out that she never had a husband. Ruby the scullery maid might be trivial, but she does have the spotlight in ""The Hero's Farewell,"" one of my favorite episodes. She also has a funny line at the final episode where she was contemplating that it won't be long before she gets the guesthouse all to herself. As for Thomas and the scene stealing Sarah, you will either like them or dislike them, but they do have their place in the story.

The last episode is a touching one, since we would have gotten used to the characters and feel that we know them already. I was sorry to see the members of the Bellamy household disbanded like that. I especially felt heart-pangs when Rose (Jean Marsh) was closing down the empty house. The ghosts of the past whispered into her ears as she did this, from floor to floor of 165 Eaton Place. These final few minutes of the show will not soon go away from your memory,.

As companions to this series, I would like to recommend the ""Berkeley Square"" Series and Stephen Poliakoff's ""The Lost Prince."" Both of these can be had here at Amazon. There is no doubt that ""Berkeley Square"" had its roots in ""Upstairs Downstairs."" To see ""Berkeley Square"" is to extend the enjoyment after viewing ""Upstairs Downstairs."" But to get a better understanding of the political situation of the time period, I would recommend Stephen Poliakoff's ""The Lost Prince."" This is considered to be one of Mr. Poliakoff's best works. I guarantee that ""Berkeley Square"" and ""The Lost Prince"" will not disappoint. Both are BBC productions.

Overall, I highly recommend the show, definitely a keeper. Some of the episodes might not be appropriate for younger viewers, as they touch on subjects about homosexuality, a murder, and suicides. The episode ""Alberto"" might also not be suitable for younger audiences, because it has an element worthy of an ""R"" rating. Other than that, it's mostly safe. The best part of the show was during the years of the War, when everybody had to make sacrifices, and when nothing was really certain. One lesson that the show teaches many a time is that WORDS CAN HURT. Parents will do wise to instill this into the minds of youngsters.

A word about picture quality: since this is a show over thirty years of age, one mustn't give it a lot of expectations. I think there's a limit of what our current technology can do in the field of DVD transfer. I personally don't mind the sometimes grainy quality (plus the black and white of the first few episodes) because it gives it more vintage. What I do complain grievely about is the lack of subtitles; and, there's not much of a bonus feature."
5169,767087372,5,"Upstairs Downstairs is just as wonderful as it was when I first watched it on PBS in its first go round. I'm just finishing up watching season three and wish it could go on forever. This is an unforgettable addition to my DVD library, well worth the cost. By the way, I can't imagine why one or two reviewers criticized the technical quality--all but the first few episodes are in color, and the picture and sound quality of all are just fine. Don't let those few complaints discourage you from embarking on an unforgettable experience."
5170,767087372,4,"I can't help myself, I just love this series.  I missed it the first go round in the 70's on PBS due to ""life events"" that were going on for me, but it is such a stellar series -- and it is so affordable in the ""Complete Series"" package by A&E that I have to tell you that despite the poor poor quality of the DVD, the stories are too fantastic to not view and own if you are on a budget.  I do notice the DVD ""panning"" or ""slowing down"" or even the fuzzy notation for the next reel in the upper right corner, but I just acknak it and let it go, and let the story and character draw me in and in and in and on and on and...."
5171,767087372,5,"Upstair,Downstairs gets you into it immediately and never lets go. It covers the lives of the ""Swells"" and the ""Help"" as they go through some of the most dramatic years of Englands history.

Their lives go on and intertwine in a captivating cascade of ups and downs, loves and heartbreak. The story includes the international happenings of the day in the most interesting format; the lives of the people who lived it.

Thomas and Sarah are the most lovable of rascals and are made for each other."
5172,767087372,5,"It is no exaggeration to say that this classic early 70's British period drama is one of the all-time best series of its sort ever produced.  With sixty-eight 50-minute episodes, the series covers a time span of nearly 30 years (from early Edwardian England in 1903, through the horrors of the First World War, and on into the Roaring 20s, finally concluding with 1929's stock market crash). The setting is the household of the Bellamy family at 165 Eaton Place, London.  Upstairs live Richard Bellamy, MP, and his beautiful, aristocratic wife, Lady Margery. The Bellamys have two adult children, Captain James and Elizabeth, who come and go much like a recurring motif (though recurring nightmare might be more appropriate, for they are the source of much grief (albeit unintended) for their society parents). I don't wish to give the storylines, scandals and surprises away. Suffice it to say that as the series progress, there are lovers, marriages, births and deaths (not to mention the arrival of a beautiful young niece) which impact on the relationships and alter the composition of the group above stairs.

Downstairs we are privy to the lives of the servants in the Bellamy household. First and foremost is the devout, inflexible and regimental head butler, Angus Hudson, the staff overlord. Then there is the curmudgeonly but good-hearted cook, Mrs. Bridges. Other memorable characters include the efficient but sheltered head house/parlour maid, Rose Buck; the religious but simple footman, Alfred; his successor, the good-natured Edward, who has an eye for the female staff; the not-overly-bright scullery maid, Emily, and her successor and intellectual equal, Ruby; and Lady Margery's prim and snobbish lady's maid, Miss Roberts.  Of course, one simply cannot forget the sassy, vivacious new under house/parlour maid, Sarah (Pauline Collins), who is a real dreamer and schemer and who, like a bad penny, turns up on the Bellamys' doorstep periodically during the first two series, or the new capable-but-just-as-conniving chauffeur, Thomas (Collins' real-life husband, John Alderton), who is nobody's fool!  Like the family upstairs, the downstairs ""family"" too has its share of comings and goings, what with lovers, marriages, deaths, hirings, and firings.

This boxed set includes the 1979 spin-off series entitled Thomas and Sarah (thirteen 50-minute episodes), which chronicles the adventures and misadventures of those two memorable miscreants after they leave the Bellamy's employ.  Unlike Upstairs Downstairs, which is fairly high drama infused with a spattering comic relief here and there, Thomas and Sarah is very much a comedy-drama.  With Sarah's penchant for foreign accents and tale-telling and the conniving and entrepreneurial spirit that both characters embody, the stage is set for some thoroughly enjoyable vignettes. Most of the episodes involve the couple trying their hands (and luck) at something new--like running a match-making agency, working in a boys' school, working as magicians, and so on.  For all their efforts, however, they always seem to find themselves skint--and thus the need for another enterprise (and hence another enjoyable episode!).  The only thing less than satisfactory is the ""conclusion"" of the final episode, which left me wondering whether or not a second series was at least anticipated.  But that's is a minor quibble, for this is a series to be watched for the sheer enjoyment of the journey.

One final dvd bonus is the enjoyable and informative 50-minute 25th Anniversary Special,  which was produced around 1998 and includes remembrances by many of the surviving actors (including James, Elizabeth, Rose, Edward, Daisy, and Ruby).

In conclusion, Upstairs Downstairs is quite simply an outstanding dramatic series.  It is compelling, captivating, and often thought-provoking; and if you enjoy a dramatic series with lots of ""goings on,"" scandal, and so forth, you'll enjoy it all the more!  The inclusion of Thomas and Sarah is a delightful, light-hearted, entertaining bonus, and I highly, HIGHLY recommend this boxed set to all fans of the very best in British period drama."

The boxed set contains all five series (with a total of 68 episodes).  Series one and two cover the Edwardian period from 1903 to King Edward's death in 1910. There is little change in the household throughout these two series, and although the entire series is spectacular, these first two sets are my favourite. Series three covers the period from 1912 to the start of WWI. Series four covers the war (1914-1918), and its depiction of the realities of war from the human standpoint is unsurpassed, making series four a very, very strong series indeed. Series five covers the twenties.

In conclusion, this is quite simply an outstanding dramatic series. I would, in fact, go so far as to say that it is required viewing for anyone who enjoys first-rate period drama. But its appeal is broad enough to be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys compelling, captivating, and often thought-provoking drama; and if you enjoy a dramatic series with lots of ""goings on,"" scandal, and so forth, you'll enjoy it all the more! It's a large set, but it's well worth taking a chance on.  I simply cannot imagine anyone not enjoying it.  Those who've enjoyed Upstairs Downstairs will surely want to check out The Duchess of Duke Street (both of which were produced by John Hawkesworth)."
5174,767087372,4,"I am enjoying this series very much.  It's been 30 years since Ive seen it so it's like seeing them for the first time,  well almost. I am very pleased with these DVDs. Some have said the transfers were bad, but I have not found that to be the case at all. The color is good and the sound is excellent so far as I've seen. After all these were made back in the 70's.  One should appreciate this set for what it represents, a much loved series with much loved characters, filmed in the 70's for television."
5175,767087372,5,"I purchased this set and have had a delightful time going back to Eaton Place. There they all are, all the people and stories I remember from back when I first discovered this wonderful series. I was totally absorbed in the lives of the upstairs Bellamys and the downstairs servants world.

  Sure, as some reviewers have said, the quality is not quite the same as a new series. And I guess more care could have been taken with matching up the characters pictures on the boxes to the episodes. OK.

  It doesn't matter. What matters is the incredible quality of the writing, the perfect casting of the actors, and the wonderful evolving of a story that spans 27 years."
5176,767087372,5,"Its not the DvDs that are bad qualty people, its the 1970's BBC tapeing, You see the same thing on any other 1970s BBC show. Lets face it, they were cheep in tapeing."
5177,767087372,5,"We really enjoyed this series. It brings doing nothing by the upstairs crowd to a new level. Great performance. Favorite is Mrs. Bridges and Ruby. What a love hate relationship. The series is worth it. Spend the money, you will not regret it, it will bring entertainment for many years to come."
5178,767087372,5,"As I type this out, PBS' Masterpiece Theater is about to celebrate its 35th birthday making it the longest (if not 1 of the longest) prime time series on their network.  Suffice it to say it is wonderful to see if the best of shows of the series (which we inherited from such British networks as BBC, Granada, etc.) showing up on DVD labels like A&E, Acorn and even their own label.  The one series that a lot of people clamour about is this one: Upstairs Downstairs: The life of the Bellamy family and their servants in a story spanning the early decades of the 20th Century.  When this series first hit DVD, it was released in 5 sets of 4 discs, and then a megaset of all 20, followed by the 4 disc set of its spinoff (not sure it was seen here) Thomas & Sarah (all of which are still available).  Now for the first time all 24 discs comprising both series are in 1 REALLY MEGA set.  I will now finally get to see in its entirety a series that I have heard nothing but rave reviews about, plus its spinoff and can watch em uncut and uninterrupted all I want.  Nice way to start the new year with this set in my home in time for it's 35th anniversary.  Buy THIS set (as opposed to the other 20 disc mega set) and get ready for the most popular series we ever inherited from da British."
5179,767087372,3,"Since I was the videotape editor on many episodes in this series (from 1970)I thought I would point out a few errors that other reviewers should be aware of.

The show was not made by the BBC.  It was produced by London Weekend Television (LWT) - part of the commercial ITV network (Independent Television) of the time.

At least the first 6 episodes were recorded originally in black and white because there was a technicians strike which demanded more for recording in colour.  Episode 1 was re-written and re-recorded in colour to connect with the first colour episode - thus making international sales possible.

Mail me if you have further technical queries about this series: david@dareks.fsnet.co.uk"
5180,767087372,5,"I have no idea why some of the reviewers are complaining about the audio and video quality of these DVDs.  Because of those reviews I almost did not buy this set.  That would have been a grave error.  I suppose, if you are some type of audio/video expert you might find a few reasons to complain, but this is a 35 year old British TV show.  If you expect special effects, buy Star Wars, not Upstairs Downstairs.  The quality of the audio and video was quite acceptable and certainly better than when it originally aired.  (It should also be remembered that the first season was filmed during a technicians strike.)

As for the show itself, Upstairs Downstairs is one of the greatest TV shows ever filmed.  It is an extremely entertaining examination of the British class system from 1900 to 1930 (particularly what happened to it as a result of WWI).  After you have watched a couple of shows, you will have difficulty turning them off."
5181,767087372,1,"I purchased the first issuance of USDS when it first came out.  I returned it five times only to find out that the glitches were in ALL production issuance.  When I heard that USDS was to be reissued ""digitally remastered"" I was over joyed.  I have made it through about one half of the series.  It has been repackaged, but don't expect an improved picture quality. SHAME< SHAME A & E for a rotten reproduction of one of the best mini series of all time."
5182,767087372,5,"To answer Anglo Fan question, this is a wonderful series that I NOW have the pleasure of owning. If you are the type of person who needs digitally re-mastered so the show can look like a gloried sitcom like Friends then this is not for you. What makes this show a classic like I Claudius, which if you check I Claudius reviews it was extremely mixed, however it is the simplicity of it is makes it so appealing . I bought I Claudius on DVD and although it has none of the glam and directing we are so use to, nevertheless it is perfect in my eyes. I have hundreds of DVD's and I am particular about what I add to my collection and this one is a gem and worth having!"
5183,767087372,5,I have seen this program on TV and loved every minute of it; truly first-class British programming. I have not purchased this newly released collector's edition or the earlier mega set because of the negative comments about the quality of the video transfer. Does anyone else (who has seen this latest edition) have an opinion? This would be extremely important to know before making such a sizeable purchase.
5184,767087372,1,"Before buying this set I would strongly encourage you to use a web search tool for '""Upstairs, Downstairs"" US DVD' and see for yourself just how bad the picture is on these DVDs. I can confirm that these DVDs are identical to the first US release of ""Upstairs, Downstairs"", but simply repackaged and repriced lower.  I own over 400 DVDs, have rented many more than that, and have never seen a worse transfer to DVD. If you must own this show on DVD buy a region-free DVD player and get one of the European sets. Not deserving of 1 star, but rather a square. Shameful. Avoid."
5185,767087372,5,"This was a wonderful show.  I like how it covered both the stories of the servants and the masters.  It also went through some very unusual times.  I'm very sick of the History Channel always playing World War II, like it was the only war besides Vietnam that ever existed.  Remember, we might not have had a WWII, if WWI hadn't been dealt with the way it was.  Upstairs, Downstairs does deal with WWI and all the difficulties associated with it, both mentally and physically from the perspective of the soldiers and the homefront.

The series also deals with themes that history often glosses over, such as the wealthy being just as prone as the poor to having affairs.  That's a theme Victorian and Edwardian society glossed over.

The only downside was this series covered about 20 years in not enough episodes.  It would have been better with maybe a ten year run, so the stories didn't skip around quite so much and certain secondary characters could be better developed."
5186,767087372,5,"As others have noted this first release of Upstairs, Downstairs had a horrible transfer to DVD (see e.g., [...] It had the video quality of a VHS tape of a city council meeting aired on a cable public access channel. Hardly worthy of one of the most memorable and beloved series in TV history.  A new DVD release of this wonderful series is coming 10/25/05.  Based upon the supplements announced with the new release, one can hope that the video in the new release will be notably better than in this collection."
5187,767087372,5,If one wants to see how the upper class use to live in Edwardian England and how it ended with the waste of World War I. Than this is the place to go to. The BBC has outdone itself with this one.
5188,767087372,4,"I don't have the US version of the Upstairs Downstairs box set, but, if the UK releases are anything to go by, they'll be very good. Technically, the picture and sound quality isn't 2005 standard...and, I suppose there will be some degradation in converting 625 line PAL colour pictures into 525 line NTSC. As regards the black and white episodes, they were NOT made by the BBC. The entire series was made by a commercial TV company called London Weekend for the ITV network. Colour production on ITV started in late 1969, but, in late 1970, technicians took industrial action, refusing to produce colour programmes. The action lasted months and every ITV programme screened or recorded during that period was in black and white. Thus the reason for the monochrome episodes. To return to the series...great in its day and still worth watching. Incidentally, Gordon Jackson, who played the butler Hudson, later starred in a series about undercover agents called ""The Professionals"". It's well worth seeing."
5189,767087372,5,"I rejoice in the technological development of DVDs which provides the perfect format for the celebrated release, in one complete box set, of one of the finest series that has ever graced, or will ever grace, TV!

This British series is truly in a ""class"" by itself. It's characters are unforgettable, the acting inspired and the backdrop evocative - Edwardian England from 1904 into the 1930s.

The story evolves around the aristocractic Bellamy family ""Upstairs"" at 165 Eaton Place, London, and their servants ""Downstairs,"" but it is not a soap opera. It is as genuine, real and honest as any period production, or for that matter, any production, that I have ever seen.

The characters grapple with the same struggles that we continue to confront in mordern-day America: love, loss, coming of age, morality, prejudice, death, economics, social responsibility, unwed mothers, change, freedom and the search for life's ultimate meaning - concluding with the horrendous effects of a World War and its devastating aftermath.

The ""master"" of the house, Sir Richard Bellamy, played with genuine heart by David Langton, is in Parliament thanks to the enormous political influence of the family of his well-bred wife, Lady Marjorie Southwold Bellamy, played with aplumb and surprising depth by Rachel Gurney.

We come to know the couple and their problems, as we witness a doomed love affair by Marjorie with an artist that she forsakes to save her mariage and which underscores the power of duty in English society. Richard learns of the affair but doesn't address it directly with his wife, whom he resolutely adores, but instead stands by her as she grieves for the one true love she has chosen to give up. Marjorie's life is cut short (the actress left the show after two seasons) after a fateful voyage on the Titanic.

The Bellamy's house parlormaid Rose Buck is portrayed by Jean Marsh, who created the show and starred throughout the series. Rose is compassionate, tough and as real a ""person"" as if she had actually been alive.

Other tremendous characters of this brilliant ensamble cast include the butler, Angus Hudson, portrayed by the late, great Gordon Jackson, the Bellamy's cook, Mrs. Kate Bridges, played by the late Angela Baddeley, and the Bellamy's son, James Bellamy, played by the gifted Simon Williams.

It is Hudson who not only keeps the house running smoothly, but is also the keeper of English social propriety and tradition, objecting to modernization and the merging of social classes. Hudson desperately tries to hold onto the society he knew and loved, but international events conspire to change the very fibre of British culture.

But, it is through the character of James Bellamy that these historical events are played out. Initially, a ""useless"" member of the young nobility, James was restless and lived primarily for himself and leisure pursuits. Uncontrollably, he is swept up in the tide that became World War I and changed England, as well as the World, forever.

James becomes an officer and sees combat and the horrors of war. James eventually returns to Eaton Place after the war ends, but is unable to cope with his ""new"" life or reclaim his ""old"" one, so he ends it by his own hand in the former safety of the family estate.

As the series ends, the Edwardian age of English innocence and ""fun"" has also truly suffered a fatally self-inflicted wound. So, it is fitting that after James' suicide it is the nostalgic Hudson who, with a tear in his eye, closes the house -- and thereby symbolically, the era -- forever.

These are only a few of the characters and events that become real in the series, which ran through 68 riviting episodes.

This unflinching look at history as well as a truly timeless, engaging family saga is not to be missed. The series was originally broadcast on PBS's Masterpiece Theatre, and was introduced each week by the late popular historian, Allistair Cooke."
5190,767087372,5,"I remember looking forward to Sunday nights in the 1970's, when Upstairs, Downstairs was Masterpiece Theater's offering, introduced by the divine Alistair Cooke.  When this DVD set arrived, I hoped that at least it could recreate the Edwardian world for me, as it did 30+ years ago.  I was wrong.  It is so much better than I remember.  With the perspective and experience of thirty years coloring the viewing, the foibles and triumphs of the two families upstairs and down are so much more compelling now.  With the underlying theme that the house must run smoothly no matter what is going on in the inside or outside world, the dependence of the two families on each other is beautifully portrayed.  The period details, down to the china patterns and the paint colors are exquisite, and the characterizations the actors bring to their parts, made possible by the very fine writing, superb.

  From the first episode when Lady Marjorie hires Sarah ""On Trial"" and gently but firmly establishes Sarah's position in the household, through the elegance and grandeur of the Edwardian era, ""There's no one to touch you, Mrs. Bridges, when it comes to lamb,"" the exigencies of WWI, when poor shell-shocked Edward the footman is cared for by Lord Bellamy; to the bittersweet end, when Lord Bellamy's diatribe when James loses Rose's inheritance in the stock market crash of 1929, causes a tragedy; the delicate balance between upstairs and down is fascinating and amazing to watch.  The pride the servants take in the successes of the upstairs family, which their support makes possible, and the avuncular care with which the Bellamys ""look after"" the servants (""I hate to see servants humiliated,"" says Georgina, when unexpectedly confronted with Frederick in an embarassing situation) make this series particularly fascinating to Americans, for whom this way of life has never existed.

  Despite bombs falling, housemaids giving birth in the attic, party guests committing suicide outside the nursery, various forms of heartbreak occuring both upstairs and down, it's reassuring to know that at 165 Eaton Place, dinner will always be served by an impeccably clad butler on impeccably polished silver, and that tea in the servant's hall will always be accompanied by one of Mrs. Bridges' delicious cakes (when she's not in a snit about being made to go to a lecture on wartime cookery).

  No, the quality of the DVDs is not the best, but given a choice between owning it, with all its glitches and jumps--and not having it available at all--I'll take it. There are no problems distracting enough to make it unwatchable. This remarkable series has stood the test of time and truly shines.  The fine writing, splendid acting and authentic sets involve the viewer in the stories to the extent that the minor jumps and glitches are unimportant.  My only complaint is that Alistair Cooke's wonderful introductions are not included."
5191,767087372,3,"OK so the BBC in the 1970 decided to produce a long runnig series of the lives and loves of the decadent Edwardian rich, only problem, most of the unions in the production studios were on strike. So, do they wait to start work on the series when all the techs are back OR do they just go ahead and film the thing in B&W with poor sound etc etc ....

Yup you guessed it .. they started the series in B&W cause the execs at BBC never really expected this series to take off.

This may have been very good and well back in the 1970's but they should have explained it to the buyers of the DVD set that the first few DVD's of this box set are in B&W and really really bad production... It took  me a while checking my equipment and the disks to realize what they did .. menu in colour and movie in B&W ... thanks!

I sort of expected the DVD set to improve after disk three when it switched to colour but, trust me you could clearly see a substandard production of the 1970's .... I guess for the purists they did nothing to fix the production with today's modern sound, video enhancement programs/computers  ... What you saw is what you got ....

OK so I am really bugged out because I bought the box sets of 'The Forsythe Saga' and of 'Horatio Hornblower' series that were produced and published by the same BBC and A&E people, so you can probably understand why I was so so disappointed with this 'megaset' .....

The three star rating on this set is certainly deserved by the writing, scriting, casting and most certainly the acting ... the directors and the producers though should be punished...."
5192,767087372,5,"So very very wonderfully done, my heartfelt thanks to all who were involved in the series.

I will never hear the name Ruby again without hearing it in Mrs. Bridge's voice.  Never!  :-)

The only thing that's wrong is that there are only 5 seasons...sniff, sniff...

I have to defer to the other reviewers; there are really no more comments to add, they've said it all. Simply the best TV series ever made.

I love the series.  Wish it could go on forever.  Sigh."
5193,767087372,5,"This is a great series, well worth watching and owning! I lilke everything about it from the characters to the setting, costumes, dialogue and story."
5194,767087372,5,"Upstairs, Downstairs is a really great show! After more than thirty years it holds up extremely well. The acting, the sets, the storyline, the scripts--everything about it is first class. It's one of my favorite TV series because it has characters and episodes that I, as a woman and author, can totally relate to."
5195,767027329,5,"Much has been said already making the quality of this dvd obvious, but I think another person listed as completely satisfied is in order here.  I cannot explain how completely eerie it is to see some of these events recorded in color.  You will never forget the scenes from the concentration camps, and how you are assured with color that these things were allowed to happen not that long ago.  The complete and utter destruction of 'modern' cities in color is so very strange to see.  Should be in every history class.  Nice to see Canadians getting recognition for their contribution too!
Incredible, eerie, mesmorizing, well-edited and educational."
5196,767027329,5,"This is the most astonishing, complete and concise documentary I have EVER had the pleasure of viewing. Worth twice the price. I am a WWII collector and I can say without a doubt that this set is a MUST for any WWII collector!"
5197,767027329,5,"If you weren't alive during WWII (and that means a lot of you) then you should see this. It has the clarity and appearance of the color footage from the Vietnam War. I'm 30 years old, and this DVD made me realize just how recently these events took place, and how swiftly they escalated. Color brings a humanity and reality to film that strikes home. Some of the scenes are quite disturbing because they're real images of real events involving real people just like us.
They did a fantastic job cleaning up the footage."
5198,767027329,4,"All the previous reviewers seem to have covered it all. This two DVD set is essential viewing for everyone. The colour and quality of these two DVDs brings to life the horror and grim reality of WW2. They give a brief and tragic insight to what it was like to experience the second global war, not only from a soldiers view point but also a civilian's one. The focus is more on the human element of the war rather than strategic or tactical view and makes good use of diary and letter extracts to compliment the unforgetable colour images.
The only disappointing feature was that the review on the back of the first DVD suggested there would be combat coverage of the Battle of Staingrad, however this coverage was merely in the form of colour still shots unlike all the other images in this DVD set.
Potential buyers from Australia and New Zealand should note that this has viewed on T.V. as ""The Color of War"" and not to confuse it with something different.
Everyone should view this DVD to get a feel and an appreciation for this particular period of time."
5199,767027329,5,"Every human being should see this documentary. The vision will change your everyday life that you realize the burden of what we have inherited from those who fought and suffered just a little over 50 years ago. I really hope that the International Versions of this film would be distributed to the rest of the world, so that everyone on this planet will have a chance to understand this legacy to teach ourselves and give lessons to our next generation.
There is especially an important piece of message here, as all the people whom experienced WWII will pass away and a whole new generation in the 21st century know nothing about.  As Roger Mudd quoted Stephen Ambrose in epilogue, '..This is not an ancient history.'"
5200,767027329,5,"This is an astonishing set of videos.  First there is the jaw-dropping, almost hallucinogenic experiance of seeing WWII events in technicolor.  It reminds one of how much black-and-white film aestheticizes and abstracts events.  Admittedly our eyes don't see in technicolor either, but the color makes you feel far more psychologically ""there"" so to speak.  The second thing is the amazing quality of most of this footage.  It hardly seems to have aged at all in 55-60 years!  When you consider that film from the 1960's sometimes looks atrociously degraded and washed out, the almost pristine look of this footage is remarkable to say the least.  It must have been stored well and never projected.  (Of course, the producers could choose the best-looking bits from what was reputedly hundreds of hours of rediscovered film.)  Watching this film is a tremendously emotional experiance, sometimes frightening, sometimes grueling, sometimes stomach-turning.  The voice-over narration makes heavy use of contemporary letters and diaries of soldiers and civilians, and is often touching.  The cumulative impact of all this----the island fighting, Nazi rallies, shipyard workers, civilians hanged by Nazis, radiation victims, Pearl Harbor wreckage, air war footage, death camps, and on and on----is almost overwhelming.  Like having your nose shoved into the sheer mess and folly of mass war.
Now that I hear that the UK version of this documentary was narrated by the redoubtable John Thaw I'd love to see THAT version, but otherwise I unreservedly recommend this to anyone and everyone.  Too many people think of documentaries as boring but this demonstrates how mesmerizing they can be.  For anyone too young to have first-hand memories of it (which is most of the population now) this makes WWII far more visceral than you ever thought possible."
5201,767027329,5,"This is an excellent DVD with spectacular color footage and excellent commentary about World War II. The historical value of this program is excellent as the facts and historical aspects are presented in a clear and concise manner. This documentary also has the human aspect well covered as most of the footage is accompanied by voiced-over commentary that is taken from actual letters written by soldiers and civilians during the war. The color footage of the home fronts in Great Britain, Russia, Germany and the USA is vivid and superior in quality considering it's 56 - 64 years old. The battle scenes favor the Eastern front and the Pacific with only a few scenes taken from the Western front. There is some footage from the Battle of Normandy but unfortunately no footage from the war in the desert, Operation Market Garden or the Battle of the Bulge. However, there are some incredible scenes taken from occupied Europe/Russia and the liberation of two death camps which are eerie to view in color. This two DVD set is very impressive and well worth it. The bonus footage of Hitler, B-17 bomber crews and the war in the Pacific is absolutely mesmorizing. I would highly recommend this DVD for any WWII historian's collection or for those who want to learn more about the war."
5202,767027329,5,"I expect as you read this, the most two most important questions of your mind (if you're thinking of buying this DVD) is; what is the picture quality like and is it better that the other `WW2 in Color' DVD. The short answer is the picture quality is consistently superb - sharp, saturated and clear. Over three hours of bewildering, sad, horrific and poignant color film. The other DVD is a very good effort, but cannot compete because the new DVD contains footage never before seen anywhere in the last 60 years.  This new DVD has been carefully re-packaged to disguise the fact that it is a British-made Documentary aired last year only in Britain (1999). What distinguishes this from out of the ordinary is not just the picture quality, but what you will see in color. It took three years for the team working on this project to find some of the material. You might think you have seen all possible color footage from WW2, but you will be stunned by some of the 35mm material in this DVD. Much of the new footage comes from two sources; Kodachrome 16mm color film shot by both the Germans (up to 1941), so for example, you will see the movies of an SS General who lead the invasion of France. You will see the pre-war build up in Britain, which starts with the optimism of the 1937 British Coronation (in rare 35mm Dufaycolor) and leads on to extraordinary fiery red images of London being bombed by night. You will see America on the dawn of Pearl Harbour and color film of the actual attack.  Other footage is shot on 16mm German Agfacolor stock and includes the only color film of the Warsaw Ghetto, with the sharp, clear color looking so real that you may think it was only shot recently. Another film is perhaps the most horrifying, footage, which defies detailed description as it shows the day that an SS Troop rounded up the unfortunate Male population of a rural town and executed them by both hanging and rifle. This footage is so shocking that you will never forget how terrifying this war is (you may find this footage distressing, I found it disturbing). The clear color burns the images into your mind.  It is all here; Pearl Harbour/Battle Of The Atlantic/ Stalingrad/Pacific/D-DAY/ Berlin/Buchenwald/Dachau/Hiroshima/ Nagasaki/Paris Liberated/Germany 1938-9/London/The Spanish Civil War. A quiet, respectful commentary by actor John Thaw is augmented by Diary readings from the people who saw the events. This restrained approach is all that is needed as the footage speaks for itself. At the end of the war, we close on footage of Times Square by day as New Yorkers celebrate V.J. day.  You will feel as if the footage is so real as to be a fake, but it isn't and all the more moving because of that.  Here are ordinary people, just like you and I, trapped on color film and shown a half century later.  The images live on. If you want just one DVD about WW2, buy this and never forget what you will experience."
5203,767027329,5,"I like the color film documentaries and this one is very satisfying.  The footage is pretty good and includes many scenes I have never seen before.  If you're a fan of the color film documentaries of WWII, this one should be in your collection."
5204,767027329,5,"I don't know how I missed this one. I have a library of DVDs on WWII but this one really brings it home for me. The photography is fine, but the things
that stay with me are the letters and diaries of the participants. Some of them are nothing short of astonishing. Heartbreaking and shocking. I thought
I couldn't be shocked by WWII material anymore, but I was wrong. It's always been the cost of the war in human lives that I find so unforgettable. To me, the study on Gypsy children by the Nazi working on her doctorate was madness incarnate. I know you have to fight sometimes, but overall this war was insanity in action started by insane men. Who was it who asked, ""Was there ever a good war or a bad peace""? I might add, ""Was there ever a sane war or an insane peace""?"
5205,767027329,5,"This is a very solid video series for WWII.  In three episodes it chronicles the war as a whole.  As a teacher there are many chapters that can be selectively used in the classroom on a variety of WWII topics and themes.  Since it is in color, it is also more appealing to the students.  I recommend it to anyone with an interest in WWII and to history teachers as a classroom resource."
5206,767027329,5,I purchased this for my boyfriend who is a WWII history buff....we thoroughly enjoyed the color footage that was in this DVD....also very touching...everyone that lives in the United States should see this....you won't be disappointed.
5207,767027329,5,"I am adding this set to a DVD collection consisting of: World War II in color ""Thunderbolt""; World War II in color ""The Fighting Lady""; ""World War II in Color""; World War II in HD ""The Air War""; Victory at Sea""; and ""D-Day Remembered"" (a total of eleven discs). I can frankly say that ""The Lost Color Archives set does contain new, never before seen footage and in color.

No new flying sequences or ground fighting film, but seen here is prisoner of war footage and many striking civilian realities. I never knew that when the Russians took Berlin, every Russian soldier was given three days to enter any home or apartment and take what he or she wanted; a grim reminder of hell.

Home movies of Hitler and Eva Brown and others are shown during leisure moments. The walk-through of German citizens ordered by the American authority at the site of a newly liberated concentration camp. Horrific!

Many scenes of English life during and after the bombings and I could go on.

This set is a worthwhile addition to what I have listed above. All are available at amazon.com."
5208,767027329,2,"For the price of these documentaries,,,the color footage is definitely worth 5 stars.(if you pay under 7 dollars).The quality of the color footage is very very good..and not seen in other documentaries I have seen (I have seen most of the ones on Amazon).

HOWEVER....  the History Channel takes the footage and mixes it with its USUAL propaganda and more propaganda stories than talking obectively about WW2. and what happened in the war. so much of the time you will be watching a propaganda story and footage associated with it..and not hearing about the stages of the war.

nice if turn the sound down and just watch what there is interesting only."
5209,767027329,5,"Got this for my dad for Father's Day and he absolutely loved it! It was brand new, completely wrapped up and everything. Great buy."
5210,767027329,5,"This is a great window in time.  The color footage really brings the story home in a closer, more intimate view.  You think you're watching Vietnam footage, untill you see that the uniforms are from 2 decades before. (color was expensive back then, so they didn't do too many).  It talks about the hopes, the fears, and the eventual hopes of the Greatest Generation. (without their sacrifices our world would not be possible).  Let's hope that we learn the lessons, and not deny there was a Holacaust.  Anyone who embraces this view are just as bad as the people who sent 6 million to an untimely demise.  If we don't learn from the past, we are forever doomed to repeat it sadly.  THe best parts are the liberation sequences.  Especially from the GI's point of view of getting such a warm welcome from the Parisians."
5211,767027329,5,A colorful view of WWII. Mostly have only seen black and white WWII - this gives it a new depth.  I would recommend.
5212,767027329,5,"I have yhis,""WW11 IN COLOR'"" and""WW11 THE LOST COLOR ARCHIVES""from
Histoey Chanell. I am very pleased with satisfaction having these
2 DVDs. Each one of DVDs has thiir own characteristics.
From these DVD ,I was supplised with Compact,Comprehensive,Concised
feeling of Dictionary within 1 pack ! It also gave many bonuses including
Time line graphs which made easy tracking of progress of ww11. Good Maps,
Also Actor ,Clark Gable narrated Government filim""Combat America""-
another interesting view of American B-17 stories in England. and
relatively good costs!"
5213,767025512,5,"I enjoyed this athenic(to me anyways) step back in time to Nero Wolf's New York. Thought the characters were pretty close to the mark,especially Inspecter Cramer. Have read all the Nero Wolf books and if you enjoy them you will enjoy this video reproduction. Hope they come out with more."
5214,767025512,4,"I have seen several adaptations of Nero Wolfe novels over the years, including the horrid failed TV series in the late 70s or early 80s.  The movie GOLDEN SPIDERS comes very close to capturing the true nature of both  Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe.  When I started watching the movie, I  thought, here we go again, another failed attempt at putting these guys on  the screen.  Tim Hutton and M. Chaukyn really surpized me.  They really had  the characters down and even though I have read GOLDEN SPIDERS several  times and knew the ending, I could not take my eyes off the screen.  BRAVO.  It is about time somebody did a good job adapting Nero Wolfe to the screen.  Any screen. I especially liked the fact that the movie was set in the time  frame of the original novel (late 50s I think).  Excellent movie.  MAKE  MORE IN THE SERIES PLEASE!"
5215,767027329,3,Good enough for some WWII info and best of all it is closed captioned.  I have many other older WWII documentaries and most are not closed captioned.  Big deal it my world.  This was one of the main reasons I bought this DVD.
5216,767027329,4,"Much of the footage in this 2 DVD set is spectacular. It really makes the events of WW2 seem like they could have happened a couple of years ago. Some of it is so good that it looks as though it might have been faked! Not all of it though. A few clips appear grainy, yellowish, etc. Also, I was truly surprised at how few of these clips I had seen before. Some of them I recognized but the majority were totally new to me (and I have seen a lot of ww2 documentaries). A word of caution: like most war docs, there are some pretty gruesome scenes.
As far as the content, it was pretty good. It was a little like ""The War"" by Ken Burns in that actors would read letters, diary entries, and the like. Indeed,the writings of Quentin Aanenson and Eugene Sledge make their rounds here too (you will know them well from ""The War""). It was kind of funny that the actor would read the letter in English but with an accent from the author's country of origin. I guess it would remind you that the speaker was German, French, Russian, Japanese, or whatever. Kind of goofy but I got used to it. Also, keep in mind that it is only about 3 hrs and they were limited to only showing color footage. Because of this, there is very little detail and some major events are barely mentioned. This is primarily a visual experience. If you're a WW2 buff, you won't learn anything new. Then again, of you're a WW2 buff, I highly recommend this DVD."
5217,767027329,5,"I was amazed when I saw some of this as a child in color at a time when most films were black and white.  I thought that color film wasn't even invented prior to WW II.  Ted Turner can colorize anything these days, even WW I, but this is the real thing and you can tell.  Very nice indeed"
5218,767027329,5,"World War II--The Lost Color Archives gives people a rare opportunity to essentially witness World War II as it actually looked in color. The quality of the color footage varies at times but it certainly gives you the feeling that you were there much more than if you were to watch the same footage shot only in black and white.  The quality of the sound is excellent. Thank goodness for the History Channel from which this program comes!

The first of the two DVDs contains color films of events beginning at about the time of The Spanish Civil War and the coronation of a new King (George) in Great Britain. We witness footage of English statesmen actually visiting amicably with Hitler; Hitler sure had them fooled! There is interesting footage of great historical value concerning the German invasions of countries like Poland and The Soviet Union; and we also see the horrifying color footage of the fires in London during the German bombing of the city.

The first DVD also includes footage of the fight in the Pacific; we see our men fighting to capture islands in the Pacific that could be sued as bases for important military maneuvers including the Enola Gay flight that would drop ""the bomb"" on Japan.

In addition, there is color footage of the brutal Wausau ghetto where Jews were housed like cattle and children were left as orphans on the streets to die. The brutal treatment of the Jews and other Nazi atrocities are made very clear throughout the course of this two DVD set.

The second DVD gives us footage of the last year and one-half of the war. We see D Day, the rescue of France, other countries, and the people in concentration camps from brutal German occupation and the gradual erosion of Hitler's German military machine. The footage continues to show us a great deal of bombing, damage from bombing and carnage. It's truly fascinating to watch World War II in color.

The DVDs have some extras on the second of the two DVDs. What we get is mostly more color footage that was not used for the actual program of World War II in color. There is footage of Hitler and the elite guards at his country estate and we get great footage of Americans fighting their best. We see more footage of fires raging through destroyed cities--and more. This is excellent bonus footage and it lasts about twenty minutes.

Overall, I highly recommend this two DVD package for history buffs, military buffs and veterans of World War II. This color footage is actually quite rare and I believe that it has great historical significance."
5219,767027329,5,"History and war buffs, rejoice. Just when you thought you'd seen every World War II documentary, from ""The World At War"" to ""Victory At Sea"", this set appears. While you may not glean a wealth of new information or insight into the period, the color films imbue the war with an immediacy you've never experienced before- unless of course, you were there. This alone makes the DVD a worthwhile investment of time and money. Bear in mind this is all bona-fide color footage-nothing has been colorized. The effect is spellbinding, almost miraculous- as when Judy Garland as Dorothy first lands in Oz."
5220,767027329,4,"Based on reviews I'd read beforehand, I expected something big with this 2-disc set.  To its credit, it runs 2 hours and 51 minutes.  But it's on the pricey side and a lot of what's shown here has been on other more recent (and less expensive) DVD's, like ""Hitler, in Color,"" which is really outstanding.  I also expected this DVD set to be better than ""World War II in Color, the British Story.""  On the contrary, the latter costs less than half of this one, ran over an hour longer and had more unique footage and commentary.  The ""British Story"" is all on a single, collector's edition, digital disc.

For those building a DVD library on World War II, especially color features, this 2-volume set belongs in your collection.  For those operating on a budget, choose the two DVD's noted above, first.  Then, consider ""Visions of War, Vol. 2--Hitler, in His Own Words,"" and various pieces on Winston Churchill, for greater value."
5221,767027329,5,"Apart from the obvious important issue of color, ""Lost Color Archives"" is different from many other documentaries dealing with World War II.  The emphasis is much less on causes and facts than it is on the impact of the war on society and individuals.  Its use of personal observances is remeniscent of the way Ken Burns used eye witness accounts in ""The Civil War"" to make more of an impact on the viewer.
Evenso, from a historical perspective, ""Lost Color Archives"" does deserve high praise as a solid explanation of the war as a whole.  Because it is told largely from the eye witness point of view, the viewer has a sense of the impending conflict, then the endurance through the war, and finally, the exhausted conclusion.  Emphasis is placed on the fact that the war was over, but that much of the world had been destroyed and that the effects and rememberance of the war would linger on.
Add color to all this and the documentary clearly stands above anything else I've ever seen about the war.  Some of the images are average, some are stunning, some are beautiful, some are horrifying, but all are in color.
The combination of the color video and the first person narratives often sent chills down my spine."
5222,767027329,3,"A good overall look at the available color footage during the war. The commentary is quite good as well. Unfortunately, much of the footage is not as good as it could be. The first program on the first disc has a disappointing black level, and as a result, much of the footage looks too bright and washed out. While the next two programs improve on this, other DVDs such as ""The Third Reich in Color"" have presented color European theatre and Third Reich footage more carefully. However, none can compete all at once with this two disc set.
The color footage shot during actual battles and preperation for D-Day are high points, as well as the seven minutes or so of Eva Braun home movies on the end of the disc. Pacific theatre buffs will feel shortchanged; I'd say 80 to 85% of the material concerns Europe. This DVD set is certainly worthwhile if you wish to see a large quantity of period color footage with informative commentary. It succeeds in bringing the war and the period to life."
5223,767027329,5,My husband loves these DVDs.  He can't stop talking about them.  I guess I need to watch them too.
5224,767000021,4,"He was a Savior who died for our sake, but he didn't walk on water, alright?"
5225,767000021,5,"I really appreciate this video and I highly recommend it. As usual, A&E did an excellent job. I first saw it with a group of young people, ages between 13 and 15. After watching it we went through a little  discussion where everyone expressed their own opinion. There were a lot of  questions and we had a very exciting meeting, where everyone was trying to  clear up some conceits about this great figure of mankind's History.
  Everyone should be interested in learning more about the life of this  extraordinary man whose teachings have influenced humanity for more than  two thousand years. For many centuries his life and teachings was framed by  the biggest riligious groups, specially the Roman Church. Thus, whatever  they used to say about him, this was what one could be able to learn,  whether it was right or wrong. For long time his life and teachings was  subject to a big monopoly carried out by those who thought they could own  the truth. Im 1863 the renowned rationalist and scholar of religion Ernest  Renan in his classic biography of Jesus ""THE LIFE OF JESUS"", the  first one to be written, warned us:
  ""Constantine made of the most  free and spontaneous religious movement an official worship, subject to the  State, and persecutor in its turn.""
  Fortunately, this reality  started changing in the middle of the eighteen century. Since then a lot of  writings and researches have been undertaken in order to bring more light  over this great personage of the History and the influences caused on  humanity by his moral teachings. Thanks to these scholarly and scientific  investigation we have today a much more accurate knowledge on Jesus' life  and teachings. Everyone knows by now that even the Gospels, which are yet  considered the most reliable source on the matter, suffered adultaration in  order to fit the interests of the religious group in charge to  proselytize.
  Besides all the sources available today on the subject,  one must take in account the apocripha Gospels, specially St. Thomas  Gospel. It does not matter if the Roman Church considers it as a reliable  source or not, because only God knows the reason why they keep insisting in  this position.
  Among the arguments stretched out by the 11 scholars  who took part in this video recording, one particularly touched me. I am  talking about John Dominic Crossan and his statements:
  ""The  vision of God which Jesus has is one of what can be best described of  radically egalitarianism - a refusal to draw discriminations and hierachies  and lines of demarcation - separating this from that one, lower from  higher, pure from impure, male from female, slave from free, pagan from  jews. It's a refusal to accept the basic distinctions which most people in  his society accepted.""
  ""Jesus incarnates a dream, a profound  and ancient dream, deeply embedded in human spirit for a world of radical  justice, radical equality, for a world not of a domination, but  empowerment. And above all, for the announcement that that it is what God,  that is what the holly and the sacred is concerned about, not about  domination but empowerment, about a world of justice. That is the permanent  abiding legacy of Jesus and as long as that dream is alive, Jesus is  alive.""
  Another point of the video that also called my attention  was the narrator's (Jack Perkings), who also did a wonderful job, closing  words:
  ""It is one of History's greatest ironies. The mighty Roman  Empire which crucified Him, would one day come to worship the young stone  cutter of the Galilee. Certainly on that day, long ago when Jesus died, no  one could've foreseen that. As the centuries passed millions of people  around the world would come to emprace his spiritual vision.""
  This is a very good source of information on Jesus' life. It is definitely  worth buying."
5226,767000021,5,HE has given me a new everlasting life with HIM.. I love HIM very..very..much Thank you Lord for giving me a new life and thank you for give me a special person in your life.. AMEN !
5227,767023765,5,This movie is the best movie I've seen when Washinton crosses the delaware to battle the Heshens is the best part
5228,767023765,5,"this was a great movie that really helps you see into the heart and mind of General George Washington, His Generals, and his soilders. Even if your just looking for a good action-drama, this is great. Jeff Daniels is  magnificent and so is the senery, battles, camera work, etc. An enticing  film about the troubles of crossing the river keeping them from trenton...  a must see."
5229,767023765,5,"Superb movie, excellent casting ! Just as in Gettysburg, Jeff Daniels gives a magnificent performance. What impressed me the most however, was the realistic portrayal of just how close we came to never achieving  independence ! A must see for all those interested in the American  Revolution."
5230,767023765,4,"I loved the true story of courage.  I objected to the cursing, because the reading I have done about Washington describes him as an introvert, and a God fearing man who constantly encouraged his men to pray, repent, fast and seek divine guidance for the cause of the revolution.  I think the frequent cursing was added to the story by script writers who thought the language would add drama to the situation, which it did not!"
5231,767023765,5,"If you like history , this is a fime for you !"
5232,767023765,4,"With his Continental Army shrinking around him George Washington has someone 'requisition' some ships to get his men across the river so they will not be as easily accessible to being demolished. He gathers with advisors and is ridiculed for his lack of leadership and the fact that he ahs not won a battle.

For his last act he decides to attack Trenton, New Jersey where Soldiers of Fortune are stationed, to accomplish that they will have to get a thousand men across the river, at night in the cold for Christmas! They arrive at dawn and attack. Interesting and insightful. War violence, swearing.

In Extras is a making of feature in which Jeff Daniels talks."
5233,767023765,5,Great movie.
5234,767023765,5,"Jeff Daniels is one of my favorite actors. In this film he plays the part of Gen. Washington who leads his forces across the Delaware river to attack Trenton. Mr. Daniels plays the part of Washington with great humor, which of course in real life Washington never had. But Jeff Daniels makes Washington seem like a man you would follow, because he could lead."
5235,767023765,5,This is a great movie about Washington's role in the Revolutionary war and caused me to reflect on the lives of my ancestors who fought in it and what they had to endure. Amazing how much Jeff Daniels resembles President Washington!
5236,767023765,4,good
5237,767023765,4,good
5238,767023765,5,"Finally, a true telling of the story. The facts are even better than the myths that grew up over time."
5239,767023765,4,My husband really likes special movies to fit the holiday. He really enjoyed the further truths and knowledge he gained from this movie.
5240,767023765,5,great!!!
5241,767023765,5,"A true hero's story! Acted with great craft, and true realism."
5242,767023765,5,Excellent!
5243,767023765,1,Excellent
5244,767023765,5,If you like history you will love this movie....
5245,767023765,5,Not actually a review as a request. Amazon needs to make this movie available in digital format on Amazon Video. This is a great movie!
5246,767023765,5,shows why the capital city is named for him
5247,767023765,5,"We loved this version of Washingtons life. Nicely done and not too terribly altered to fit pop culture standards. Great for homeschool history. My 8 year old son was riveted, till near the end when there were no more battles."
5248,767023765,4,"Good story, well done."
5249,767023765,1,Bad
5250,767023765,1,NOT CLOSED CAPTIONED.  Not subtitled.  It is a great story if you have normal hearing but if you need closed captioning or subtitles you are out of luck.
5251,767023765,5,Another great history lesson come alive ... worth the investment ...
5252,767023765,5,Jeff Daniels does a fine Washington portrayal.
5253,767023765,5,excellent !
5254,767023765,5,"Very, very good!"
5255,767023765,5,"Inspiring, shows how God was there to answer their prayers."
5256,767023765,5,A must see for the whole family!
5257,767023765,5,An interesting portrayal of a time when the American Revolution almost failed.  I like Jeff Daniels in this.
5258,767023765,5,Fast! Excellent flick
5259,767023765,5,EXCELLENT!  BRAVO!
5260,767023765,5,"No trees or yuletide spirit here but a Christmas movie of a different flavor, if you like that sort of thing."
5261,767023765,5,This is one of my favorite movies that I can haul out and watch over and over especially at Christmas time. It sticks pretty closely to the historical event and has some humor as well. Jeff Daniels always looks just like whomever he is depicting. It's quite uncanny.
5262,767023765,4,Great movie.  Jeff Daniels portrays General Washington well !
5263,767023765,5,"Great!  My son is a history buff, and said the accuracy of the weapons and uniforms was right on."
5264,767023765,5,Good depiction of the problems faced by George Washington when chased by the British after the New York defeat and when crossing the Delaware Rivet to attack Trenton.
5265,767023765,5,Great movie as it tells the story of the crossing of the Delaware river very well.  It really shows what the American must have suffered during that winter.
5266,767023765,5,"a very authentic historical depiction, and my 2 grandsons, 12 and 13, loved it, and have already watched it again"
5267,767023765,5,In insightful take on of the most important but nearly forgotten battles of the Ameican Revolution which had the longest odds and gambled the survival of independence in the most uncertain weeks of the war. Washington's crossing of the Delaware to attack Trenton is known more for a painting it inspired but  the film goes deeper into the battle that kept the cause alive and an army intact when defeat seemed inevitable.
5268,767023765,5,Jeff Daniels plays a convincing role as the desperate George Washington in December 1776.  The movie does a good job of evoking the chaos and challenge of those weeks just before the first Christmas of independence.
5269,767023765,5,"Had this on tape, now I have it on DVD.  Love this story and will always think of Jeff Daniels as George Washington.  Very well done!"
5270,767023765,5,This video fully met my expectations.  Great acting and truthful portrayal of the historical events related to and surrounding Washington's crossing of the Delaware.  Thank you.
5271,767023765,5,Good movie.  Would recommend.
5272,767023765,5,"We saw this movie ages ago on cable, but it doesn't seem to air anymore. The acting is fantastic, and the movie dramatically tells the story of a turning point in the Revolutionary War. We watched it with our son, and he really liked it."
5273,767023765,5,"THIS ONE IS ONE THAT I PURCHASED FROM AMAZON.  HAVING BEEN BORN AND LIVED IN NORTH NEW JERSEY, AND AS LITTLE CHILDREN WE OFTEN TALKED ABOUT THE PICTURE OF GEORGE WASHINGTON CROSSING A FROZEN RIVER AND TRYING TO MAKE IT TO GET HIS ARMY ACROSS THAT RIVER. THE IMAGE OF G. WASHINGTON WAS.  FOR ME, THE PART THAT IMPRESSES ME THE MOST IS THE ""SURPRISE"" ABOUT SOME THINGS HE DID - AND HOW THEY DID THEM.  (NOTE: I WILL BUY ANOTHER COPY OF THIS MOVIE, BECAUSE I SURE DON'T WANT TO LOOSE THIS ONE. IF YOU GET ONE, AND IF IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING IS GRAY IN APPEARANCE, THAT WAS DONE ON PURPOSE. AFTER THE MOVIE FINISHES, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO KNOW WHY.  JUST WAIT FOR THE VARIOUS ""INVITATIONS"" AND IF YOU READ THEM, EACH ONE WILL ADD QUITE A BIT REGARDING THIS HAZY WEATHER.  I SAY THIS ALSO BECAUSE I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN NEW JERSEY. IF THEY HAD USED BRIGHT SUNLIGHT, IT WOULD NOT BE AUTHENTIC.  AND, IT'S NOT VERY EXPENSIVE AND VERY EDUCATIONAL."
5274,767023765,5,5stars
5275,767023765,5,definitely buy fro you guys again!  very PLEASED!
5276,767023765,5,This is a most remarkable movie of a key episode of the Revolutionary War.  The characters are ALL wonderful and each memorable.  Daniels makes a most impressive Washington but all the actors are strong.  Have already watched it twice and will certainly watch it more.  Many thanks for the very quick service.
5277,767023765,5,good historical take on history
5278,767023765,5,Jeff Daniels is brilliant in bringing George Washington to life.  Every American needs to see this movie about the very pinnacle of American liberation.
5279,767023765,5,Excellent support video
5280,767019245,5,"For persons who are interested in looking into the ways in which ancient Rome went to war, this is a must-buy video.  It is one of the more well-done documentaries that I have seen and does an excellent job of laying out the battle tactics, territory, major personages and instruments of Roman warfare up until about the time of the Antonine rulers.
What makes this documentary particularly special is its usage of authentic and re-created signs of Roman hegemony.  For example, we have the opportunity to view a  nearly full-scale mock up of a Roman fort in a forest located in Germany.  We also see the palisades where Vercingetorix made his last stand in what is modern day France.
On top of this, we are invited to archeological excavations in & around Hadrian's Wall which was built to demark the line between Great Britain and Scotland (Caledonia).  The scholars there disinter the coinage of Rome thru the ages, as well as ancient letters of soldiers, medical instruments and much more.  Fascinating stuff!
For a grand overview of the expanse of the Roman empire, this would be a terrific video-set to buy.  However, precious little is shown or alluded to Rome itself.  For those who are only interested in the history & politics inside Rome, other documentaries would be much more appropriate.  If, on the other hand, you want to know more about the Legions on the frontiers of Roman territories, the present videos would be a superb choice."
5281,767023765,5,Absolutely perfect! Authentic costuming is great for reenactors.
5282,767023765,5,"I've always loved this movie. Definitely won to have in the collection. I will say, it needs remastered....  The picture is a bit dark and washed out. Definitely not made in HD."
5283,767023765,5,great
5284,767023765,3,Bit boring
5285,767023765,5,"An example of Jeff Daniels leadership, tough and risky."
5286,767023765,5,Excellent quality
5287,767023765,5,The dvd was in great condition and the movie was amazing!!
5288,767023765,5,Great video
5289,767023765,5,beautiful story
5290,767023765,5,"Very imaginative fictional portrayal, closely paralleling actual events and personages; a great read."
5291,767023765,5,"The Crossing covers a small but crucial part of the American Revolution. Based largely on Washington's personal correspondence, it is probably fairly accurate, but without embedded journalists, who knows for sure.  Daniels plays Washington with dignity, and passion.  The supporting cast of little known actors do quite well also.  The battle is well staged despite Hollywood's abhorrence of muzzle loading muskets and their capability of fully automatic fire.  This film can stand with Gettysburg as the best look at part of one  of America's wars."
5292,767023765,3,ok
5293,767023765,5,Enjoyed this movie much more than I expected!
5294,767023765,5,One of my all-time favorite films.
5295,767023765,5,Very good movie
5296,767023765,5,This film is spellbinding. Jeff Daniels shows the human side of General Washington & gives a praiseworthy performance. I watch this DVD every several months & never grow weary.
5297,767023765,5,A movie EVERYONE SHOULD watch.
5298,767023765,5,"I watched ""The Crossing"" a few years ago and probably watched it more than a dozen times. I fell more deeply in love with America my Country each time I saw it. My husband watched it more than I did. We needed a new copy of the movie. We just love the way Jeff Daniels portrayed GEORGE Washington, The Father of our country.  Mrs. Nancy L.Horning"
5299,767023765,5,"You need not be a history buff to enjoy this historical movie.  It is a largly accurate telling of George Washington and the Continental Army snatching victory from the jaws of defeat during the early months of the Revolutionary War.  Plentiful action, excellent dialogue and a wonderful performance by Jeff Daniels will make you feel like you are standing by Washington's side as he leads his nearly decimated Army on a daring campaign in the dead of winter."
5300,767023765,5,As described  - Great bit of history - currently no issues
5301,767023765,4,ok
5302,767023765,5,"A&E does a masterful job of putting together a top-notch cast with an event of great importance to the future of the foundling United States of America.
The acting, portrayal of conditions and general lack of support and material for prosecuting a war against Great Britain was well done. The moral of the Continental Army under Washington was at an all-time low prior to the crossing. Indeed they had known little but defeat until that time. Washington even had his doubts about whether some of his chief commanders would even follow orders.
The story of the crossing, the hanging in the balance of the war with Great Britain, and the attack on Trenton are all masterfully done. Kudoes to A&E. May they continue to produce more historically based efforts of this quality in the future.
5 stars...don't miss it."
5303,767023765,5,Great historical film and love Jeff Daniels as George Washington.  Great way to learn about events in history.
5304,767023765,4,"This was shared with middle school students; everyone learned about the historical time and the people. An example of American grit and heroes who did not give up. These were not perfect people, but united young men compelled to save America from the Brits. No whining here."
5305,767023765,4,"Adequate, only because this is the only film I've seen about an important piece of American history."
5306,767023765,5,wished Monroe had had a bigger part.
5307,767023765,5,Excellent.
5308,767023765,5,The best Jeff Daniels movie IMHO.  It really makes one think how close we came to giving up except for General Washington.
5309,767023765,5,Very well done
5310,767023765,5,great
5311,767023765,5,"Very good movie,I recommend it too any one interested in George Washington."
5312,767023765,5,Every student of US History should watch this!!!
5313,767023765,4,"Good, but some inaccuracies."
5314,767023765,5,"Well acted and more historically accurate than most. (Except that part where the men start singing in the dead of night as they row through the ice to surprise the enemy). It's a great story, well scripted and directed,  with lots of action. Worth watching and worth keeping in your library."
5315,767023765,3,"I like the story, but it was not as exciting, considering what it was about, as I expected."
5316,767023765,5,"Excellent portrayals and great continuity throughout the film. The music was very good as was the attention to detail. I recommend this
film to everyone who enjoys seeing a fine re-enactment of one of the greatest achievements in the Revolutionary War, led by George
Washington, the most singular military leader and hero of the war."
5317,767023765,5,I enjoyed this very much!!
5318,767023765,5,Very pleased.
5319,767023765,4,Better than any fiction on TV.  A good review of one of the more important events influencing the direction of our war for independence.
5320,767023765,5,We've had our own homemade tape of this for years. So glad to have this. Our whole family loves it.
5321,767023765,5,Great price. Arrived quickly.
5322,767023765,5,I love books about that era. The brave men and women who fought for our freedoms
5323,767023765,4,interesting take on the crossing all thought conversation obviously imagined
5324,767023765,4,"I liked it primarily because it's a historical war movie. Not the greatest production, but when you consider how many movies we have from this period in our history, you won't get much better.

I think Jeff Daniels did a fine job as Washington, though I DID like him better as Joshua Chamberlain."
5325,767023765,5,This is our annual Christmas Eve movie.  Great movie!
5326,767023765,5,I thought that it was great
5327,767023765,4,well done!
5328,767023765,5,Wonderful movie!  Great history and information about Washington and his army crossing the Delaware River during the American Revolution.  Really enjoyed this movie.  It really makes you appreciate the hardships and dedication of George Washington and his troops.
5329,767023765,4,Good.
5330,767023765,5,Superb!
5331,767023765,4,"Not a bad movie at all, but lacks a bit of historical accuracy."
5332,767023765,5,Wonderful movie and a lot of highlights that are very interesting.  Jeff Daniels does a fine job.
5333,767023765,5,"As a history buff, I really enjoy the Revolutionary war period pieces and the Civil War. Jeff Daniels  portrays people from both wars with style and excellent acting."
5334,767023765,5,Great movie depicting Washington's Crossing of the Delaware. Jeff Daniels is wonderful as George Washington.
5335,767023765,5,"Excellent insight as to the struggles, determination, patriotism, & courage of the Father of our Country & his army."
5336,767023765,5,Very good movie...Jeff Daniels portrayed him well.
5337,767023765,5,Great movie I do enjoy my History stories lol
5338,767023765,5,"I really enjoyed this movie
 I wish more people would have their kids watch some of these movies. Very educational. I learned a lot about the start of our country. Recommend highly"
5339,767023765,5,great
5340,767023765,5,Cancel
5341,767023765,5,Used to teaching 8th grade Social Studies.  Very good and the students liked it
5342,767023765,4,Well directed movie
5343,767023765,5,Awesome show of the battle of Trenton.
5344,767023765,5,"I teach U.S. History to middle school through freshman. I found the Crossing to be an excellent movie for explaining conflicts between Washington, Congress, officers especially Gates. The movie captures the desperation that the militia was facing in the battle of Trenton.
I also enjoyed the gentleman mentality of the Hessian colonel and Washington's reply (the way the Hessian's butchered the colonials at Brooklyn). Lastly, the crossing depicts the diversity of the colonial troops."
5345,767023765,4,good movie
5346,767023765,4,"Overall I liked this movie.  I have read some of the other reviews and in some instances found them over critical.  Was there too much swearing?  Yeah, it was a little too much in light of GW very rarely using foul language.  Is it 100% accurate?  No it is not as pointed out by other reviewers.  Does it have the production values of ""John Addams"" or ""Band of Brothers""?  No but I doubt ""The Crossing"" had the same budget.  But it is the only movie I am aware of that is about the battle of Trenton and why it was so pivotal. Many people, whose only knowledge of the Washington Crossing the Delaware is Leutze's painting, may be drawn in to learning more about this most interesting period of time in American history."
5347,767023765,5,"You won't believe this is the star of ""Dumb and Dumber."" This is a remarkably well done study of one of the most amazing episodes in the history of American warfare."
5348,767023765,5,"I saw this movie years ago and recorded it off TV.  After many years and a format transfer, my copy was in pretty poor shape.  Happy to have a DVD copy to enjoy (as I did last night).

""The Crossing"" tells the story of General George Washington's preparations to attack the Hessian soldiers (in service to Britain) at Trenton on Christmas 1776.  The movie highlights the disagreements and personality conflicts between Washington and some of his key commanders, and the challenges of pulling off such a revolutionary attack.

The movie benefits from many quality actors and from its tight focus on the build-up to the crossing, the crossing, fight, and immediate aftermath.  I don't think I'd known until watching this that Washington's men retreated back across the river after the attack.

My only real quibble with the video quality is that you can tell where the commercial breaks were from the original TV production airing.  I would think that they could have edited the video together a little bit better so that those weren't as noticeable or else didn't exist at all on the DVD.  It wasn't so bad that I couldn't enjoy the movie, but it was noticeable at least a few times.

I liked Jeff Daniels from his work in Ted Turner's Gettysburg/Gods and Generals and like him here as well.  As with the two movies I've just mentioned, this one gives little bits of info on what happened to some of these historical figures after this battle."
5349,767023765,2,"The acting was really great.  It was quite enjoyable but seemed to differ on the character of George Washington.  He was known for not allowing cursing, for reading his Bible several times a day and praying.  I did not see any of these qualities displayed."
5350,767023765,5,"Great movie, my husband just loves it!"
5351,767023765,4,Good account of history and acting Jeff Daniels
5352,767023765,5,excellent !
5353,767023765,5,One of my favorite Christmas movies!
5354,767023765,4,"Excellent movie, originally a TV miniseries.  Maybe some minor historical errors, but overall a great treatment, and inspires new respect for General Washington and those that fought with him."
5355,767023765,1,"Just what we need: a screenplay by Marxist author Howard Fast on Washington's attack on Trenton.  A waste of the considerable talent of Jeff Daniels. Washington simply did not reason the way he is portrayed by Fast. This is what might have happened had Howard Fast been leading
the Revolution."
5356,767023765,5,This is a powerful presentation depicting the courage & bravery of those who founded this great country.  Jeff Daniels is a fine George Washington.
5357,767023765,5,"This is a superb docudrama. By limiting it to a brief event it conveys a great deal about the whole war, doesn't drag at all. I so wish someone would take this as a model for more docudramas."
5358,767023765,5,"Great DVD, Fast Service, Thanks."
5359,767023765,5,"Great movie, especially if you love American history.  Professional and very well done."
5360,767023765,5,Good movie
5361,767023765,5,Very well done if a bit hammy in parts but a fun watch.
5362,767023765,5,Well done but not overblown like many hollywood movies are!! Great acting.
5363,767023765,5,Well done profile of GW at the crossroads of the Revolution .  How did we ever win?
5364,767023765,5,Very enjoyable.
5365,767023765,5,One of the best American Revolution DVD's. Jeff Daniels shows Washington as resolute and a great tactician.
5366,767023765,5,wonderful historical correct movie
5367,767023765,5,"""The Crossing"" is a surprisingly well-done TV historical drama based on General George Washington's iconic crossing of the Delaware River on Christmas night, 1776.  The moment, and the movie, focus on a low point in American fortunes during the Revolutionary War.  Washington's Continental Army had been driven in defeat from New Jersey by the British Army, and faced dissolving altogether as enlistments expired at the end of the year.  Washington daringly staked everything on a surprise counter-attack that caught the enemy sleeping off the holiday in Trenton in the early hours of 26 December.  Washington's high stakes gamble saved the Continental Army, and perhaps the young United States, from extinction.

Jeff Daniels is very credible as the stern and determined Washington.  The supporting cast is also quite good, especially Sebastian Roche as the tough-minded General John Glover from Massachusetts, now unfortunately largely forgotten in history, whose Marblehead fishermen rowed the Army across an ice-choked river.  The production values and the attention to detail should easily satisfy most viewers.  It would be hard not to be caught up in the drama of the situation.  Recommended."
5368,767023765,5,Need more like this.
5369,767023765,1,George Washington was VERY opposed to swearing.  He was known to punish his men if they swore.  SO WHY does Jeff Daniels swear like a sailor in this film.  It might have been good if the writers had not used such foul language.  George Washington would have been appalled to view this! BAD FORM A&E.  You could have done so much better!
5370,767023765,5,"One of my favorite historical films; it really brings you back in time to the Battle of Trenton, and has you respect those brave soldiers and their commanders, including very much George Washington."
5371,767023765,5,Wonderful movie.
5372,767023765,5,Great movie.
5373,767023765,5,"Fear of my VHS going out I knew I had to get this DVD
.  One of my favorite movies"
5374,767023765,5,a good rendition of the events in history
5375,767023765,5,"I saw this movie many years ago but thoroughly enjoyed purchasing it and watching it again.  This video is difficult to find now, it can't be rented and it's not on pay-per-view.  Thank you."
5376,767023765,5,"This is a very well-scripted and well-acted portrayal of this critical event in American History.  Washington's, faith, strength and courage come across well.  It made me appreciate how tentative the Revolution was, and how close we came to being subjects of the British Crown.  Very inspiring!"
5377,767023765,2,"I wish I could give this movie a better review. Amazon did NOT warn customers that this movie was not subtitled or closed-captioned for the hearing-impaired/Deaf. In my family, we need all our DVDs to have subtitles or close-captioning capabilities. Don't get this movie if you rely on subtitles.

I cannot judge this movie on its historical content since I was unable to understand what was being said. But having read other people's reviews, it sounds like a movie worth watching. I only wish that A&E had released it with subtitles so everyone would have the opportunity to enjoy Jeff Daniels as George Washington."
5378,767023765,4,I want to share this with our grandchildren because of the American Heritage in our family.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
5379,767023765,5,Jeff Daniels was a good choice to play George Washington in this historical drama recording Washington's famous crossing of the Delaware River and the raid on the Hession barracks at Trenton that ended in a rout victory for the Colonists. Well done.
5380,767023765,5,"I saw this made-for-cable movie back when it premiered, and it's still a masterpiece. I let 2 friends borrow it so far and they both say it's one of the best movies ever. Jeff Daniels is perfect as General Washington. Great acting, wardrobe, authentic-looking sets. Amazing. You'll never forget this legend as the turning point in our great nation's history."
5381,767023765,5,This movie is one of the best on General Washington and the crossing of the Potomac!! A must for the history lover!
5382,767023765,5,Great
5383,767023765,5,The actors make the Revolutionary War come alive again. Henry Knox and George Washington are well played. Revolutionary War buffs will enjoy this movie. Make a trek up the Knox Trail to really bring this movie to life for you. Henry Knox Rox.
5384,767023765,5,"I had an old copy of"" The Crossing"" and had stopped showing it in my seventh grade classroom, but I decided to order the new copy and begin showing it again.  My students loved it, and so did I.  It was so much better than the older copy.  The students were much better able to understand the war, the character of George Washington. the crossing of the Delaware, and its importance in the
Revolutionary War."
5385,767023765,1,"The portrayal of Washington was so contrary to what we can know of the real man from his own personal writings and from that which was written of him by his contemporaries that watching it aroused in me anger and sadness.  I originally bought this movie in order to select a 30 minute clip of this relevant Christmastime topic to show to my chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.

The foul language made it undesirable from the beginning. But worse, was that the writer, director or actor must not have bothered researching the person of George Washington. He would not have taken the name of the Lord in vain and did not even allow his men to swear. He was known to have impeccable manners, yet this movie has him loudly belittling General Henry Knox, in front the troops, for being overweight! This was supposed to be the funny part of the movie, I suppose; making fun of a great American hero who, one year earlier, was responsible for the British evacuation of Boston after having captured 59 canon and mortars from Fort Ticonderoga and bringing them 300 miles in the worst of weather to General Washington.

Jeff Daniels played Washington with no personality whatsoever. He was expressionless throughout the movie! Impatient, rude, snide - yes. But void of positive character traits. Washington was made to look like an imbalanced, foolish man. In real life, no one would have put such a person in a position of  leadership or would have followed him. There was NOTHING admirable or endearing about Daniels' portrayal of this revered American founder.

The saddest part of all of this is that the Amazon star rating here shows that most Americans have not studied history enough to realize what was so grossly wrong with this movie"
5386,767023765,5,it was a very good movie. i usally watch civil war movie cause im a civil war reeanctor here in vermont.i give this 5 stars. for those who are civil war buffs there are many  videos that really are very detail to some battles . my advise is to get ken burns civil war . this is the only one that tells the history of our country. from 1861 to 1865 and up to  the assaonation of abe lincoln this is an out standing video. amazon may have this on
5387,767023765,4,"I loved this movie, but I would recommend only showing parts of it to children.  Overall this is a well-done movie that is interesting and did keep the attention of my American history students.  It does a wonderful job of portraying what really took place during the crossing of the Delaware and the Battle of Trenton.  The movie is more of a Hollywood action/drama style movie than a ""boring"" biography/non-fiction history movie. However, it does contain quite a bit of crude language, gratuitous violence (when they surprise the Hessians), and adult scenes.  If you are a teacher or parent and plan to show this to your children, you'll definitely need to watch it ahead of time and fast forward through a few of the scenes."
5388,767023765,5,Very prompt!  Got it just before I needed it.  I teach American History in Junior High and the action was great to hold their attention while they learned history!
5389,767023765,5,Again Thank you for all.  I will certainly go to Amazon for any future DVDs and the price was excellent.
5390,767023765,5,Jeff daniels did a superb job as he always does. I'm intrigued by what our forefathers fought through for us to gain the freedoms we now own.
5391,767023765,5,"I am sure there is a bunch of Hollywood in this, but if you think about conditions and all, it is a great movie and story, that all should see and understand."
5392,767023765,5,This is a great video to use as a teaching aid for homeschoolers to augment their other American history study lessons.
5393,767023765,4,"The only thing keeping me from giving this movie a 5 star rating is that the production was obviously on a limited budget. But true stories are the best stories, and the story of how dangerously close this nation came to losing the War for Independence is one that bears repeating. Our victory against the British was surely the result of Divine Intervention. There is a lot of great acting in this movie."
5394,767023765,4,Daniels does an remarkable job as Washington and the story is itself fascinating. But having read historical accounts of the crossing of the Delaware I confess there are simplifications. But that's American story-telling: history be damned.
5395,767023765,5,I saw this on TV and decided to get it to show the family every Thanksgiving.  It has great acting and it is very realistic in it's approach to the journey to America.  I will show it at school as well.
5396,767023765,5,"Unmistakably, one of General Washington's finest moments, this story is portrayed extremely well by Jeff Daniels and the rest of the cast. Well done!"
5397,767023765,5,"The historical story, and the  lead actor, I was not disappointed, it was wonderful. A&E did a fine job. We were once a nation to be
proud of."
5398,767023765,5,"Truly excellent films on the Revolutionary War are rare indeed, and this is absolutely one of the very best.  While it is a serious, well-filmed story on General Washington's most challenging times during the war, with plenty of drama built into it, it is very much a factual masterpiece, more than adequately supported at the conclusion by a summary of the lives of the individuals who were most prominently featured in the story.  The film carefully built up enduring the dire situation at Valley Forge into culminating with Washington's famed ""Crossing of the Delaware,"" no mean logistics feat at the time, and the surprise taking of the British forces at Trenton

Perhaps the most powerful aspect of the film is Jeff Daniels' portrayal of George Washington, during which he once again showed his versatile thespian abilities.  I cannot think of another contemporary actor who could have played the part more believably.  Be assured, the casting organization that selected the rest of the actors did a wonderful job.  While some of these are not prominent actors, their selections to those parts, and their deliveries of same were superior."
5399,767023765,5,Great historical movie. Jeff Daniels assumes the character of George Washington excellently. No foul language but is a bit gory.
5400,767023765,5,"Every has visons of Christmas morning - waking up, opening presents, But in 1776 Washington and te Continental Army crossed a nearly frozen Delaware River. This is that story. But this story goes into some personality traits and some of his men.  Highly recommended at a time when it has become chick to belittle our foundng father."
5401,767023765,5,You might learn a little history about the American Revolution that was not taught in public school... I reccommend it for everyone.
5402,767023765,5,I won't repeat the superlatives. I't one of my favorite historical movies.  But I was disappointed there was no captioning available.
5403,767023765,5,A beautifully produced film on the events and circumstances of George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River and the Battle of Trenton.  I wanted it so I might see how it was for Washington and our troops.  It's excellent.  I would recommend it to everyone studying the American War of Independence or citizen interested in the history of our country.
5404,767023765,5,"Movie was made for TV, but doesn't suffer for it.  Very accurate, well-made portrayal, I watch it every year around Christmas (when the historical event occurred.)  Well worth the money."
5405,767023765,5,"December 1776: The Revolution thus far, was a disaster.

For twelve months the first American patriots had endured very little success against the British, being out-classed and routed from the battlefield in almost every engagement. Desertion was rampant. Arms, ammunition, and rations were scarce. Only a small number of the Revolutionaries had any military experience.

Even worse, as was usual in warfare until the 20th century, epidemic diseases were the major cause of casualties, with so many men living together in the open under unsanitary conditions. As if this wasn't bad enough, it was winter, and most of Washington's demoralized troops had only days left to their enlistment contracts.

With the Revolution on the verge of collapse, General Washington needed a victory, ...immediately.

At this point in American History, ...America, OUR nation, was dangerously close to never HAVING a history. This was, quite possibly, the most critical moment in the story of America. The man who signifigantly changed our national destiny at this moment in time, was George Washington.

So how did General Washington save the Revolution from collapse? The story is portrayed most excellently in this movie!

General Washington received intelligence that a regiment of German Hessian mercenaries had made winter-quarters in Trenton, New Jersey. The troops from Hess were considered amongst the very best of professional soldiers in Europe. They had already inflicted severe defeats upon the Revolutionaries earlier that year. It was a long shot, with what limited resources he had under his command, ...but Washington realized that he just might have a chance at a much-needed victory, ...if all went as planned. Surely he did not expect his operation to result in one of the most one-sided victories in military history!

Washington made his proposal to his subordinates. Most of them were vehemently opposed to the operation, given all the factors involved. The weather was abyssmal, intense cold and freezing rain. To get to Trenton, they had to cross the Delaware River, which was already full of large chunks of ice, and a limited quantity of boats.

Despite the various obstacles, they adapted, improvised, and overcame.

They moved their ragged, starving, inexperienced army across the water, marching all night, cold and drenched to the bone! Many of these fellows didn't have shoes. It rained most of the way. The gun-powder was too wet to fire their rifles and muskets. Only the artillery had dry powder, ...which they used to great effect.

This factor makes the nature of this victory at Trenton even more amazing:
The Revolutionary army fixed bayonets, and rushed the town, KILLING the much more proficient enemy at CLOSE-QUARTERS! The completely surprised Hessian troops had just spent the previous night drunkenly carousing and feasting on Christmas Eve. Not one of them expected to be impaled by bayonets in the morning! Not one Revolutionary soldier was killed or injured in the attack on Trenton! Needless to say, ...this victory had the desired result on American morale.

The man who delivered this Christmas Present to America was OUR Founding Father, ...George Washington!
He succeeded because he was assisted by REAL MEN who were determined to accomplish this mission.

The real signifigance of this movie:
There have been several moments in the history of America, at home and abroad, where the nation faced seemingly overwhelming enemies, and abyssmally dire circumstances. This film portrays one of the first of such incidents. REAL AMERICANS take action. They lock and load, fix bayonets, ...and by the grace of God force a glorious victory from what was presumed to be an ""inevitable"" defeat. Be thankful that we had a REAL AMERICAN in command on Christmas Day of 1776!"
5406,767023765,5,"The information appears to be as accurate as it can be, in uniforms, weapons and conditions, in which this country was formed.  Realize that over time, written as well a sthe spoken word, can be misunderstood.  Still felt that it was a very interesting documentory."
5407,767023765,5,"I've read several histories of Washington and/or the Revolution, including ""Washington's Crossing"" by David Hackett Fischer - a very good book and surprisingly easy to read - and ""1776"" by David McCullough, which covers the Battle of Trenton in detail. This film - despite some revisionism - is an excellent portrayal of the crossing and the Battle of Trenton.  Jeff Daniels does a surprisingly good job of characterizing Washington's demeanor, patriotism and dedication to the ""Glorious Cause"", as most revolutionists of the time called our American Revolution. After all Daniels is not new to portraying historical military figures, having portrayed Joshua Chamberlain in ""Gettysburg"" and ""Gods and Generals"". In fact the acting by the entire cast is uniformly good throughout. Despite his dedication and patriotism, Washington had surprisingly little military experience before taking command and had to learn as the revolution evolved. Trenton was his first real battlefield success. Washington came very close to losing his army; and we came very close to losing the Revolution in 1776. It was mostly due to Washington's determination and daring that we were able to continue fighting instead of going down to an inglorious defeat. This movie does a good job of telling that story...it is an excellent film and an excellent history lesson. I think General Washington would have smiled and nodded in agreement after watching this."
5408,767023765,5,A really great movie that keeps you riveted.  Does a great job at depicting just how ragged and ill Washington's troops were by this point in the war.  When you see just how close the entire endeavor was to defeat it makes you astounded that we sit here now 50 states strong.  With this one offensive Washington truly snatched victory out of the mouth of defeat.
5409,767023765,1,The first ten to fifteen minutes of this movie had so much cursing in it our Family could not finish it. This movie IS A VERY POOR PORTRAYAL of George Washington's character!  It makes him out to be a fool instead of the person he himself was.  We shredded it so no one else would be subject to its filth and lies.
5410,767023765,3,"The history protrade was amazing, but the actor playing Washington did not fit my view of him.  At first it was frustrating to watch him until I started focusing on the history that was being shown and then it was unbeliveable what they went through to accomplish what they did.  Also, my understanding of Washington was that he was a very God fearing man and would retreat into the woods or pirvate places to ask for guidance from God.  None of this was protrade.  With out divine intervention the victory would never have happened."
5411,767023765,5,My son saw this movie in history class and enjoyed it so much he wanted it for home.  Could not get it in stores but Amazon not only had it but had it at a reasonable price.  Really good movie about George Washington as a general in battle before he became president.  A must see!  We enjoyed it too.
5412,767023765,5,No close captions! No subtilies! pissing me off still.. end up gave that dvd to my mom. I love this movie.. I remember when I saw it on television once... man! freaking pissing me off when found out has no captions!
5413,767023765,5,Jeff Daniels IS Washington.  Got tired of watching it on my old VCR and bought the DVD to watch it on my wide screen.
5414,767023765,5,Will not will any awards but if you like American history you will find it entertaining. A different look at history.
5415,767023765,5,Jeff Daniels' performance is superb.  Very believable portrayal of one of several events very  early in our American Revolution that turned the tide from imminent failure to real hope for success.
5416,767023765,5,Loved the historical accuracy and who wouldn't like Jeff Daniels as George Washington.  Thank goodness he didn't stand up in the boat
5417,767023765,5,This book is very well done. The events were described in detail. I have read books on the subject and this movie is right on.
5418,767023765,5,Anyone with even a remote interest in the American Revolution with enjoy this DVD.  Few Americans realize how close this nation came to losing its bid for independence from Great Britain.  It was Washington's bold raid on Trenton that resurrected the American cause.  Never before or since has our country been so close to utter defeat and needed a military victory more.  This film offers a detailed and entertaining glimpse at this incredible feat of arms.  Jeff Daniels is excellent in the role as our first Commander-in-Chief.  The production values are good as well.  It's almost like looking back over 200 years at an event as it was happening.  This docudrama is well worth the modest price that Amazon charges!
5419,767023765,5,I highly recommend this dvd. It is one that I can watch over and over again as a reminder of our heritage and the integrity and courage of those that founded our country.
5420,767023765,5,I have seen the movie before after getting it from the library. So I am happy to have the movie. Thank you very much
5421,767023765,4,Very well acted and the action was above average.  Was better than the regular TV fair.  Not sure of all the historical accuracy but movie flowed well and seemed well acted.  Always been a fan of Jeff Daniels so maybe a little biased.
5422,767023765,5,I love this movie. great acting and very well done. I would definitely replace this movie if it becomes damaged
5423,767023765,5,"ABout the only movie, TV or otherwise that really covers this event and the ice and snow scenes were well done, got cold just watching it."
5424,767023765,5,"This is an incredible and accurate portrayal of Washington's Crossing the Delaware, and his remarkable defeat
of one of the World's best armies - the Mercenary Hessians - in the 18th Century - from which the British
never recovered, and made the first reversal which resulted in victory! Most important, how General Washington
literally got off of his high horse, dared to sit as an equal in a row boat with some of his most common soldiers,
and led them to victory!  America needs more ""boots-on-the-ground"" leadership like this today!"
5425,767023765,5,"WE REALLY LIKED IT.  I WISH IT HAD BEEN LONGER.  THE ACTORS WERE GREAT!  PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT AMERICAN COLONISTS WERE HAVING CHRISTMAS DINNER WHILE THEIR ARMY WAS COLD, HUNGRY, ETC."
5426,767023765,5,"I never saw ""Dumb and Dumber"" an earlier Jeff Daniels comedy and maybe that's a good thing because I had no preconceived opinions of Mr Daniels.  Had I never even heard of that movie I would have thought that Mr Daniels spent his early years in the theater doing Shakespearian plays, he is THAT good!  How is it possible that anybody could take such a boring subject as Washington crossing the Delaware and turn it into a totally realistic trip back in time to a place and event that has become a clich' over the years?  This movie should be shown in American history classes.  I've watched this movie 3 times and will watch it at least 3 more times I'm sure."
5427,767023765,5,"One of my favorite movies.  Have shared and recommended it to many
others, too.  Jeff Daniel is incredible as G.W.  Being somewhat of a
student of history, I found his portrayal to humanize the Great Washington
as never before.  Highly recommended to all!"
5428,767023765,5,"This film is fantastic!  Jeff Daniels is the best George Washington I have ever seen!  The conversations convey the type of speech used in that colonial period, yet are understandable today.  The research that went into the costumes and props is phenomenal and makes the film look very authentic.
The cast is wonderful, and this film is inspirational!
For those who love this movie and would like to read more, I would recommend Thomas Fleming's exceptional book Washington's Secret War.  Having seen this movie, you will feel like you know this George Washington personally, as you turn the pages."
5429,767023765,5,"My husband had seen this on TV and really liked it so I got it for him as a Birthday suprise. He was thrilled Thank You,"
5430,767023765,1,"Just saw The Crossing tonight.  I'm a huge Jeff Daniels fan.  I thought the scenery and costumes were great, battle recreations great, but as a whole the film fell short.  Numerous historical inaccuracies and important omissions, and a seeming obsession to make sure we knew that every character in the plot was a bawdy-talking, cussing, irreverent man of the world.  It was really over the top.  No way will I show this to my kids; not just that the cussing is excessive, but it's probably historically inaccurate and the portrayal certainly unbalanced.  In fact, at times the course language seemed to become the main POINT of the film rather than the historical significance of what was happening.  And we know from numerous histories and accounts written at the time by eyewitnesses that even though Washington had a bad temper, he restrained it and only used curse words on rare occasions (historical accounts indicate the shock by his staff when he cursed out Gen. Charles Lee at the Battle of Monmouth, because it was so uncharacteristic of him to use foul language and he actually ordered his soldiers not to do so).

Historical inaccuracies and important omissions abound: After the battle, Washington orders a retreat back across the Delaware; in reality, the army stayed in NJ and laid another trap for the British which ended up in a follow-up victory at Princeton.  And the attack on Trenton also included a planned second crossing that never materialized, adding drama that this film ignored.

On top of that, Daniels' portrayal of Washington seemed off compared to what you read by men of the time, including the soldiers who fought with him.  He was known as a hard man, but a also a gentleman much loved by those around him (other than the ambitious would-be usurpers); but in The Crossing, he just comes across as a hard man, and at times a jerk.  It was not a portrayal that seemed credible--who would follow this guy into battle?

Finally, and perhaps worst, we end with a totally fictional bit of ideological, PC revisionism when American Gen. Nathaniel Greene scolds Washington for his idealism, reminding him that the Revolution is all about the Colonists' greed, which Greene says is no different than that of the Hessians.  What??  That was the last straw for me.

The Crossing isn't a good history lesson at all, other than the outdoor scenes.

Hugely disappointing."
5431,767023765,5,"I show it to my students every year and I still enjoy watching it with them.  A few curse words, but not too bad."
5432,767023765,5,"Jeff Daniels does a lot of movies, spanning a lot of types of roles.  But believe me... it's hard to believe that this is the same guy who played in Dumber & Dumber.  THIS is a man playing GEORGE WASHINGTON... and while I'm in no way a history buff, I LOVE his portrayal of General Washington, and the whole story of the Deleware crossing, and how that one tiny thread of incredibly fated success turned the whole tide of the Revolutionary War.  Awesome movie... awesome acting... and not typical for the types of movies he plays.

The on-line purchase experience was excellent.  :-)"
5433,767023765,5,"I love programs of this type. I thought it was quite enjoyable, despite the feeling that it could have been given a more in depth treatment. The Crossing by Howard Fast, upon which the program claims to be based was more of a rousing tale. To be fair, I generally am always a bit dissapointed when I view a movie based upon a book after having read the book, I generally prefer to find books listed as the source for a show I enjoyed, which always provides for me an enriching experience."
5434,767023765,4,"A story that every American needs to here. The supporting characters personalities are portrayed very well and accurate for the time period. Jeff Daniels does a solid job as Washington, but I was surprised at the crassness of language the screen writers added. I am not saying that Washington never spoke in such a manner, but in all the books that I have read, I have never come across a time that Washington spoke in such a manner. Still, the story is incredible... and true."
5435,767023765,5,"No problems. Jacket and disc in good. Jacket has no rips, stains, dents, or other major problems. Disc plays with no glitches, pauses, etc."
5436,767023765,5,"this movie was done great, never new it existed, friend at work told us about it, recomend it to anyone with an interest in history"
5437,767023765,5,"I was especially interested in the Crossing to find out the historical background of Emanuel Leutze's painting ""Washington Crossing the Delaware"", painted in 1850 and 1851. The DVD is thrilling, however I missed the ice floes painted so beautifully by Leutze and snow on the battlefields."
5438,767023765,5,Very well done! This movie held my attention all the way through!. The acting was right on and very historical correct!
5439,767023765,5,"I never knew what brought on the Revoluntionary war and George Washington inspired me because he never gave up, he continued fighting even if the storage of men and ammo."
5440,767023765,5,"Excellent movie!
Acting was very good.
I loved getting to know the historical characters .
Movie was well done. One I can watch over and over again"
5441,767023765,5,"As far as historical films made on the Revolutionary War which are few and far between, broadcast first on A&E, provides a satisfactory overview of the leadership of Washington and the determination of the Continental Army. The acting is superb, and no one outshines each other. You become taken in by each player and the parts they participate in with the operation, which is the famous crossing of the Delaware River into Trenton,New Jersey to defeat the Hessian Mercenaries. I enjoy the sense that although this may not be absolutely accurate in all details, I do get the feeling that this is about as close to what it was really like with the conditions they faced. Gritty and raw, coarse language abounds but it also invokes the reality and urgency of the threat that Washington faced as the British were bearing down on his downtrodden group of soldiers. The film leaves you with a sense of great pride and wonderment of the spirit of patriotism."
5442,767023765,3,"I am a bit of an American War Of Independance buff and this movie at least attempted to address one fault shared by most films on the subject, the Rebels themselves or Patriots is perhaps a better word were not all naturalised Yankee Accented Americans. Apart from Al Pacino's messy film, Revolution, every film i had seen until this one had the usual upper class Brit accent for the Redcoats and Traditional American drawl for the Patriots. The ranks of the Continental army included Ex-British soldiers and officers of the French Indian war,outraged by the policies and taxes levied by King George. Imagine the anger these men must have felt at having fought the French to protect King Georges interests in America, only then to be asked to pay for the pleasure through unfair and extortianate taxes. Add to this British settlers equally outraged at not being allowed to be represented in Parliament, plus naturalised Americans, Irish, Scots, Dutch, French and German settlers. Two contrasting scenes show the divisions within the American Colonies. When George Washington tells the owner of the boats he is borrowing them, the boat owner protests and tells the Continental Army that they are all mad and will hang. Contrast this with the Englishman who offers George Washington and his Officers the use of his house for shelter and food. Whilst i enjoyed this movie, particularly the portrayal of Washingtons officers having varying American,English,Scottish and Irish accents, i thought one scene was absolutely unescessary and it is fictional. Horatio Gates was as as British as they come, but he did join the fight against his King and became a celebrated though sometimes controversial figure of the Revolution. Most of the controversy is based on his opposition to George Washingtons military tactics, Gates favoured Guerilla tactics in the early stages as he was of the opinion, and its a well founded one, that the Continental Army at this stage was neither strong enough or equipped to fight Redcoats or Hessians head on. Of course we know that on this occasion he was proved wrong, but the scene where he is ordered out of the camp under threat of being shot is pure fiction. Gates left of his own accord but i got the feeling that the Director or screenwriter realised that they hadn't show a stereotyped bad-guy Brit in the movie and decided to add this scene to address that. Portraying Gates as a pompous snob was off the mark and an insult to a man who distinguished himself during the war. Still I just hope that one day someone will produce at last a decent movie or mini-series which accurately portrays a defining point in World history. But most of all a film needs to be made which pays tribute to the men and women of that period in history who suffered so much to give birth to a new nation, it needs to show that Americans were born of a variety of peoples and nations within the former colonies. Perhaps another thing which should be looked at is the effect on the Revolution on both sides of the Atlantic, in England the Colonists had provoked a lot of sympathy amongst the working class and even Fifth columnists had formed to oppose King George, so much about this conflict remains unexplored on film and its a shame. It was all of these things, a struggle for human rights, equality, freedom. greed,ambition and even as suggested by many historians, a civil war. Probably the most complex and fascinating War or Conflict in history, surely one day filmakers will do it justice ?"
5443,767023765,5,"I'd seen this movie on A&E many years ago and wanted it in my collection. Despite a low budget it is an excellent historical piece. The movie brings history to life. We need more movies like this so that children will appreciate the sacrifice that has been made for us.

You'll want this movie in your collection. Please add your vote."
5444,767023765,1,"I was EXTREMELY disappointed in this book.  My son is both a writer and an historian, and this DVD was shallow and the language beyond earthy.  It was vulgar."
5445,767023765,5,"another hard movie to find but a great one about our greatest president and genral the country has ever had gen george washington who is played by jeff daniels,product was shipped fast and in excellent condition"
5446,767023765,5,"SO many people have done great reviews.  My heart goes out to the soilders who were freezing, had no food or shoes. If one stops and thinks about the sacrifices
of 1700's americans, it makes you appreciate more than ever all your blessings.
I admire the revolutionary generation (more than anyother generation)for their bravery and laying ground for americans 200yrs later."
5447,767023765,3,"Overall, I was very impressed with this production focusing on a single and important event in a long, hard war.

In this movie, none of Washington's men were lost. In ""Washington the Warrior"", 6 of his men were lost. Which is correct? I think the latter. Despite the creative licence taken by the producers and writers, there is still much about this that is factual and the performances were impressive. I bought this as part of the History Channel Founding of America box set and I'm still working my way through the DVDs.

This and Washington the Warrior were very well done,  but  do  not  waste  your  time  on the ""founding fathers"" and ""founding brothers"" History Channel DVDs. I don't think the Karl Marx fan club could have made a worse presentation of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. It was a ridiculous assault disguised in the form of a historical production. Seriously biased against small government Jefferson and Madison and drooooling over big government, American Monarchy advocating Hamilton. Garbage."
5448,767023765,1,"TV History reveals new and fascinating facts, either hitherto unknown, or previously ignored.

Viewers are informed, twice, that at least two general officers in the Continental Army shaved with cold water, one of them being the army's commander-in-chief.

While Treasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton became legendary for his hospitality, and especially for the generous helpings served to guests on a groaning dinner table. His expertise in carving a roast may have originated years earlier in a small cabin on the outskirts of Trenton, New Jersey, where the inventor of American banking put aside his duties as colonel of artillery to slice up a half dozen Hessians.

Colonel Rall, commanding the Germans, certainly took his time getting dressed for work. All those enemy troops storming past his bedroom window don't seem to have distracted him from getting his necktie on straight.

By contrast, Colonel Glover is portrayed as somewhat of a fashion emergency. And at the pivotal conference prior to the Battle of Trenton, he makes a scattered, rambling, speech on wig etiquette.

Among the hardships suffered by the Continental Army's rank-and-file, a shortage of pipe tobacco appears to be a close runner-up to the shoe shortage: They're reduced to toking up cornsilk.

Bookseller turned ballistics expert Henry Knox is relegated to comic relief, a sort of Oliver Hardy in period costume.

And those poor Hessians can't seem to escape the slur that they were hung-over on duty. Not much truth to this, ditto for the ""mercenary"" label these hapless losers can't seem to shake. When it comes down to it, they were shanghaied. But never mind, movies are about entertainment. Whoever choreographed their antics must have had a sense of humor: With those outlandish uniforms, they pass for Keystone Cops. And the extras really seem to enjoy hamming it up.

After an hour and a half of loopy dialogue and low-budget props, I did manage to score a few laughs. But wait. Something was missing. This film was shot up in Canada. So why isn't there any snow and ice? Wasn't that the whole thing about Trenton? The harrowing night march and daring assault in the dead of Winter?

There is a redeeming moment. Reality intrudes when one of Washington's staff suggests that all wars are basically about money. The famously stony Father of His Country nods in grudging agreement."
5449,767023765,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie version of the historic event it recreates.  I never had a great appreciation for this event, and it's significance in U.S. history, until seeing this movie.  Sure, you should always verify the facts, since movies often take liberties with the facts, but this one was pretty close.  Also enjoyed the moments of humor, like Glover's slight on General Knox.  You can't help but smile. :)"
5450,767023765,4,"If you're looking for an interesting video on the battle of Trenton, but not concerned with a factual depiction of this event, you won't be disappointed.

This is the only video I could find on the Battle of Trenton and I was looking to show it in history class.  This video is useful in a classroom setting, but there is some minor profanity.

The highlight's of this video are:
Washington's discussion with his fellow commanders- Their reactions are well portrayed, especially that of Horatio Gates.
The actual battle itself- Many assume there was no fighting at Trenton, but this video (although inaccurate in many ways) shows that fierce fighting did indeed take place.
The actor who plays Henry Knox- Fat and funny, he provides some humorous moments.

Some of the details left me wondering if the producers of this show did any research on the Battle of Trenton.
Alexander Hamilton was not General Washington's personal aide, and he did not storm the Hessian guardhouse and slaughter five soldiers with only his sword.  Where this came from, I have no idea.

The scene after the conclusion of the battle shows Washington asking how many casualties were sustained at the battle.  A fellow commander replies, ""none sir.""  Two continental soldiers did die of exposure on the ten mile march to Trenton.

Some important details were left out, many were distorted, but this is entertaining and the actors were well cast.

5451,767023765,2,"I really wanted this to be as good as the other reviewers said it was, but I was really disappointed. I didn't get any insights into Washington's character, what gave him strength. The movie completely ignores Washington's faith in God. There was some unnecessary vulgarity as well. I bought this to help teach my kids about their country's roots, but this movie was no real help at all and a waste of money."
5452,767023765,4,"Although it has some minor errors, overall the true story of what these incomparable men did still amazes me. Where could we possibly find such citizens today? I think that anyone who has studied the revolution and has tried to imagine the sacrifice and hardship these people endured would, or should, have a deeper respect for our nation. Sadly, given the present attitude in America, this isn't the case."
5453,767023765,1,"I agree the the reviewer's comments that Daniels is miscast as Washington. No one would take him for a Virginian; rather like the old Disney production of the Swamp Fox played by a young Lesley Nielson with a New York accent. Also Welsh actor Roger Rees with an English accent plays the Scottish general Hugh Mercer who had to flee Scotland for supporting Prince Charlie.

One of the worst and unexcused errors is when Washington asks after the battle: ""how many killed?"" ""None"" (correct). ""How many wounded?""  ""none"". Incorrect. There were four wounded one of whom, the most seriously wounded was a young lieutenant in the 3rd Virginia named James Monroe. Fifth president of the United States. Worth mentioning I would think."
5454,767023765,3,"I enjoyed this DVD to a degree.  Yes, there are some factual errors (I won't regurgitate the reviews of others); but the visual history is presented very well.  My biggest issue with this film is Jeff Daniels' acting.  His crossing from comedy to drama is not as smooth as Washington's across the Delaware.  It's not that I dislike Daniels; I think he is very good in certain roles.  But in his portrayal of George Washington, I am left unconvinced."
5455,767023765,3,"Good for 8th and 11th grade students to watch when discussing the American Revolution. Some factual information regarding Washington is wrong, especially the way he is shown toward his troops.  There is definitely artistic license and some more conservative historians might take offense, so when teaching this movie with the Revolution so definitely, even though not rated, be sure to present the conservative view and get parent sign off due to the language and content.  Excellent movie to show the hardships and nuances of Revolutionary era."
5456,767023765,4,As far as movies go about the American Revolution this is one of the few that kinda try to get it right. A few historical inaccuracies but overall I enjoyed it very much. If your a fan of the American Revolution I'd reccommend this.
5457,767023765,5,Everyone needs to see this to awaken their sense of our American history.  It is amazing we are a republic and not a territory of England - makes one realize the revolution for freedom was driven from above.  also see John Adams
5458,767023765,1,"This low budget film about Washington's surprise attack on the Hessians in Trenton is probably as bad as it get's. Jeff Daniels is miscast as Washington, and what's with the Cap'n Crunch hat he's wearing? Though this picture could be nit picked to death the attack on Trenton is a huge disappointment. The Americans walk unopposed into Trenton and even have time to set up their cannons and place their troops just right. The fighting starts after the Americans practically have to wake the hung over Hessians up. It's sad that this myth was made part of the film. How anyone could give this more than two stars let alone five is mindboggling."
5459,767023765,3,"I liked the story line, the actors but could have done without some of the cursing."
5460,767023765,5,"I am impressed with the content of ""The Crossing"".  Very educational and entertaining.  The acting is very well done and the historical content is not disturbed. I am a big fan of Howard Fast and this movie only strengthens that notion."
5461,767023765,5,"As a history teacher, this is one of 2 movies I show to my classes every year.  It is definitely worth watching for purely entertainment purposes, but it is also extremely educational.  It brings the remarkable battle of Trenton to life in a way that textbooks cannot.  I watch this movie 7 times a year, but the ending still gives me chills every time."
5462,767023765,1,"I did not receive the product I purchased and I'm pretty upset with the delivery process. I have USPS looking into it. Please expedite the delivery or send it again. This time, let it not be a whole month for me."
5463,767023765,5,"Jeff Daniels had brought to life previously a great figure in American history by his masterful job as Joshua Chamberlain in 'Gettysburg'. In 'The Crossing' he takes on a even larger icon from the American past and pretty much knocks it out of the park. George Washington has always been one of my favorite historical characters, I think pretty highly of him. I think that he and his men were the glue that held the American Revolution together. Washington could have been a dictator but wasn't. His character and devotion to country are the stuff legends are made of.

'The Crossing' finds Washington at a critical time when he is at low ebb after the humbling defeats around New York. The war effort is portrayed in a very unromantic life. This was a war that America lost more battles than it won. But Washington at Christmas 1776 had a ace up his sleeve and the rest as they say is history. Daniels dazzles as Washington and portrays him as a very human character and shows his great temper that Washington usually kept under wraps. His dry humor is also a nice touch. I also like the bringing to life of the nearly forgotten John Glover ,by Sebastian Roch, and the true bravery of his men and what they sacrificed for the cause without their efforts little would have been possible. Roger Rees also does a nice job as Washington's friend Hugh Mercer. Mercer was one of the ancestors of George S. Patton of World War II fame, for a little trivia.

The film captures the cold of winter well and is a DVD to watch in December-January when the leaves have fallen off the trees and you have a warm crackling fire inside. This film captures that tough winter well and the spirit of the men who remained and the great leader who led them in one great roll of the dice. I wish more films were made about our Revolution.

The DVD has good picture and sound plus an interesting little 'making of' the film as an extra.

Highly recommended!"
5464,767023765,4,"Fairly well done, except for the rather rough language that the real Mr. Washington would never have used.
For a more realistic look at of our first president ,I recommend the movie John Adams.
Mr. Washington was a true gentleman."
5465,767023765,5,"As our schools manage to do a poorer and poorer job of educating our youth about America, movies like this one can help teach our kids about American history.  George Washington was one of the giants of history, and this film is a dramatization of one of his many great achievements -- the Battle of Trenton.  Leading a small, discouraged, and cold and hungry American militia Army, Washington took on the finest soldiers in the world and won a great victory.  Had he not done so, the American revolutionary cause might well have failed.  History correctly records that it was George Washington whose inspired leadership won the Battle of Trenton.

Jeff Daniels does splendidly as George Washington, and the supporting caste is also quite good.  The film moves at a brisk pace, never drags, and engages the viewer's interest at all times.  Highly recommended."
5466,767023765,5,My father and I have been looking for this movie on DVD for a while.  Amazon was the best option out there. They offered the lowest priceses and it was easy to order.  The movie was great and we enjoy watching it on weekends as a family.  Thank you so much Amazon!! I plan to order more DVDs from your site!
5467,767023765,3,"This movie was well made, but had too much swearing in it. I understand that they were soldiers, but George Washington was a Christian and would not have spoken with so many profane words. We were only interested in the historical content of the film, but would only watch it once."
5468,767023765,1,"Why is it that people feel the need to use so much foul language when trying to express themselves? It isn't necessary and is quite offensive! I was looking forward to seeing this movie because of all the rave reviews but chose not to sit through it because of the poor choice of language. What a wasted opportunity for a realistic, accurate family oriented history lesson!!"
5469,767023765,2,"I recently saw the HBO miniseries ""John Adams"" and was compelled to watch this movie for a different perspective on a portion of the same period.  Like most American schoolchildren, my familiarity with the crossing of the Delaware at Trenton was limited to the famous painting of that event which shows General Washington perched imperiously in the prow of a boat while being rowed through icy waters in the dead of night.  The reality was decidedly less cinematic; unfortunately, so is this made-for-television treatment.  Admittedly, I was spoiled by the superior production values of ""John Adams"" beside which this production pales.  In its favor, it does present a grittier version of life in the Continental Army than we are accustomed to seeing and does much to humanize the deified personage of its Supreme Commander.  But the production was hobbled by obvious budget constraints and prosaic camera work that make it look very like the TV project it was.  This decisive battle that turned the Revolution in the colonialists' favor is portrayed as little more than a skirmish between Washington's ragtag band of volunteers and a bunch of unsuspecting drunks.  Maybe in truth that's all it was, but the amateur look of this production does nothing to elevate the action into something a little more noble.  It appears that the fate of the Revolution hinged on little more than a brawl.  But it was a brawl the fledging nation desperately needed to win, and Washington is revealed as a crafty stratetician who was willing to risk all on a breathtaking gamble all others dimissed as insane.  The isolation of Washington's command is portrayed with numerous references to the utter lack of support for Washington from the very body that had authorized him to carry out this war.  Citizens of the Republic in the present day may take comfort (or not) in the knowledge that from its very earliest incarnation, the Congress honed its reputation as a bunch of blow-hard self-promoters who existed to endlessly debate but not to act.  Also shown is the in-fighting among Washington's generals, some of whom resented his authority and in some cases, plotted actively to undermine it.  As Washington, Jeff Daniels successfully gives the 'statue' flesh and bone.  He has a wonderful physicality for the role and looks every part the vigorous and devotion-inspiring leader in his prime.  More problematic is his delivery, which sounds too much of the contemporary Midwest (Daniels is a Michigan native) and not much at all like the 'gentleman from Virginia.'  In general, I am not in favor of American actors larding up their dialogue with distracting accents, but though Daniels looks great, he does not sound convincing as a Tidewater aristocrat.  In contrast to the mostly British supporting cast with their more elegant diction, Daniels is rough-hewn and out of his element.  He also delivers his lines very s-l-o-w-ly; one hardly thinks Washington, in the heat of battle for his life and the Republic would have been so laconic. The teleplay by Howard Fast (based on his novel of the same name) displays a tin ear for authentically colonial-sounding dialogue, with many 20th century anarchronisms creeping in, and it presents the greatest obstacle for the actors.  Some worthwhile moments of content, but stylistically this could have done better by its subject."
5470,767023765,5,"This movie was well done on every level. Good script, believable acting, excellent editing, great direction. I really liked the way Jeff Daniels portrayed Washington -- strong, understated and always believable. This movie works on every level and absolutely makes you feel like you're ""there"".  When a historical drama is able to make you feel transported back through time, it has succeeded."
5471,767023765,4,"In all honesty, I expected this to be a so-so movie, however it turned out to be well done and very enjoyable. Jeff Daniels gives a wonderful performance as Washington and lifts the movie above the usual mediocrity of most made-for-TV-movies. All too often, actors are cast to play historic characters they just do not fit. In this case, not only does Daniels bear a passable resemblance to Washington, but he conveys the concern, insecurity, impatience, and determination the general admitted to feeling in his letters and correspondence.

I enjoy reading about history, particularly the colonial/Revolutionary War period, and am generally wary of historical movies due to their tendency to fudge on facts. While I do not claim to be a historian, I found The Crossing to be pretty accurate. I do wish they had brought in more soldiers since the battle scene appeared somewhat skimpy in that regard.

The sets and costumes fit comfortably with the time setting, as does the language and mannerisms. The picture is clear and clean, not distorted by fading colors or other problems. While it was made for TV, I did not find the breaks to be annoyingly obvious as with some. The DVD includes extras, including an interesting account of the movie being made, as well as interviews. One part shows how stunt men made the battle scenes appear real- something younger viewers might enjoy.

There is neither objectionable language in the movie, nor any sexual themes. The battle is not particularly bloody or violent, but would probably be PG if rated. It would make a nice addition to a homeschool history curriculum as well as the family video library. I will certainly be watching this movie again."
5472,767023765,5,"although a bit slow in some places, I thought the portrayal of Washington was excellent."
5473,767023765,5,"I saw The Crossing when it first appeared on A&E and loved it. Jeff Daniels plays George Washington just the way I picture the ""Father of our Country"". Other characters are equally as good and the picture is put together well. I enjoyed seeing the making of the film on the DVD version which I did not have on the VHS version I have owned for years.

One thing nice about the film is that it is 90 minutes long. I am quite often too short on free time to watch a movie but 90 minutes works out real well.

If you are interested in The American Revolution, get a copy of The Crossing. If you like the film, buy the book. It gives you more detail. Then buy the book Washington's Crossing which very good, also."
5474,767023765,5,My husband has wanted this movie for quite some time and was really thrilled to receive it for Christmas.
5475,767023765,5,"Two thumbs, way up.  Wonderfully cast, excellant directing and acting.  Great period piece and historically correct.  Ranks up there with Gettysburg and Dances with Wolves.
You can feel the desperation of the hour.  We need more films like this that accurately portray who we are and where we came from"
5476,767023765,5,"Jeff Daniels is a very versatile actor, attested to in his role as George Washington. The next time I watch this it will immediately be followed by ""Dumb and Dumber""."
5477,767023765,5,"This film was inspiring and informative, makes me proud to be an American and grateful to our courageous Continental Army under the command of Gen. George Washington. How much they sacrificed and suffered to win our freedom! This film should be required in the curriculum of all middle and high school students."
5478,767023765,4,"Good films on the Revolution are hard to find.  This one was packed with action and the drama of Washington's last roll of the dice when the odds were so severly stacked against him.  The film is truly worthwhile, if only to further instill some patriotism in your kids and remind yourself what our ancestors went through to gain our independence.  And Washington would be a hard character to play:  unless your Jeff Daniels.  He nails it and truly captured the heroic aspects of that great man."
5479,767023765,4,"There are some historical inaccurracies in this film, to be sure. The Wikipedia entry for the movie has most of them. And like most movies dealing with any war, there are not enough men on the screen to portray the actual number of soldiers involved. Washington had more than 2000 troops when he went into Trenton, up against about the same number of Hessians. Of course, without computer-generated graphics, there's no way a made-for-television movie can portray that.

I have to question the casting of Jeff Daniels as Washington. I know Washington was a flesh and blood person, but somehow Daniels (or perhaps the script he had to work with) does not communicate the gravitas that must have personified Washington. This was a man chosen practically unanimously by the Continental Congress to lead the army. Daniels does not come across as that sort of person.

Although it is known that Washington had a temper, especially in extremis, most of the time Daniels' Washington comes across as merely petulant or even bitchy.

The dialogue between most of the characters seemed at times to be pretty anachronistic. American screenwriters should take a lesson from their British counterparts (Andrew Davies, for example) on how to write 18th Century dialogue that sounds authentic but not stilted or phoney.

Finally, THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. We watched it with our 7 and 9 year olds because they're studying the Revolution in school. We were dismayed by the bad language, sexual references and the over-the-top bloodletting. Why did the director think it a good idea to show closeups of bayoneting and swords going all the way through people? Showing it is one thing -- but closeups? C'mon! At least the DVD should have indicated what's in store so parents could be informed."
5480,767023765,4,"I think Jeff Danials did a surprizingly good job of portraying the hard-to-cast Washington. I wish I had seen more of Glover's boat work getting the canon and horses across, but all in all, it had a good feel about it."
5481,767023765,5,"I give this film five stars despite some of its historical innaccuracies because it is so well produced.  Compare this movie to say something like Mel Gibson's PATRIOT and you have the difference between quality and trash!  The movie conveys the feeling and desperation of Washy's army on its last legs before striking back at Trenton.  Jeff Daniels does a spirted but probably false impression of Washy.  In reality the man was much more stiff and proper than is shown here.  Washy would never use such language in front of the common soldiers!  He rarely lost his temper as well, otherwise the famous tongue lashing of Charles Lee at Monmouth two years later would never have created such a sensation as it did.  Daniels makes Washy much more likeable to the modern audience, but is an flawed portrayal.

The production value of this film is first-rate.  Obviously period re-enactors were used and their dedication to the hobby shows in the correct formations, drills, etc.  The brief skirmish at the beginning with the British probably did not happen so close to the Delaware like that.  Also, the uniforms for the British appear off somehow.  They look like an earlier period, not the 1770s.  Still, it works.  The Hessians are well portrayed, although it would have provided variety if some Musketeer's with their tri-corn hats were shown.  Not all of Rall's men were Grenadiers and Fusiliers!

American losses were actually 2 dead from the march, and 4 wounded from the fight, including Hamilton and Monroe, the latter a future US President!  I don't know why the movie did not convey this.  The effects of Knox's artillery seems also much exaggerated.  Solid shot and cannister was used, not explosive shells as shown here.  Most films on this period fail to show artillery accurately in that regard.  Still, the acting and mood of the film are right on the mark which makes it easily the best Rev War production out there. Too bad it did not go further to show Washy's next great triumph at Princeton where a small British detachment gave him a much harder run for his money.  Still, what we have here is a nice concise work that comes close to converying the actual history of the event.  This is more than most Hollywood productions do these days.  Let's hope future movie producers draw upon this movie for inspiration rather than the PATRIOT and others like it."
5482,767023765,5,The Crossing is an excellent movie.  Jeff Daniels does his usual great job.
5483,767023765,5,"Jeff Daniels did a great job in this movie.

Great supporting cast as well."
5484,767023765,4,"I enjoyed this movie and show it to my American History classes.  The kids liked it.  It is very historically correct.  I have to admit that I kept thinking about Jeff Daniel's Dumb and Dumber character when I saw him as George Washington, I don't think the students noticed.  Other than that distraction.. I would recommend it."
5485,767023765,5,"I purchased this DVD after seeing it on TV. It goes into detail on the true crossing of the Delaware by Washington and his troops during the crucial battle of Trenton, a turning point in the revolutionary war. There is a lot of bloodshed shown -just as it was in real life-.

This DVD may be more instructive than any history book, to a young person wishing to learn more about the revolutionary war."
5486,767023765,3,"I think this film is great for its entertainment value.  Jeff Daniels puts forth an excellent performance as General Washington, and the direction and editing do an excellent job of building suspense during the crossing of the Delaware River.  Even though I knew the outcome, I found myself concerned about the ultimate success of the mission.  That being said, the portrayal of Henry Knox does a diservice to the father of American artillery.  While John Glover and his men did yeomens'work during the crossing, Knox commanded the operation.  It was through his efforts as a leader, working in concert with Glover, that the Americans succeeded in their task. The movie disparages his achievement for comedic effect.  Overall, I recommend this film, but watch it after reading David Hackett Fischer's ""Washington's Crossing"" or David McCullough's ""1776""."
5487,767023765,5,"Unlike The Patriot which was purely made for propaganda purposes, The Crossing, follows a much more pragmatic, realistic, and in effect a more truthful account of events during the American War of Independence (1775-1783).  The film brings to the screen George Washington's first victory during the American Revolution: The Battle of Trenton.

It is December 1776 and the Continentals have yet to score a victory against the British.  Chased by government forces, the rebels find themselves exhausted on the banks of the Delaware river with General George Washington remaining Commander-in-Chief, but of the now remnants of what used to be the Continental Army (once numbering 20,000, now at 2,000 and dwindling).  Subsequently, Washington is faced with yet another difficult choice: does he camp for the winter and hope that he will still have his rank and an army spring come, or does he surprise-attack the city of Trenton, which is in the hands of 1200 crack German troops from Hessen?

The Crossing provides valuable insight into a very important period of American (and British) History. Specifically:

We get a taste (though a very light one) of the different attitudes and mentality of English North American colonists during the war e.g. when the foundry's owner refused to let the Continentals use his boats (before they were in turn confiscated).

Moreover, we get to see or hear about, the double-crossing generals such as General Lee that allowed himself to be caught... and yet not so much about the merchants, farmers, and politicians that supported whichever side the wind happened to be blowing in, always in search of profit and personal gain, which another film, Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor, portrays so well.

The clash between the Loyalist American English and the Continental American English is not really shown, just the one between the Continentals and the British along with their Hessen allies/mercenaries, which is nonetheless fascinating and very well presented throughout the film; but then so is the clash within the Continental side (the undermining, the personality clashes-Washington vs Gates and Lee etc, favoritism-the contingency plan in having Sullivan arrest Lee), as well as the problems between Congress and the Army (there are the subtlest of hints for the latter/Ral's sword sent to Congress).

There is also the brave admission (by G. Washington) that the Continentals lack public support (enlistment being at a minimum, while trying to keep their minutemen from deserting), and the important role that Washington played throughout the Revolution in keeping the Continentals ""alive,"" long enough for the French (1778), Spaniards (1779), and Dutch (1780) to enter the war against Great Britain, and win the war.

Therefore, the movie successfully sheds light on aspects of American History that some would rather keep hidden ""under the carpet.""

As a result, The Crossing, is a daring movie, which shatters more than a few misconceptions, deliberate and not, surrounding attitudes towards the War of Independence, and provides for historical truths, which had been suppressed for long years in the name of ""patriotism.""

The only major setback is in relation to Jeff Daniels who is not that great in his role; Kelsey Grammer was a much better Washington in Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor.

As for the end where it states that: ""The records show that a total of 16,992 Hessians were brought to America to fight the colonists.""  That should be ""...to fight the rebel colonists,"" not forgetting the Loyalists and the Neutrals made up approximately 1/3 each, of the total colonist populace.

In short, The Crossing is a movie definitely worth watching, and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection.

Strongly recommended, especially for History buffs, along with Revolution starring Al Pacino, and Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor, starring Aidan Quinn and Kelsey Grammer. 4.5 Stars"
5488,767023765,5,"quite an excellent view of Washington's crossing coupled with the historical context which showed the importance of winning the early morning battle. Jeff Daniels is excellent as Washington showing both the restraint and natural charisma of the man. Hamilton is a bit overstated but so was the man himself. This was history well done-factual, fast-paced, and entertaining."
5489,767023765,5,"There is an old debate as to which is truer: history or poetry.

The accuracy is surprising, considering that it was adapted from a novel written by an author who generally knows better than to let history get in the way of a good story. In this case, the bending of the facts, mostly in characterization of some of Washington's generals, was relatively restrained, and supplied conflict that was real, if not always attributed to the correct historical person. Thus, the literary license does not get much in the way of history. Many of the small details are correct to an exceptional degree. All the characters, whether historically accurate or not, are well portrayed as people of the time. There is enormous subtlety here.

This is a magnificent expression of the American situation at the time and place.

Which is truer, history or poetry?

The correct answer is: ""Yes.""

This film is both. Don't miss it."
5490,767023765,5,"It is December, 1776. Six months before you were in command of an army of 20,000 men. Now there are only 3,000, most of them unfit for duty, and the British Army is snapping at your heels. In front of the men you still command is the Delaware River, a treacherous river at the best of times and even more dangerous at this time of year. Behind you are the British, so confident of victory that they leave a token force of Hessien mercenaries in Trenton, New Jersey and return to New York for the winter. After all, once the river freezes over, the British Army will march across the ice and hand you the terms of surrender. Your men are ill. Two of your generals are missing, there is no food, no medicine and no shelter. The men's enlistments are over on the 31st of December. You must face reality; the revolution to separate the American colonies has failed. That is what General George Washington faced in December, 1776. Any reasonable man would have surrendered but, as Washington stated, ""I am not a reasonable man."" and, being unreasonable, he does what no one believes possible, he decides to attack the Hessians on Christmas day.

That is what we learn when we study American History. What we do not learn is the true character of the man known as the Father of His Country. A man who was racked with guilt, doubt, and the belief that it is his fault that the American revolution is failing. A man who swears at officers who stay inside and enjoy the warmth of a fire while their men wait in the snow for their turn to get into the boats which will ferry them across the Delaware to New Jersey. A man willing to risk it all to achieve his dream of an independant America.

Yes, there are some mistakes in historial accuracy. General Knox and General Nathanael (Yes,I spelled his name correctly) Greene are portrayed by men older than they were when this battle took place. The members of British Army, seen in the first few minutes of this two hour movie, are wearing the uniforms use in the French and Indian Wars rather than those worn during the American Revolution, and Colonel John Glover's New England accent could use some work but, in my opinion, these minor inaccuracies are just that, minor. The strong language used is accurate for the time period, a fact many Americans do not know. Washington's victory at Trenton turned the tide of history in the colonies and The Crossing shows how victory was pulled from the jaws of despair."
5491,767023765,4,"I purchased this film to use in my classroom while discussing one of the most pivotal moments in the American Revolution.  Upon previewing the film though I was very disappointed in the amount of, what I felt, was unnecessary cursing.  The words, I am guessing, were placed there to help the viewer understand the desperation of the situation, but unfortunately, this made the movie unviewable for my classroom.

With regards to the movie's overall impression; Jeff Daniels does an admirable job as George Washington and projects a very convincing presence.  You are witness to a man who has been beaten and defeated in every battle and skirmish for the last 18 months, and Daniels denotes this very well in his body language and demeanor.  Many of the men who would become his original cabinet are also seen (Hamilton, Knox) by his side in this story.  Would have been a great history lesson had it not been for the language."
5492,767023765,5,"As a non-historian I was enthralled when I first viewed The Crossing on A & E television. As others have written, the story is dramatically compelling due to the quality acting of Jeff Daniels. However, the story is well scripted for supporting roles as well and brings home to a modern audience a sense of the true leadership skills and vision that Washington must have had to keep up under such adversity.  I would recommend The Crossing for students and adults of any background as good entertainment and hopefully a source for reflection on the convictions of our country's founders."
5493,767023765,5,"I saw this movie twice on TV and it held my attention from start to finish.  Well written, well acted, all around well done. I do have one problem with it, however.  I am hard of hearing and use closed captioning.  On TV this movie was close captioned. Unfortunately it is not CC on VHS or on DVD.

You will love this movie if you have good hearing.  I am ashamed of  A&E for putting out a product without closed captioning.  Many of their home versions have the same problem.  Shape up A&E."
5494,767023765,5,"This is an outstanding movie. It brings out the terrible situation George Washington and his men were in. No one in their right mind would have bet on them! But, by trusting Providence ( Washington was not a Christian, he was a Deist [...]  ), fighting as hard as they could, working together and never giving up, they beat the most powerful army on the planet!

The acting is great and it is put together fine. I really enjoy it and I'm very happy I bought it."
5495,767023765,4,"""The Crossing"" was a great made for tv film from the A & E networks.  While some may quibble with the historical accuracy (which in these adaptations there is always something missing that someone doesn't like) it does show the desperation of the forces in the winter of 1776 and how this small victory began to help turn things around in the ""rebels"" favor.  As others have stated Jeff Daniels plays an outstanding George Washington (better than Kelsey Grammar IMHO).  While I think the roles of Knox (at least they got an overweight actor albiet one that is about 15 years older than Knox was at the time) and Greene (also too old for the real Greene) were miscast the rest were fairly well portrayed.  Yes, it would have added to the story to show Rall putting away the note informing him of the  Continental  advance, it's something that isn't really missed (again IMHO).  There are also many historians who quibble over whether or not the Hessians were somewhat hung over or not which was somewhat implied but not shown.  The music does add to the story as others have mentioned.  I show this to my middle school students every year and they seem to enjoy it (it also gives them the opportunity to find the truth vs. fiction in the movie)."
5496,767023765,4,"GW is a very hard man for Americans to warm up to the. The Man is like another Virginian that comes to mind, Robert E. Lee. Both seem to be Marble Men (Not of real flesh & blood). All I can say is Thank God we have men like them when we needed them. Mr Daniels does his best to create the persona of out Founding Father and I feel that he comes pretty close to the mark.

This films captures what I feel is the key moment of Washington's life as a General. In a bold and courageous move he won a good solid victory that helped keep the cause alive. No one else could of done it. I also feel that it showed accurately for a movie at least what ot must of been like to have been there. The uniforms seemed correct as was the weopons and tactics.

  All around a good addition to ones collection."
5497,767023765,1,"The only good thing about this, is Jeff Daniels. He is excellent in serious roles.  Otherwise, it was quite inaccurate, historically.  What about the other 2 attempted crossings?  Where's the militia?  Yes, there were American deaths.  Madison was very seriously wounded. What about the ice in the river?  Henry Knox character was portrayed poorly. And, on and on.  At least, they didn't show drunk Hessians.  What a relief!  Watch it to enjoy Daniels, but ignore the rest."
5498,767023765,5,"This is truly a great movie and I highly recommend it to anyone. Whether you are a history fan or not. This movie depicts an event in American History that needed to be told in detail. Many people are familiar with Washington's infamous crossing of the Delaware River, but do not realize how important of a mission it was. And to what degree of deterioration Washington's army was by the end of 1776. It was literally ""Victory or Death"" for Washington in the final week of the year. His troops enlistment's were almost up, moral was low and Washington desperately needed a victory. So he decided to attack a group of German troops (hired by the British)stationed in Trenton NJ the day after Christmas. Needless to say, the mission was accomplished...

My only complaint about The Crossing was that German leader Colonel Rall was given a message late in the evening on Christmas Day, warning him of the attack . Rall requested not to be disturbed and refused to read the message. He tucked the unread message in his coat pocket. The message was finally read the following day AFTER the attack. This incident was left out of the movie and really needed to be included.  For if Rall had read the letter, he would have been prepared for Washington's attack. Most likely ending the American Revolution right there..."
5499,767023765,5,"The music made this terriffic film perfect- it was just excellent. The dvd also contains a behind the scenes special feature -which was good but not great. Jeff Daniels is great as George Washington, and has an excellent supporting cast. I thought the acting and emotion were terrific in portraying what Washington went through.. his army was being crushed and they needed to cross the Delaware and regroup to save the revolution. Good filming- an excellent production.. This is one of my favorite films."
5500,767023765,5,"Every American should see this film.  They should see, in the dramatic way that a video makes possible , the sacrifices that these earlier people made to give us a free country.
I have often marvelled at the patience and tenacity of Washington through those 7 long years of war.  This film emphasizes his tenacity and just plain ""toughness.""  It also gives us a picture of those few common soldiers who stayed with him through bitter defeat and privation while the majority deserted or otherwise disappeared.  These few made the great difference.  And among these few were fewer still the fishermen from Marblehead who saved the Army in New York making possible the escape march to Valley Forge.  This same close-knit group of men made the difference again at The Crossing.  They knew how to handle boats actually making the crossing possible.
As you watch the film listen especially carefully to the conversations between General Washington (Jeff Daniels) and Col. John Glover (Sebastian Roche).  Col. Glover is the feisty, outspoken officer who often disagrees but who knows how to take orders.  He commanded the Marblehead fishermen without whom Valley Forge and the Crossing would never have taken place.
If you are interested get Howard Fast's ""The Unvanguished.""  This book tells the story of the Marblehead fisherman in New York in detail.  Fast wrote The Crossing including this film script. With Fast's earlier New York battle background you will understand how the Army got into such a desperate situation and Washington's relationship and conversations with Glover in this movie will make all the more sense.  .
The acting is good to very good.  The script is very good.  The story moves along well.  The settings are realistic and well done.  This is no sacrifice. It is real entertainment.  But it could inspire you to a little sacrifice for your country should the need arises."
5501,767023765,2,"The Crossing is really just not a good movie, but I still find it interesting because some of the movie was filmed quite close to where I live; the opening scene when Washington's bedraggled army is marching through a wooded area, and the camp scenes near the beginning of the movie.
To say that the acting in this movie was good would be a slight over-statement, and the dialogue is not what one would call stellar.  I would not be so certain about the accuracy of the movie either--few movies are.  The general course of events may be faithfully adhered to, but no movie based on a historical event that I can think of has not taken liberty with the truth for one reason or another."
5502,767023765,5,"""The Crossing"" is one of the finest TV movies ever made. The movie is superbly cast, and led by Jeff Daniels, who surprised me with his outstanding portrayal of George Washington. Why he wasn't asked to reprise the role in ""Benedict Arnold,"" I'll never know! The crossing of the Delaware River and the Battle of Trenton are created with accuracy and excitement. This is a must-own movie for anyone who enjoys serious films! Grade: A+"
5503,767023765,2,"Although most reviewers found this movie to be very accurate, I find one glaring error.... NO Americans of African decent.  THE FACTS: George Washington himself requested two black oarsmen to accompany him on his boat.  The biographer of ""The Crossing"" made sure he included the action between Henry Knox and General Washington in reference to swamping the boat, but again, no blacks. Please understand, I was excited to finally see a positive portrayal of my heritage displayed on the small screen.  Can you imagine my sadness when seeing we were purposely left out? (Every other aspect of the film was painstakingly accurate.)  I am keeping this short, check the facts and remember we were there!"
5504,767023765,2,"Being a big fan of Jeff Daniels' acting and Revolutionary War drama, I ordered this movie and was very disappointed. The sequence of events is historically accurate but the characters are not very well portrayed. The crudity and obscenity were unbelievable in an unrated movie--in at least two places Washington uses the a-word to refer to someone's behind. Right! In the 1770s they still used that word to refer to a donkey. And we still have a copy of Washington's orders that his troops were to refrain from profanity. It is known under extreme provocation Washington used an occasional four-letter word, but never in casual conversation like in this movie. Stick with true history...try Jeff Shaara's books on the War."
5505,767023765,5,"I can't praise this film enough. Brilliant!
Buy it now! Everything about it is perfect.
It will make you proud to be a human being, not just an American!"
5506,767023765,5,"Excellent, excellent movie!  I have watched it over and over and enjoy it just as much each time.  A&E movies are always well done and this is no exception!  The DVD version, as usual, gives you more for your money with background, actor interviews, etc."
5507,767023765,5,"A&E does a masterful job of putting together a top-notch cast with an event of great importance to the future of the foundling United States of America.
The acting, portrayal of conditions and general lack of support and material for prosecuting a war against Great Britain was well done.  The moral of the Continental Army under Washington was at an all-time low prior to the crossing.  Indeed they had known little but defeat until that time.  Washington even had his doubts about whether some of his chief commanders would even follow orders.
The story of the crossing, the hanging in the balance of the war with Great Britain, and the attack on Trenton are all masterfully done.  Kudoes to A&E.  May they continue to produce more historically based efforts of this quality in the future.
5 stars...don't miss it."
5508,767023765,4,"This is a made-for-TV movie produced by the A&E television network in 2001.  It was adapted from a novel by Howard Fast and I assume it is historically accurate.  It's about a defining moment in American history - that of George Washington crossing the Delaware River and attacking the well-trained German soldiers hired by the British, at Trenton, New Jersey.
I recently visited a friend who lives in that area and walked across the bridge where George Washington made this historic crossing.  Of course there was no bridge back in 1776 on that cold December day -- just the dark and the cold and an ice-filled river.  The Continentals, which was what the Americans were called then, were losing the war. They had not won a battle since they declared independence six months before on July 4.  The troops were weary and starving.  It looked like the American Revolution was lost.
But Washington took a huge risk, and in his own quiet and determined way, made a decision that changed the course of history.  The scenes of the actual crossing were done in fog and shadow, as the boats moved towards the opposite shore.  But there were no scenes that looked like the famous painting with Washington standing in the front of the boat.  In this film, Washington was sitting throughout. Naturally, this made me re-think my own historical perceptions.
Jeff Daniels is cast as Washington, and I found myself very critical of his performance.  He seemed aloof and wooden and, even though there was constant danger, he never lost his cool, calm leadership abilities.  I understand, though, that this is exactly the kind of person that George Washington was. If this is true, then he did portray him well.
Basically, though, even though there was some conflict between the various generals as well as a bit of bawdy language and some violent scenes of swordplay, the film never rose above that of a history lesson, one shown in classrooms or while visiting museums. I tend to like my drama more complex though, and for that reason this film, while well done, has to be viewed for what it is.  I therefore give it a modest recommendation.  It's certainly worthwhile seeing."
5509,767023765,5,"Too often, Hollywood produces ""adaptations"" of historical events--taking the liberty of tossing in threads of irrelevant story lines and unsubstantiated ""fluff"".  Not so with ""The Crossing"".  Jeff Daniels does a supurb job in portraying the caring, persistant, tired, and victorious George Washington.  And the supporting cast was second to none.  This film is a stellar example of how events in history should be documented--and one that you will view more than once.  A true reminder of what our forefathers went through.  And the reason I'm here at this site is because we loaned our copy of ""The Crossing"" to a friend who never returned it.  So I'm getting another one.  This film is definately one for the home collection."
5510,767023765,5,"A&E's The Crossing, starring Jeff Daniels as General George Washington, is one of the best historical productions I have ever seen.  The movie tells of General George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River to attack the Hessians in Trenton, New Jersey on December 25th, 1776.  This is a very important story for Americans to know.  The American War of Independence was almost lost by the end of 1776. In The Crossing, Jeff Daniels with an excellent supporting cast, recreates that period of an American cause in dire straits.  General Washington and his men with pure tenacity, win a critical battle that saved the American army from disintergration.  The acting, atmosphere and music make this production inspirational and top notch.
One of the best historical presentations you will see!"
5511,767023765,4,"My girlfriend and I enjoyed this film and felt as though we'd really seen George Washington.  The film begins in 1776 and ends with the conclusion of the surprise attack on Trenton.  This is one chapter of history we feel intimately acquainted with now.  Although it doesn't seem to have enjoyed a great budget and although it has just a hint of an educational taste to it, the Crossing seems far more historically relevant than films like Patriot or Pacino's Revolution.  Daniels displays incredible posture especially while riding a horse and as a passenger in a boat through all hours of the night and thus quietly impresses upon us the dignity of America's first and fearless leader."
5512,767023765,5,"This is a wonderfully done made-for-cable movie about George Washington and his famous victory at the Battle of Trenton in the winter of 1776.  Starring Jeff Daniels as General Washington, this film brings an important episode in American history vividly to life.  We see the broken remnants of the Continental army as it races to avoid capture following their defeats in New York.  The British, close on the heels of the retreating rebels, have written the Americans off as being on the verge of total surrender. Washington, tired and beaten, realizes that he must make one last attempt to achieve victory or all hope for the revolution will be lost.  Against the judgement of his officers, Washington prepares to launch a desperate offensive against a large force of Hessian troops occupying the town of Trenton, just across the Delaware River in New Jersey. The future of the new United States hangs in the balance as the rag-tag army bets all or nothing on this dangerous gamble.  Well written and with money well-spent, The Crossing is a dramatic telling of this important moment in American history, and one that I would recommend to teachers, students, and history enthusiasts alike."
5513,767023765,4,"During the winter of 1776 members of the Continental Congress abandon Philadelphia and run for their lives as the American Revolution begins to unravel. The Continental Army has lost every battle in defence of its positions, and has never dared to attack the enemy. Now, a american general who is considered to be a buffoon by the British, and ineffective by many of his own officers, is about to lead a ragtag army of 2000 tired, hungry and sick men across an ice-filled river at night to attack the best trained and most feared soldiers in the world. Pulp fiction? Historical fact??
This little gem captures the essence of what many military historians believe to be the most daring battle strategy ever undertaken.
All the cast members deliver solid and convincing performances, especially Jeff Daniels as the brooding and short-tempered George Washington. Although, a couple of the scenes do contain minor historical flaws, even the purist cannot question the overall accuracy of the events unfolding. The sets, period costumes, and battle scenes are accurate even if some of the fight sequences are a bit exaggerated. Robert Harmon's direction is tight, and the photography by Rene Ohashi makes you feel that you are actually there. Gary Chang's music is also very effective in setting the mood for this non-epic film.
This movie is not your typical adulterated hollywood production that plays foot-loose with the facts. It stays on it's historical course as it tells the story of a near-miraculous event that was to become the turning-point of the American Revolution.
The Crossing is a must see for anyone who enjoys historically accurate entertainment."
5514,767023765,5,"At first when I started to see this, i thought its not bad, by the way I was watching this in Social Studies class. This video shows the conditions of the army and the struggles they had to reach FREEDOM!!Everything about this video is correct except for 2 minor parts when Glover i.e. Sebastian Roche  ""We'll give them cold steel."" Steel was not discovered yet. Also when Washintong layed on the bed flat on his back, people back then didn't sleep like that because they'll think you get this sickness or something. Jeff Daniels portrays an excellent George Washington who had a line or two that made me and my class crack up like crazy. Though some of the language is funny, it doesn't make a difference. The only part I have to cover my eyes is when Alexander Hamilton i.e. Steven McCarthy and Williams go into this house and kills 4 Hessians. It was pretty bloody, since friends described it to me. Overall its cool and this video inspired me to do a Social Studies project on the Battle of Trenton, which I won Honorable Mention. Hehe! Here is what I think of the actors:
Jeff Daniels~ he makes a great Washington and its hard to portray Father of Our Country
Sebastian Roche ~ his atitude is really funny in my point of view for Glover, cause Glover is well a thorn to Washington's side...
Roger Rees~ a very convincing Hugh Mercer. He looks a like real loyal friend to Washington.
Steven McCarthy ~ makes a cool young Cap. Alex Hamilton. It looked like his only job was to follow Washington's commands and give the time. Hehe....
This movie is great and I suggest you guys watch it. I saw it the second time on TV on Chrimstas Eve and Day. Waking 7:00am is worth seeing this."
5515,767023765,5,"As with all movies based on historical fact, the yardstick for this movie should be the accuracy presented regarding the battle of Trenton. Based on my somewhat limited reading (Richard Kethchum's ""The Winter Soldiers""), this movie delivers reasonably well. More so, the most truly important aspect of history movies, in my opinion, is the context and how well this given period is presented...in essence, how deeply does the viewer feel involved? This is the issue that makes this movie stand out. Watching this, I felt all the emotions that Washington appeared to go through (desperation, frustration, exhileration upon smashing the Hessians at Trenton...) and just  marveled at the ""period"" depiction. I really felt that this was what it was like in 1776 Pennsylvania and New Jersey (volunteers with no uniforms or warm clothes...some even without shoes in the dead of winter...). Washington's character was well played by Jeff Daniels as he portrayed the important leadership qualities that made him a legend and founding father. Daniels ""playing"" Washington also managed to come across as somewhat flawed (i.e. ""human""...) while giving a semblance of Washington's major desperation. On the negative side, I'm not so sure that Colonel Glover's role was historically accurate, although it was also well acted. In summary, an excellent movie and one that should be viewed by anyone interested in the Revolution. Highest recommendation."
5516,767023765,4,"I often show ""The Crossing"" to my political science classes and invariably they are enthralled.  It is an intriguing, almost shocking film.  The most striking surprise is that Jeff Daniels pulls off a portrayal of the great Washington with humanism, determinism, unparalleled leadership, mixed with a little testiness and bawdiness - in sum, a man with flaws who took his life and his mission seriously, while winning the loyalty of his rag tag troops.
Washington was somewhat wooden, which Daniels again plays well, because he took every aspect of his life with dead seriousness and a clear vision of the nation he almost single-handedly created.  Present at the creation of the new nation, commander in chief, he rallied his men at the battle of Trenton in December 1776, the subject of this film, avenging his early loss of New York City.
The inaccuracies in the film are of little consequence since its essence is Washington.  His audacious crossing of the treacherous Delaware on Christmas eve in the depth of night, completely surprising battle-hardened, but hung-over Hessians, helped turned the tide of the war at a time when America's victory teetered on disaster.  Daniels creates a man, not a myth, giving him just the right amount of stiffness and caring for his men, and a determination that would win the very long war.
James Kidnie as the Hessian Colonel Rall is the perfect foil to Washington.  As the attack rages, he meticulously dresses himself and then panics at the American onslaught, hardly believing his eyes.  Director Harmon's pacing is plodding at times, but the crossing itself is full of suspense, the battle scenes more than passably exciting.  The cinematography and supporting cast are adequate. But the star of this film is Daniels. In sum, a fine A&E production well worth seeing."
5517,767023765,5,"It is very difficult to translate history to modern audiences. People of the past do not speak the same cultural language as modern Americans, or, to be more precise, modern Americans have difficulty understanding the motivations of their countrymen of 50, or 100, or 200 years ago.
""The Crossing"" is an excellent film. I mean that it excels in many respects, but not all. When I first heard that Jeff Daniels, of ""Dumb and Dumber"" infamy, was to play Washington, I slapped my forehead and groaned for history. Hollywood, once again, I thought, would fabricate history--replete with [standard] characters, stooges, faithful sidekicks and villainous bad guys (ala ""The Patriot"")--rather than make an honest attempt at what we know as the facts.
I was wrong. Howard Fast wrote the novel and the screenplay. He is the same fellow who gave us ""April Morning"" and ""Citizen Tom Paine"", among other fiction classics of America's early Revolutionary history. Fast became a socialist, but always revered the spirit and determination of the Founders, which, perhaps, is why he became a socialist. I do not agree with his later political leanings, but I share his respect for the revolutionaries who made America and know we would share a hatred of the tyranny they opposed.
Is this film flawed? It certainly is to the extent noted [....] The screenplay is not accurate in many particulars (Fast was not fastidious in this regard). However, it captures as few films have the spirit of the Revolution, the desperation of the times and the greatness of Washington. Daniels did a superb job, with the strong script, of showing why Washington was the leader he was.
This is an entertaining and informative film for adults, but I think its chief value is as an excellent introduction to America's first hero and the long odds against which the people who made America labored. Their success was a miracle.
If you are looking for a good film to excite your kids about America and her beginnings, pull out a map, show them the Delaware River and ""Washington's Crossing"" just north of Philadelphia and watch ""The Crossing"" with them."
5518,767023765,5,One of the best American-history films I saw. Jeff Daniels' as George Washington is almost perfect' with the supporting cast doing their best. It's a good educational film (American History) for us non-Americans.
5519,767023765,5,"The Crossing is about a small action that became a pivotal point in the American Revolution, the American assault on German mercinary troops in Trenton, NJ.  What struck me was not the audacity of Washington attacking in the dead of winter, but the cooperation of his subordinates that was need to even make this action remotely possible.  This is an ensemble performance that centers around Washington but shows the synergistec effect that was needed to make the attack work.

Jeff Daniels is excellent as Washington pulling his dispirited troops together for a decisive action.  Washington was taking a great risk, maybe the biggest of his career; by making a winter attack.  Armies of this time, rarely, if ever, fought in the winter and Washington was going against convention by doing so.  He was also conducting an amphibious operation which is one of the hardest operations to perform in warfare.  Here the cooperation of others was critical.  If the men under Colonel John Glover were unable/unwilling to give their all, Washington might just as well have stayed in camp.  No boats, no action fairly well sums it up.  Washington's troops could have muddled through and affected a crossing, but the element of surprise, I am sure would have been lost and no surprise meant a harder and more doubtful battle.  Glover is the true unsung hero of the battle and it is good to see him recognized as such.

This film abounds in small points.  The depiction of the Pennsylvania German troops in Washington's command is well done. The state of mind of Washington's troops, ofter overlooked, is shown in great detail.  The use of period sites also was a big plus in the making of this film.

In all, I found this one of the best films about Washington's attack on Trenton and one that gives a new impression of the compexity in executing this battle.  This film should be in the library of every person with an interst in early America."
5520,767023765,5,"While everyone's heard of Washington crossing the Delaware from history class, very little attention is paid to the man who actually made it happen: Colonel John Glover.  Being from Marblehead, it's rather difficult to escape him and his legacy--I briefly attended Glover School, had a dinner at the General Glover House restauraunt in neighboring Swampscott, and once toured the old destroyer USS Glover--and was surprised to learn just how practical and sensible he was in relation to the more well-known Hamilton and Knox: he deliberately remained a colonel while the rest of Washington's command staff were generals, partially due to being abrasive (""What this army needs is more private soldiers, not more generals!"" he declares when Washington remarks on this), wore his own clothes instead of a uniform, and wouldn't stand for any sort of foolishness when it came to his first specialty of seamanship."
5521,767023765,5,"Since I live about 2 miles from Washington Crossing, PA I truly loved this film. The casting was excellent - Jeff Bridges was perfect. There is so much history in the area where I live - each year they do an actual reenactment of Washington Crossing the Delaware with people dressed in authentic uniforms from that era. Any history buff will love this film - that's why I bought it after I saw it on TV."
5522,767023765,5,It's rare you find a movie that's not only educational but entertaining as well.  And I'm not a person who usually watches educational films.  This movie was different.  Gripping and fascinating from start to finish.  This should be REQUIRED watching for all school children!  This movie brings history to life like few others EVER have for me.  My knowledge of Washington crossing the Delaware started and ended with the famous painting.  Now I know the incredible story behind it.  Highly entertaing - and Jeff Daniels makes a wonderful Washington.
5523,767023765,5,"This movie, telling the story of Washington's crossing the Delaware in December 1776, is based on the book by Howard Fast. It gives a vivid picture of the trials of the early period of the Revolutionary War endured by Washington and the men who followed him. Jeff Daniels' portrayal of Washington is gripping. Sebastian Roche as Col. Glover is wonderful. The rest of the cast were well chosen.
One of the most charming scenes is between two of the common soldiers trying to stay warm and dry in a small tent. They discuss the merits of smoking corn silk vs. cow dung in their clay pipes. They are very young and very human
Anyone interested in the history of the Revolutionary War will find that this movie brings the struggle alive, depicting the officers and soldiers as men. The Hessians may be depicted as too mean, but the conversation between their commander, who expresses concern for the treatment of his men, and Washington is touching. This movie ranks with ""Gettysburg"" in its depiction of war in an earlier era."
5524,767023765,5,"This movie, although made for cable, had the drama of a feature motion picture.  Jeff Daniels and the rest of the supporting cast gave outstanding  performances.  This movie has the ability to make you laugh, cry and cheer.  I strongly recomend it, not for it's perfect historical portrayal, but  rather it's telling of history in an accurate, yet entertaining way.  I  wish all American Revolution movies were done so well."
5525,767023765,3,"Overall, I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who has an interest in American history.  Nevertheless, a few of the liberties taken with the characters and historical inaccuracies are too much to warrant a  5-star rating.
Here are just three examples:
1. Washington's Language -  Although Jeff Daniels's portrayal of Washington as a hot-tempered,  foul-mouthed, flawed hero appeals to our modern cynicism and desire to  debunk the myths behind our heroes, there are some serious questions as to  the film's accuracy on this front.  George Washington did have a volcanic  temper, but he had learned to control it - and that was part of the  strength of his character.  The movie depicts him as being almost  constantly frustrated and bordering on an outburst.  This does not reflect  the truth as can be evidenced by the reaction many of Washington's  subordinates had on those RARE occasions when Washington did lose his cool.  Were he as temperamental as Daniels portrays him, the outbursts Washington  DID have wouldn't have been as significant to those around him as they  were.  In addition, the language attributed to Washington in this film is  in direct contrast with Washington's own orders against cursing.  I don't  question the fact that a few words may have slipped now and then, but it's  very inconsistent with the historical record to portray Washington as  foul-mouthed as this film does.
2. Alexander Hamilton was not  Washington's aide at the Battle of Trenton.  He was an artillery captain.  He did not come into Washington's service until later.
3. The exchange  between Horatio Gates and Washington was clearly overblown for dramatic  effect.  It's no secret that the two didn't like each other, but there's no  evidence to support the film's contention that Washington threatened to  have Gates shot.
I don't want my criticisms to make it seem like the  movie had no merit.  Howard Fast and the film's production team do an  outstanding job in showing just how desperate the American situation was  prior to Trenton.  For this alone, the movie is well worth watching."
5526,767023765,5,"I loved this movie.  Jeff Daniels gave a brilliant depiction of a young General Washington.  To truly succeed in our future, we must understand our past.  This movie will enable you to have a glimpse of our country's humble  beginnings."
5527,767023765,5,"In the last 10 years or so, Hollywood and cable TV has finally started to get it right when they make movies (Widescreen or TV) about historical events, and The Crossing is no exception.
This is a well acted account  of one of the major events of the War of Independence.  Jeff Daniels  portrays a superb George Washington, who was at times very impatient and  hot tempered.  History seems to gloss over the imperfections and  vulnerabilities of our nations beloved figures, however this movie shows  Washington to be flawed and tired at times like the rest of his army  was.
The uniforms,locations, and camp life were accurate as well as the  filth and harsh existence the Continental Army had to go through.  The  movie did an excellent job of trying to film the famous battle, which  definitely caught the Hessians by suprise.
Overall, a well acted,  accurately portrayed Revolutionary War movie."
5528,767803310,5,"Powerful movie that conveys hope, love, and dedication.  Makes you think about what life is all about; what is really important."
5529,767803310,5,Great buy and fast shipping!!!!
5530,767803310,5,"Simple summary: conflict is bloody and horrible. Ironically enough, the ones who suffer the most are the ones that try to avoid conflict and live their lives. Occurs in some nameless Central American country. Good to great performances all around.

This movie presents the journey of one Dr. Cifuentes. Dr. Cifuentes is a very professional, knowledgeable  and respected medical practitioner. He recognizes that he is entering the nadir of his career. His wife has recently died and his kids are all grown up and living lives of their own. Time has given Dr. Cifuentes the opportunity to answer some nagging questions. Questions that he wants answered before he passes away. He wants to discover the value, or measure, of his life; his career, his teachings. What legacy has he left? What will he leave behind that's of any value? Now it's time for him to find the truth and the truth is not what he had ever expected.

I loved this movie. I watch it at least twice a year. Sayles is a great director and this is an under appreciated movie. 5/5 stars."
5531,767803310,3,"this film has not the promised subtitles. I saw it years ago with german subtitles and it was an impressive experience, but only with a few lines every 2-4 minutes you cannot follow the movie, only if you are a spanish speaker. I can understand a little spanish, but not enough to relax, and in Austria the understanding of spanish is not that great that you can watch the film with friends."
5532,767803310,5,"As the Peruvian's review indicates, there are certainly Latin Americans who don't want to face part of their political reality, just as there are US citizens who like to deny or rationalize the violence of the United States of North America.  The ""Indian Wars"" of the US empire continue as this film on the oppression of Guatemalan Mayan Indians reveals.  While President Clinton did offer a near-apology for our decades of funding and organizing Guatemala's dirty war that killed 200,000 people, our corporatocracy continues to exploit the region and to wage economic warfare via NAFTA, CAFTA and the World Bank.

""Men With Guns"" beautifully shows all who care the sort of brutal madness that has been taking place in Central America.  I've shared this film with Guatemalan immigrants I know, and they confirm the suffering they endured at the hands of our proxy forces.  These US taxpayer funded troops wiped out Guatemalan villages in the same way the Nazis wiped out Russian villages.  It's such a disgrace that it happened, and that so few Americans know about it.  This film offers us a tool to raise awareness, and civic groups like Global Exchange and Madre offer us opportunities to act in solidarity with the victims of US foreign policy.

I'd also recommend books by Nobel Peace Prize-winner Rigoberta Menchu (who, predictably, had a Yale professor conduct a campaign to cast doubt on her credibility - a standard psy-op tactic of our military establishment) and the DVD documentary, ""When the Mountains Tremble.""

Also see ""Guatemala: Never Again!"", the official report of the human rights office of the archdiocese of Guatemala.  Sadly, Bishop Juan Girardi was murdered a couple days after turning in that report."
5533,767803310,1,"Entusiasmado por los comentarios previos decid adquirir esta pelcula. Que decepcin. Lenta,aburrida con una adaptacin de guin a mi criterio mal estructurada. La direccin de actores,psima,pese a tener a Luppi y a Damin Alcazar que es el nico que se salva en su corta actuacin.

Pens que tendra algo que ver con ""La Ley de Herodes"",extraordinaria pelcula de Luis Estrada,pero absolutamente nada que ver.

Recomendable slo para tus enemigos."
5534,767803310,4,"When a civl war rages through a country, the line between the good guys and the bad ones is blurred.  Such is the case in Men with Guns.  Both sides in conflict abuse others, even the innocent ones, to secure their goals."
5535,767803310,5,"The basis of the movie was taken from a secondary character in Francisco Goldman's book ""The Long Night of White Chickens"", which is about Guatemala during the civil war, also the cover photo is the work of a Guatemalan photographer, Palma. Excellent movie."
5536,767803310,4,"Federico Luppi, the fine actor from Argentina, takes the lead role as Dr. Fuentes.  He sets out to find his former students on the road to places he's never been. The shift in his life is caused by the death of his wife. He sets out in spite of his family not wanting him to leave. The aging doctor first encounters one his former students, now a drug dealer, using the same drugs he taught him to cure others, he is now using them for ill purposes. His journey has only begun and he finds many more dissapointments along the way. This is a beautiful film that is allegorical, historical, contemporary  and packed with messages for the viewer to interpret. In his quest to find his students he finds his country to be quite different from the view he had of it prior to his leaving the city. He encounters missing people  and tales of abductions from men with guns. The villagers call them white men with guns but are quick to say that the Indios are also now white men. Although the story takes place in an unnamed country, the parallels to Guatemala are clear. Having witnessed a corpse on the roadside while travelling in a bus (everyone gawked with little concern, as though it were a common sight) in Guatemala and seeing the treatment first hand of the military I am pretty sure this is where it is. However, this is unimportant as these occurences of hit squads and paramilitary goons, in cahoots with the military, are a frequent sight in many Latin American countries. Anyway, Dr. Fuentes picks up several people along the way to expand the tale. He picks up a ""liberation priest"" who abandons his collar and those who believed in him, a former military thug turned thief, an indigenous young woman who doesn't speak since she was raped by soldiers and a street-savy kid who is an orphan and Dr. Fuentes's guide. All represent the society Dr. Fuentes is unaware of and  as they tell their sordid stories, amidst flashbacks  and surreal dreams, a country whose people live in brutal chaos is revealed . This is a powerful movie, one to be seen more than once in order to fully enjoy. Although the story evolves around Dr. Fuentes and his crew,  there are several encounters with a funny couple who are ""informed"" tourists with bad Spanish accents  and worse pronunciation. A completly enthralling film, in spite of its length, that hits close to the harsh reality of life in Latin America. A beautiful film  that is set to the backdrops of the jungle and it's  relics from the past, as well as present day village life , it is a movie that is visually breathtaking and mentally stimulating. Recommended for those that like movies that carry a political and social commentary. Great stuff, see it before your next vacation to the tropics, so that as the guy from the radio says""and now you know the rest of the story"" before you get there."
5537,767803310,5,"The main charachter is approaching his retirement. As for his last vacation, he decides to check up on his students. Students that he trained to help the poorer people of his country. However, he soon discovers that something is wrong. His students are missing, and the only explanation he can gather about them is that somehow ""Men with Guns"" were involved. What starts as a vacation soon turns into a quest. Soon more charachters join him, including an orphan boy, an awol solidier, an ex-priest (my favorite) and a mute woman. All of which leads to the ending. No hollywood fairytales here. Just a solid story, and a solid cast. Part thriller, part drama, this is a truly great film."
5538,767803310,5,"This is a great film.  Don't be deceived by the title, it is not a violent film, though it is about violence.
There seems to be a debate here about where the movie takes place, whether Mexico, Guatamala, or somewhere in South America.  According to John Sayles, the answer is all of the above.  Though it was filmed in Mexico, Sayles purposely set it in an unnamed country to illustrate that, at least in one sense, the various conflicts in latin american countries are essentially the same--one group of ""men with guns"" supposily is fighting with another group of ""men with guns,"" but really all both groups are doing is terrorizing the local people who live there.  To the villagers, it doesn't matter which group is the government and which are the rebels, or which ideology each group claims to be fighting for.  This general point could apply equally to many countries in latin america who have had rebel movements over the past 20 years (this includes Guatamala, but also Columbia, Peru, El Salvador, and unfortunately several others).  While people familiar with Central America will recognize that the villagers wear Mayan dress, that is more due to where the movie was filmed than an intent to set it in a particular country.  The soundtrack is comprised of music from almost every latin american country, from Argentina to Mexico, and Sayles says in the liner notes that he did this to emphasize that the film is not about any particular place, but rather what those conflicts have in common and why they remain so intractable."
5539,767803310,5,"Ok, after reading all the reviews, I feel a bit of an obligation to correct some of the entries, especially since the ""most helpful"" one is blatantly wrong on this respect.  The movie, it is generally agreed, takes place in Guatemala.  this is not specified, though, but it is evident throughout the movie that this is where it is happening.  So don't believe that it was in south america, or mexico, or anything like that (though it was filmed in Mexico).  How many mayans are there in South America?  So I hope that this entry helps.  And its not my opinion, but the opinion of my college professor.
Oh yeah, and its an AWESOME movie."
5540,767803310,5,"This movie is obviously about Guatemala. The opening sequence shows a Mayan woman and her child in traditional dress. However bad things got in Mexico, they were not as bad as this. The events described and particular horror of the place closely follow the counter insurgency campaign in the Guatemalan highlands where the guerrillas were largely  annihilated as a military force. However the oppression of the Indians continues and the underlying political issues were never resolved, hence the feeling at the end of being left hanging. The film pulls the viewer into the abiguity and heartbreak  of a situation where the Indians were caught between both sides and paid the price.
It is a unique film and one has to respect Sayles' courage and insight in making it, and choosing to do so in Spanish.
Unfortunately that assured that much the audience in the US would not see it but Sayles has never seemed to worry much about commercial success."
5541,767803310,5,"This movie grapples with some serious issues.  What, exactly is going on politically in South America?  Where does individual responsibility lie? What does helping people really mean?  What kind of legacy is it possible to leave?  The setting of this movie is an unnamed country in South America. The writer/director, John Sayles, did this on purpose.  This is to show that the kind of thing depicted in the movie could happen anywhere.  However, it was shot in Mexico, in Spanish, with English subtitles.
The movie starts Federico Luppi as Dr. Humberto Fuentes, a wealthy doctor who is approaching retirement and has never paid close attention to the realities of his country.  His greatest achievement, the ""legacy"" he is leaving, is his participation in an international health program in which he trained young doctors to work in the poorest of villages.
I watched this movie with horror and then, finally, resignation, as Dr. Fuentes travels in the mountains and makes startling discoveries.  I made a few startling discoveries myself -- the abject poverty of the people, the disregard for human life, the acceptance by the people of this as a way of life.  He finds that the people have no food.  He finds that both the army and the guerillas are equally brutal.  The movie takes us all on a journey with Dr. Fuentes.  Along the way we meet a homeless child, a priest who lives with his own private demons, and a deserter from the army with a history of participating in the carnage.  The movie goes deeper and deeper into the despair and devastation.
This is not a comfortable video to watch as it brings the viewer not only into the realities of the political systems in South America, but to the basic question of individual responsibility.  I recommend it for those who are willing to take a fresh look at these things.  You will not be smilling after viewing this video.  But you will be thinking."
5542,767803310,5,"This is a wonderful movie.  A beautiful story is interwoven with complex  ideas about religion, death, politics, and ""might makes right""  philosophy.
I just want to point out that contrary to what a few  reviewers said, this movie clearly did not take place in Mexico.  Doctor  Fuentes specifically says, in one scene, that Mexico is North of where they  are.  What country it takes place in is not possible to determine, and this  seems deliberate to me."
5543,767803310,5,"Those at a certain station in life will identify strongly with Dr. Fuentes, the main character in John Sayles' deeply insightful ""Men with Guns."" Aware that he's facing a terminal illness, Fuentes seeks  to leave behind a legacy in the way in which he trains others to use their  own gifts. He realizes this is the most effective way to pass on the  knowledge and awareness that he's achieved during his life.
That's why  I'm not comfortable when other reviewers have said he's ""naive.""  Yes, he's uninformed about his country's politics, perhaps intentionally  so. But he's also the only character in the film who treats all others with  respect and is able to interact with them all. And, without giving anything  away, note that Fuentes succeeds.
This is a deeply thoughtful, almost  spiritual film, and I have great respect for John Sayles for writing,  directing, and producing it."
5544,767803310,5,"This movie is truly fantastic. The story is somewhat depressing but it also leaves a feeling of hope. It's dramatic, suspenseful, funny and sad but wholly engrossing.
The cinematography is wonderful. The writing,  casting, acting, locations and music are all superb. Even though the film  contains many 'flashback' sequences those parts are easily distinguished  from the 'present'.
Also, don't let the fact that it's (mostly) subtitled  put you off - you probably won't realise you're reading, after a  while!
Altogether, a wonderful film that would be enjoyed by anyone -  whether living close to Latin America or half a world away."
5545,767803310,5,"this movie was great.  i loved it.  a lot of people have never seen it, but you should."
5546,767803434,5,"I saw this movie with my new wife the night before we flew to Egypt on the first stage of our honeymoon, and I am grateful to her for letting me watch it! It is superb. Oh, I wish Bill Clinton was more like Mr. Ford's fictional Pres! Definitely a movie to watch before flying, if you're up to it. The action scenes, production, special effects, musical soundtrack by the stalwart and excellent Jerry Goldsmith and the photography are first rate. The story is a bit silly, I mean this couldn't happen in real life, Russian renegades invading AF1 posing as reporters, but what the hell, it's just a movie!  END"
5547,767803434,5,"When I saw ""Air Force One"" in the theater, I remember distinctly the movie gripping hold of me (when the plane was taken over) and not letting go until the very end.  While not as intense the second time around, ""Air Force One"" on DVD doesn't disappoint.  There are plenty of points in the movie that left me squirming in my seat.  The movie isn't perfect as a movie: the opening scene is way too violent (and glorified at the same time) and towards the end, where the VP rips up the paper authorizing her to take power (I liked it but most people probably don't think on such a symbolic level), the movie fizzles a bit.  But as far as being entertaining, ""Air Force One"" is by far the very best.  END"
5548,767803434,4,"Absolutely one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  Especially when the 747 drives through the ramp and parking area, skidding around corners, making 'vroom vroom' noises.  Hilarious.  END"
5549,767803434,5,Excellent thanks!!!!
5550,767803434,5,Good oldie!
5551,767803434,5,"Arrived on time and in great shape. Good action, intense at times. Love it."
5552,767803434,5,great
5553,767803434,5,I think this film is interesting.
5554,767803434,5,I watched this movie when it was up for renting and I se
5555,767803434,5,Can Harrison run for president now? Please?
5556,767803434,5,I'm former military so I love this movie.
5557,767803434,5,Thanks--Terrific movies.
5558,767803434,1,"Disappointing, to say the least.  Unfortunately the filmmakers have chosen to turn President Ford into some sort of cinematic action hero when the opportunity was there to do a thorough examination of his mishandling of Watergate.  Shame, shame..."
5559,767803434,5,Excellent.
5560,767803434,5,Loved it
5561,767803434,5,"I love this movie, just had to have it."
5562,767803434,5,"Outstanding acting by Harrison Ford, great to see him in his glory days"
5563,767803434,5,"Having fun watching these ""old"" movies.  Harrison Ford really does well with this one!"
5564,767803434,5,just what i wanted
5565,767803434,5,Great movie
5566,767803434,5,Great Movie
5567,767803434,5,Not smart to piss off people in positions of power
5568,767803434,4,Cleveland in the Opening scene is fantastic
5569,767803434,5,Used--Works as advertised!
5570,767803434,5,"It's difficult to take seriously any film in which the President of the United States manages to lay waste to a whole bunch of hijackers without so much as loosening his tie, but then again Petersen's movie is so full of such inconsistencies that you go along with it in spite of itself. Ford is the Pres, the only man who can save his titular planeload of cronies - plus, of course, his wife and daughter - from the sneering Oldman and his terrorist buddies. A very silly picture, but an ultimately thrilling one; taken as a big dumb slice of popcorn entertainment it more than delivers the goods."
5571,767803434,5,Good Movie
5572,767803434,5,Love the action from biginin to end
5573,767803434,5,Just what I wanted and it arrived on-time!
5574,767803434,5,Excellent. Love this movie
5575,767803434,5,"Great movie, came as expected. A+ seller"
5576,767803434,5,Upgrading from VHS.
5577,767803434,5,Awesome patriotic movie!!!!
5578,767803434,5,"Have watched it 6 times, will probably watch it many more times.  Love it!!"
5579,767803434,5,A classice
5580,767803434,5,I enjoy the movie and am replacing bus tapes.
5581,767803434,5,I love this film. I wish America would have a President like this!
5582,767803434,5,"I have this same movie on ""SuperBit DVD"" with DTS , and i know this blu-ray audio is recorded in Dolby True and it should look better but i want to hear which one will sound better or more dynamic..?"
5583,767803434,5,great movie
5584,767803434,5,"What we'd all like to see...the president of the US of A going mano a mano with terrorists.

When Air Force One is infiltrated and overtaken by terrorists, the persident is hustleld into his escape pod and sent on his way...or so everyone thinks. Instead, he gets out and the pod flies empty while the commander-in-chief uses the skills that won him the Medal of Honor to outwit those holding his staff and family hostage.

It's best not to think too strongly about the feasibility of the plot or the action but simply sit back and enjoy the violence, action, and heroics.  There's plenty of violence of both the good and bad kind as most of the  Secret Service is picked off one by one, some of the staff get killed and a couple throw themselves in front of bullets meant for the President.  There's a bit of quibbling going on as the people back in Washington argue over who's now in charge, some wanting to shoot the plane out of the sky, others wanting to wait and see before acting.

With an allstar cast, from Harrison Ford, Glenn Close as the Vice Prfesident who shows a little more levelheadedness than some of the other staff members, Xander Berkeley, Gary Coleman, Paul Guilfoyle, and William H. Macy, this is a well-acted, well-plotted movie which will leave the audience breathless. Fox TV called it a ""wild ride,"" and it's that in more ways than one, especially the plane-to-plane rescue scene. The special effects are great.

This DVD is owned by the reviewer and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review."
5585,767803434,5,Replacing my VHS tapes and had to order this one. Love it.
5586,767803434,5,"Love it every time, suspenseful without scaring me"
5587,767803434,5,favorite movie
5588,767803434,1,No extras what a rip off!
5589,767803434,4,Loke
5590,767803434,5,"Excellent movie with a great mix of action, adventure, and skilled acting."
5591,767803434,5,"Always like Harrison Ford, great action flick"
5592,767803434,5,Great movie and it looks great on Blu-ray a classic 90's movie
5593,767803434,5,This is a great action film about Harrison Ford who plays a president of the United States. Who kept a terrorist held in prison. And Gary Oldman who plays a hijacker and his people that he's with. And kidnaps everyone on board Air Force One. To give the demands to negotiate and have the prisoner released. This comes with commentary. I may recommend this to family and friends who may want to see this film.
5594,767803434,5,I could watch this movie over and over again... wait a second - I HAVE !!
5595,767803434,5,Ok
5596,767803434,5,Harrison Ford at his best in one fast-paced thrill ride !
5597,767803434,5,thriller
5598,767803434,5,Replaced both titles on DVD!
5599,767803434,4,Good entertaining movie. Harrison Ford is not disappointing in this action movie.
5600,767803434,5,I really liked this movie. It has a great story line.
5601,767803434,5,Another classic Harrison Ford movie!! Great movie!
5602,767803434,5,Nice addition
5603,767803434,3,This is a good action movie.  Terrorists highjack the Presidents plane with the President still on it.  He is a former marine and fights back.  HarrisonFord iis excellent as always.  Gary Oldman as the head villain is as well.  If you like action movies you will like this.
5604,767803434,5,best movie ever
5605,767803434,5,Great movie. You will cheer for America by the end. Colin Kaepernick has probably never seen it.
5606,767803434,5,"Love, love, love this movie!!"
5607,767803434,5,"GREAT MOVIE, one of Harrison Ford's best.  It also came promptly!"
5608,767803434,5,Excellent Movie - Very good acting - Believable.
5609,767803434,4,"Old but a classic worth watching.  This movie was made in the days when the plot was thinner and the violence was less gruesome (there's still plenty of killing).  I thought the acting was above average all around and Harrison Ford's was his usual excellent.  A good movie when you want some action with a little plot, but aren't in the mood to see heads getting chopped off and blood  spurting everywhere."
5610,767803434,5,Best Harrison Ford Film Ever!!
5611,767803434,5,Outstanding movie. My Mom and I love this movie.
5612,767803434,5,Great movie!
5613,767803434,5,"I received a Air Force One DVD two days ago. the DVD and its package are good like new one.
I am satisfied.
Thank you."
5614,767803434,5,Loved it!
5615,767803434,5,"This is one of my favorite movies!!!!  Excellent plot, excellent acting !!!"
5616,767803434,5,Another favorite great movie and wanted a dvd of it!
5617,767803434,5,Entertaining action film.
5618,767803434,4,One of those films you can watch over and over again.
5619,767803434,4,I love this movie
5620,767803434,5,Hey wonderful classic that I just replaced my DVD with a Blu-ray... Should have it in your collection...
5621,767803434,5,"This is a hold on to your seat action packed movie! If you have not seen it, I highly recommend buying this DVD. You might want to watch it many times over the years."
5622,767803434,5,Outstanding every time I see it.
5623,767803434,5,I like the action packed movie
5624,767803434,5,"Entertaining movie, intense, glad I was on the ground."
5625,767803434,5,"This is a must own film for any action fan.  Great tension throughout.  Although some scenes are pretty unrealistic, it makes up for it in terms of pure entertainment and action.  This is one of the few movies I have watched more than once, let alone twice.  I probably watch it at lest once a year.  The only negative I would say is that extras are severely lacking on the Bluray.  But it is still ABSOLUTELY worth owning, you will not regret it!"
5626,767803434,5,Harrison Ford portrays a president we all wish we had....one who is fearless and does the right thing.  Great action.
5627,767803434,5,very good
5628,767803434,5,Great entertainment!
5629,767803434,5,Good
5630,767803434,3,"If you believe that people can fire hundreds of bullets from automatic weapons in the pressurized cabin of a 747 jetliner and not have any problem with, say, dying from hypoxia; if you believe that dealing with terrorists is as simple as saying: ""We won't let you get away with this"" when civilians are kidnapped and/or killed (right: they won't get away with it because they wore explosive vests);  if you think that people can sneak around in Air Force One by sticking their heads around a corner and then ducking back out of sight AFTER the bad guy looks your way--and that this works for avoiding bullets, also; THEN THIS IS THE FILM FOR YOU!  Comic book patriotism and combat!  And Harrison Ford pulls out all stops and uses both of his expressions.  Doesn't get any better than this."
5631,767803434,4,Harrison Ford as President? You can't beat it.....Great movie
5632,767803434,5,Always wanted this one on dvd thanks great.
5633,767803434,5,"My husband & I both like this movie, so I bought this to replace our VHS format."
5634,767803434,5,This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time! President James Marshall is one of Harrison Ford's best characters!
5635,767803434,5,Great acting - exciting but predictable plot. Great action movie overall.
5636,767803434,5,We needed a replacement to our old DVD and if I can buy on Amazon Video we will.  Picture is crystal clear
5637,767803434,5,One of my all time favorites.
5638,767803434,5,Terrific!  A must see!
5639,767803434,3,"Very good action, but stretches the willing suspension of disbelief to the breaking point in my opinion. The idea that all those trained secret service agents could fire so many bullets in such close quarters and not even stop one hijacker is pretty unlikely. The agents were not very good at taking cover either.  Plus, even though it is just a movie, seeing all those guys get shot in the takeover scene is hard to watch."
5640,767803434,4,great movie. get off my plane
5641,767803434,5,Fantastic movie
5642,767803434,4,Fun action movie with Ford as a believable President with a couple of slightly unbelievable scenes.  Great adventure and suspense.
5643,767803434,1,sent back very disappointed dvd was wrong area wouldnt play
5644,767803434,5,"awesome movie, wonderful price. arrived on time!"
5645,767803434,4,Some unnecessary bad language. Great plot and ending.
5646,767803434,5,Harrison Ford is the man
5647,767803434,5,"Great flick,even after watching it for the fifth time."
5648,767803434,5,great
5649,767803434,5,I love it
5650,767803434,5,A classic. Great for President's Day or any other time of the year.
5651,767803434,5,"Air Force One (1997) is a relentlessly paced thriller that is still very pertinent to the dilemmas faced (or depending on one's point of view, not faced) by present American leadership in a hostile and ambivalent world.  Though the underlying scenario is a bit outdated (ala 1990s), the themes are still engaging.  Harrison Ford turns in a nuanced and very skilled performance.  He is backed by several other strong actors, including a rather young Glenn Close acting as Vice President.  Liesel Matthews is remarkable as a 12 year old ""first daughter"" and Wendy Crewson is believable as First Lady.

Plotting of the movie isn't perfect.  There are a few loose ends, but I won't spoil viewers' experience by discussing them at length.  Suffice it to say, there are some rather implausible acts by peripheral characters.  But overall, the story holds up well.

As a footnote, I would also add that I cannot imagine any US Presidential candidate in the current group of right wing crazies, panderers and political hacks, taking the public stand that Harrison Ford does as the President in this story.  His ""Be Afraid"" speech and the reasons behind it (""because it's the right thing to do"") are long overdue from the leadership of our country."
5652,767803434,4,Good movie.  I like the series.
5653,767803434,4,I enjoyed watching this movie.
5654,767803434,5,"Intense, well directed, and great acting!"
5655,767803434,5,Great movie!
5656,767803434,5,A classic! Totally awesome
5657,767803434,5,Great movie!
5658,767803434,5,Another intriguing movie starring Harrison Ford.
5659,767803434,5,great movie
5660,767803434,5,GREAT MOVIE!!!
5661,767803434,4,A very solid movie with a great antagonist. Gary Oldman always....always delivers. Harrison Ford as the president... Well if only right? All around a great cast. Good show.
5662,767803434,5,Great!
5663,767803434,5,Best movie.
5664,767803434,4,One of Harrison Ford's better movies!!
5665,767803434,4,Great flick!!!
5666,767803434,5,5 Stars does not do this movie justice
5667,767803434,5,Love this movie! Action packed all the way. Suspenseful and thrilling!
5668,767803434,5,Great action flick!
5669,767803434,5,great movie and picture
5670,767803434,5,good movie
5671,767803434,5,One of my favorite movies.
5672,767803434,5,Who wouldn't love it?  Drama - intrigue - and Harrison Ford!
5673,767803434,3,"The Movie itself is great.  However, the audio on my Blu Ray copy is off.  In the first twenty minutes of the film the voices do not match mouths. through out the entire film all the dialogue is very quiet almost drowned out by the sound track and effects.  I hope the copy you get is perfect.  It is  a quite enjoyable movie."
5674,767803434,5,For a movie that came out in 1997 I was expecting the video quality to be grainy but the streaming quality was actually in HD! The movie is very suspenseful and I was sitting at the edge of my seat the whole time I was watching. Can not go wrong with this Harrison Ford movie and it is good enough to watch again!
5675,767803434,4,good action and suspense
5676,767803434,5,"This movie is an awesome movie.  The only drawback is that you have to keep adjusting the volume while streaming.  In the action parts it is extremely loud, but in normal scenes it is very low."
5677,767803434,5,get off my plane
5678,767803434,5,Excellent!
5679,767803434,5,Excellent!

5684,767803434,5,Just a good movie worth every minute
5685,767803434,4,"Love all the dramatic tension! Some of the scenes were, however, just a bit too graphic for me. A very patriotic film with strong performances by the women!"
5686,767803434,4,Great action flick
5687,767803434,4,love it.
5688,767803434,5,Ford is great

5690,767803434,4,"Classic suspense, action packed movie. Oldie but goodie"
5691,767803434,4,"Good action suspense movie.

Pure Harrison Ford!"
5692,767803434,5,"Great movie, interesting premise for a pre-9/11 world with a president who isn't  afraid to handle business and take action."
5693,767803434,5,it is a clasic
5694,767803434,5,great movie

5712,767803434,5,"Heart stopping every time. Introduced our 11 year old grandson to it. Definitely one of his favorite lines now is ""Get off my plane!"""
5713,767803434,5,Good show
5714,767803434,5,"Great, lots of action!"
5715,767803434,4,great!!!!!!!!!!!!

5719,767803434,5,Movie was amazing! Harrison Ford is always good
5720,767803434,5,Thriller and almost believable
5721,767803434,4,Always enjoy Harrison Ford
5722,767803434,4,Its a good time at the house with some popcorn.
5723,767803434,2,Good for something on in the background
5724,767803434,5,Interesting to see what Air Force one looks like.
5725,767803434,5,"Good old edge of the chair movie.  Harrison Ford, as always, is excellent."
5726,767803434,5,"An oldie but a goodie.  Harrison Ford at his best as a combat pilot turned President of the United States.  In a twist on your typical airplane disaster your hero has to save the day from terrorists but I hesitate to write any more least I give away too much of the very limited plot to this story.  If you like this one then I encourage you to check out Snakes on a Plane which represents in my opinion this genre at its very, very best and Samuel Jackson is not hard on the eyes either!"
5727,767803434,4,Classic Harrison Ford. I Think he though he was in a Star Wars Movie.
5728,767803434,5,I really enjoy this movie.
5729,767803434,4,One of many great Harrison Ford movies.
5730,767803434,3,"A good movie with great performances by the lead actors.  Brought down a bit by the incredible stupidity of the terrorists (luring them around the plane by making noise seems to be the favorite method of dispatching them, followed closely by them simply walking everywhere by themselves into conveniently empty rooms), the movie is nevertheless an exciting and enjoyable action movie."
5731,767803434,1,bad connection or something
5732,767803434,4,Love it
5733,767803434,5,Fantastic movie action

5735,767803434,5,Energetic excitement
5736,767803434,3,Well-made silly movie... It doesn't quite hold up as it used to. Harrison Ford's last hurrah as a lead actor who can hold a movie together.
5737,767803434,5,Great movie
5738,767803434,5,Harrison Ford fan for life! Movie is great!

5763,767803434,3,is a good movie and plenty of action.  I always enjoy Harrison Ford movies.
5764,767803434,5,Dope movie
5765,767803434,5,Awesome movie!! One of my all time favorite..
5766,767803434,4,"Classic Harrison Ford (which to me has always sounded like a car dealership), Great job by Gary Oldman, Dean Stocwell, especially Glenn Close."
5767,767803434,5,Classic 90's action movie.  Harrison Ford turns in another great performance.
5768,767803434,5,Good movie
5769,767803434,5,Riveting
5770,767803434,5,Great movie
5771,767803434,5,"Great movie when made and great movie now.  Stellar performance by all, especially Harrison Ford."
5772,767803434,5,"This movie now seems dated, it is now 18 years old. The first 747 was used as ""Air Force One"" in 1990. When this movie came out ""Air Force One"" had been a 747 for only 7 years. Now it has been 25 years since ""Air Force One"" has been a 747.  In 2023 the new Aircraft that will serve as Air Force One will be a 747-8.  When the last 747 was delivered it was based on a 747-200 at the time it was delivered the 747-400 was being delivered. The 747-8 has the same type rating as the 747-400 they both have no flight engineer. The new Aircraft being used for Air Force One may be modified to have a flight engineers position, because it will undoubtedly have many more systems than a regular 747-8.  It will essentially have a type rating unto itself and its twin(s).  That is, no 747-8 rated pilot would be qualified to fly Air Force One.  Piloting Air Force One is a prestigious job, although it is boring. There are Air Force pilots that don't want the job. Many former Air Force pilots won't work for the Air Lines for the same reason.  It's like being a Formula One Car driver and then getting a job driving a Trailways Bus."
5773,767803434,5,Great movie
5774,767803434,3,Olde but goodie
5775,767803434,4,still relevant with intense shoot-out after all these years!  Good Friday night fun!
5776,767803434,5,This is just a fantastic movie. I've seen it many times and always love it.
5777,767803434,5,It was as good the second time as it was the first.
5778,767803434,5,This is the best movie i have ever seen!
5779,767803434,2,"Sound quality due the age of movie, is really bad! Couldn't hear them talk very well, then it would get really loud in action scenes."
5780,767803434,5,Awesome movie
5781,767803434,4,Great acting by main characters and supporting actors
5782,767803434,2,"I was not able to was watch movie at all.  the picture keep freezing every two or three, I just finally gave up trying to get the movie to play.  I gave it stars because I know Harrison Ford is a good actor."
5783,767803434,4,Good movie
5784,767803434,5,Truly one of the best of Harrison Ford's non Lucasfilms works. Riveting from start to finish!
5785,767803434,5,I have seen this movie hundred times... Yes i will watch it again...
5786,767803434,5,"I loved this movie. It was dramatic, exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat. It sure did get hairy when they were at the back of the plane when the tail door was opened. I don't know what it is called, so I'll call it a tail door. Any movie Harrison Ford is in is okay with me. I think he is a great actor."
5787,767803434,5,"I have always enjoyed Air Force One, it's combination of action and drama is on par with many of Ford's works."
5788,767803434,5,Great movie
5789,767803434,5,Indiana Jones on a plane. What more could you ask for?
5790,767803434,5,Great movie!!
5791,767803434,5,Love this movie!
5792,767803434,5,Love it
5793,767803434,5,Good movie all the way thru. We really like this one.
5794,767803434,4,A very good movie and was delivered on time.
5795,767803434,5,Great comedy!
5796,767803434,4,My second time watching this one. Just as good as the first time.
5797,767803434,4,This one is a popcorn-chewer of the first order!  Terrific performances by Harrison Ford and the always astounding Gary Oldman head an excellent cast in this wonderful nail-biting trip on the President's plane!  The blu-ray is a fine program release.
5798,767803434,5,Have the VHS version.  VHS machine broke.  Enjoyed this movie so much just had to have it on Blu-ray to watch anytime we elected.
5799,767803434,5,Great DVD
5800,767803434,5,"Air Force One kept me on the edge of my seat for two hours, and the only time I found wishing it would be over sooner was when the tension was getting to be more intense than I wanted to deal with.  Nevertheless, when the hero is Harrison Ford and the bad guys are communist mobsters, I'll stick with it until the end!

With outstanding performances from all cast members, a serious story line, seamless special effects, and top-notch production values across the board, this film delivers the goods for fans of heroic action adventures.  I watched in Blu-ray with Dolby stereo; and the video and sound were state-of-art excellent."
5801,767803434,5,This one had been a challenge to find....
5802,767803434,5,"Great movie. Great suspense. Harrison Ford is superb. And Gary Oldman plays a great bad guy, though my favorite character of his is still Sirius Black."
5803,767803434,5,Kept me on the edge of my seat every minute.  Captivating.
5804,767803434,3,LOVE THE MOVIE BUT CASE WAS BROKEN & PIECES WERE SHAKING AROUND IN BOX
5805,767803434,5,"Great movie, one of Harrison's best!"
5806,767803434,4,"High intensity, action packed and of course, the good guys always win.

The only thing I had an issue with was the talking was quite but the action was very loud...as if I was in a surround sound theater.  I turned on the caption and it was just fine."
5807,767803434,5,Nice
5808,767803434,5,Love movie
5809,767803434,5,Love this movie
5810,767803434,5,Now that's what a U.S. President should be like!!!
5811,767803434,5,love it
5812,767803434,5,I'm Getting the Tape And Watched
5813,767803434,5,Love this movie so much and so much better in 4K
5814,767803434,5,"One of Harrison Ford's best! And I guarantee you'll find any excuse to say ""Get off my plane"" after you see it!"
5815,767803434,4,Great movie!
5816,767803434,5,"First of all, in my mind Harrison Ford can do no wrong. This is a great action film for the entire family. A definite classic! I got this product as a gift for my husband's father and it came exactly as expected. I would definitely recommend this movie and obviously, nothing is better than Blu-ray. =)"
5817,767803434,5,Updating my video library from VHS to DVD.  Great price and quick ship!
5818,767803434,3,"Die Hard on Air Force One with the President of the United States as John McClane?  This one has easily one of the most ludicrous high concepts of any high concept action movie from the past 30 years.  When it played in theaters I hated it--and I'm a huge fan of action pictures, although not of star Harrison Ford.  At that time I would have given Air Force One a one star review.

In light of the fact that the screenplay was by Andrew W Marlowe, the creator of Castle I decided to give the movie another shot and I have a slightly different take on it now.  Given the cheeky tone of his television show, which takes nothing, least of all murder seriously, I'm inclined to think that the script for Air Force One was written as a tongue-in-cheek commentary on dumb Hollywood action pictures rather than an actual dumb Hollywood action picture.

The problem is that native German director Wolfgang Peterson (Das Boot, The Perfect Storm) while tremendously talented is not known for his sense of humor or light touch.  He has an uncommonly good eye for widescreen visuals and old-style you-can-clearly-see-everything-that's-happening approach to his action scenes but he directs Air Force One with way too much gravity, making whatever humor that manages to survive seem campy and unintentional.  It's hard to ultimately made the action set-pieces in Air Force One exciting given Wolfgang Peterson's approach since it's simply not possible to take any of them as seriously as he apparently does.

I'm not suggesting that Air Force One should have been directed as a comedy but there's a lighter approach in the films of fellow countryman Roland Emmerich (Independence Day; 2012; White House Down) that would have been perfect here.  Emmerich knows how to direct ridiculous material in a way that allows it to be silly and fun but still exciting--he knows he's making silly pulp films and embraces the humor of the ridiculous cliffhangers while allowing the audience to laugh without guilt and still enjoy the action and suspense.

For a practical example of what I'm talking about assume you are in the mood for a disaster movie--would you rather watch Wolfgang Peterson's technically well-made and lavish but dull Poseidon or Roland Emmerick's deliriously ludicrous but exciting and funny 2012?  The choice is obvious for me--but I was also a big fan of Emmerich's White House Down which I couldn't even get any of my friends to even watch, so what do I know?"
5819,767803434,4,Good action movie from the 90s. I liked it. Harrison Ford was great. The rest of the cast is full of big names and they do a nice job as well in their limited roles. There's not a ton of character development. It's an action movie so that's ok by me.  I meant to see it almost 20 years ago now but I'm using amazon instant video to catch up on all of the action movies that I meant to see along time ago but didn't. With the instant video I don't have to spend the money on buying a blu ray and waiting for it to get here. Glad I finally say this movie and I plan to watch about 20 more movies like this one in the near future.
5820,767803434,4,Great Movie!
5821,767803434,5,Great movie!
5822,767803434,5,loved
5823,767803434,4,Good movie.
5824,767803434,5,"I watch this one over and over, great acting and great performers.  Gotta love Harrison Ford"
5825,767803434,5,"Its Harrison Ford, as President, telling the bad guys ""get off my plane"". Love this awesome movie.  A classic."
5826,767803434,4,Classic Harrison Ford
5827,767803434,5,I love this movie. I think it is one of his best movies
5828,767803434,5,Love it one of Harrison fords best movies especially when he tells the hi jacker get off my plane I love I watch it all the time thanks
5829,767803434,5,Great movie. Great blu-ray.
5830,767803434,5,iLOVE IT.
5831,767803434,5,Great movie
5832,767803434,5,Great!
5833,767803434,4,add on to my library :)
5834,767803434,5,GET OFF MY PLANE! I wait for that line. Such a fun movie.
5835,767803434,5,"Air Force One is one of my most ""re-watched"" movies."
5836,767803434,5,Great movie - special effects at end lacking...
5837,767803434,5,I've seen the movie.  It's a classic I wished to keep.
5838,767803434,5,"Two Wolfgang Petersen directed films together in one package is all you could want, with fine picture quality and all the extras from the old DVDs.

""Air Force One"" in particular is excellent."
5839,767803434,5,I like the movie good
5840,767803434,5,"Kept the viewer on the edge of their seat!  Some scenes were somewhat unrealistic, but overall, very good movie!"
5841,767803434,3,This could have been a 4 star movie but there are parts that are just pathetic and they are relatively frequent.
5842,767803434,3,Wasn't the terrorist a famous actor too? Worth watching !
5843,767803434,1,I never enjoyed this movie.
5844,767803434,5,Harrison Ford do you really need to know any more. great cast also.
5845,767803434,4,Nail biting suspense
5846,767803434,4,Classic!
5847,767803434,5,Good quality and good move. Glad to see it on Blu-Ray. The story is a bit of a stretch but fun none the less.
5848,767803434,5,Great action movie
5849,767803434,5,Love the movie
5850,767803434,3,Entertaining because Harrison Ford is in it. Not great.
5851,767803434,4,"Good action movie, I think a older Harrison Ford could have pulled this one off a little better, Gary Oldman was a very good choice as the bad guy!"
5852,767803434,5,Good story. Excellent action and suspense. Always like Harrison Ford
5853,767803434,2,"Indiana Jones Meets Captain America.
Harrison Ford is, well, Harrison Ford as the superhero president who somehow finds he and his family hijacked on Air Force One.
At least this president, refreshingly, knows his way around weapons and would be great in an ad for the NRA.
Gary Oldman as the arch villain,  once again, proves he is the quintessential character actor, making any role, no matter how badly written, his own."
5854,767803434,5,I love this movie.  Lots of action with an actual plot.
5855,767803434,4,This is a typical Harrison Ford completely over the top action flick. If you like this type of move you will enjoy this one as I did. If you prefer movies with some semblance of reality then this may not be for you
5856,767803434,4,"Harrison Ford is a favorite of mine, I enjoy his movies overall. This one is intense action."
5857,767803434,4,"Good Harrison Ford Flick.  Dated, but fun to watch."
5858,767803434,4,very nice movie
5859,767803434,5,Great action
5860,767803434,5,Great
5861,767803434,5,My wife had to leave the room during the scary scenes.
5862,767803434,4,"Good Suspense Thriller but implausible. That plane was simply marvelous and I wished I could travel in it. The actors' lines were very corny and the ending of the script was predictable. I've seen the movie a few times but decided to watch again because I wanted to make sure I watched something that would be enjoyable and didn't require a lot of thought and energy to watch. I was tired from a long week and this movie provided good entertainment. By the way, if you've been in the military at all there will be some scenes that will either bother you or crack you up."
5863,767803434,4,"President is tough and knows his way around his jet.
Great movie."
5864,767803434,3,Pretty sure my husband liked this more than I did and would give it 4 stars.  It is a good movie with an exciting finish but has a pretty high body count.  Terrorist are not my idea of entertainment.
5865,767803434,2,"Again- There were so many times during this movie that my jaw just dropped at the stupidity.
The typical argument in defense of a film like this is, ""Of course it's stupid. It's an action movie."" Yes: even the good action movies tend to be stupid. This one, though, is stupid but has nothing to recommend it. The patriotism is simplistic, insipid, and insulting. The plot is trash, the characters trash, the action trash. The movie doesn't even make sense within its own reality - suspension of disbelief fails you.
What an awful, awful film. This is the kind of movie that makes me look suspiciously at anyone who thought it was good. I wish there were a no-star option."
5866,767803434,5,Perfect
5867,767803434,5,one of the best suspenseful dvd's ever produced! Harrison Ford nails this with outstanding character and emotion!
5868,767803434,5,"Harrison Ford at his best!  If you like an action movie filled with terrifying terrorist, paramilitary President of the United States--and hair-raising stunts that leave you clinging to the edge of your seat---than this film is right up your alley. Very entertaining."
5869,767803434,5,Love it
5870,767803434,5,Great movie!
5871,767803434,5,Great
5872,767803434,5,Great movie!
5873,767803434,5,Very good movie.
5874,767803434,4,I've watched this movie several times over the years. I enjoy it every time.
5875,767803434,4,"Harrison Ford, as always, amazing!"
5876,767803434,5,Great movie
5877,767803434,5,Great movie! Non stop action. It keeps you on the edge of your seat with suspense. The Russian boss had such a thick Russian accent that even though he was speaking English he should of had subtitles for just him never less it didn't take away from the awesomeness of the movie. Highly recommended to any Harrison ford and action movie lover
5878,767803434,4,Pretty much a nail baited.
5879,767803434,5,Awesome movie!
5880,767803434,5,Love this movie. If only this was a real president...
5881,767803434,5,One of Harrison Ford's best.
5882,767803434,4,Good movie
5883,767803434,5,Great movie
5884,767803434,5,nice
5885,767803434,5,This movie was great. Suspenseful and lots of action.
5886,767803434,5,One of our favorites
5887,767803434,5,Good print. Good movie...
5888,767803434,5,Gripping!
5889,767803434,5,Great movie
5890,767803434,3,"This movie was pretty cool, but unrealistic."
5891,767803434,5,"Oh, to have such a man as our commander-in-chief!  But also, to have people who are willing to sacrifice their all to insure the continuity of our nation's constitutional ""mind.""  It was a terrific, barn-burner of an action adventure film!"
5892,767803434,5,Awesome movie
5893,767803434,5,Great action flick!
5894,767803434,4,"I really like this movie. A movie with Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman. What a combination!!!
It is unusual because so much of it takes place on the plane but it works."
5895,767803434,4,"Fun, action packed movie"
5896,767803434,5,One of my favorite movies.  Always love watching this. It's one you can watch over and over again and it never gets old.
5897,767803434,5,I watched this movie after Harrison Ford's recent close call.  He has remained a bigger than life character both on and off the screen.  I've watched this movie several times since it was released.  It is probably the most heroic role that Ford has played.  Fun to watch again and again.
5898,767803434,3,Was a good Harrison Ford action movie.
5899,767803434,5,Very good Show
5900,767803434,5,"Good Entertainment. I've probably watched this movie 4 or 5 times since it came out in the late 90's. If you are an intense critic of technicalities and plausibility you may not care for it. But if you are a Harrison Ford fan and want to watch an entertaining action flick from yesteryear, its a good watch."
5901,767803434,4,good old movie
5902,767803434,5,Good to see the movie again since years ago!  One of the best Harrison Ford  movies!
5903,767803434,5,A great movie.  Wish we had a president like that now!
5904,767803434,5,Great movie and a great cast
5905,767803434,3,"An enjoyable, if not too substantial, action thriller with Harrison Ford playing a mashup of every possible positive attribute anyone could want in a President and Gary Oldman taking a villainous turn. I like Goldman's work as a whole, and he doesn't disappoint here, either. While Ford's character isn't all that believable, it's not the actor's fault - the script just doesn't ascend to the actor's capabilities.
I like the premise of the hijacking of Air Force One, and watching the bad guys' execution of their plan was cool, but the plot starts a long spiral of improbability from there. I'm glad I watched, but I won't be seeking it out again for a while."
5906,767803434,5,Ok
5907,767803434,4,It was a decent movie.
5908,767803434,3,"This movie is of the kind that used to be known as a ""star vehicle"" back in Hollywood's Golden Age. Harrison Ford is such a likable movie star, and one that audiences can always put their faith in. It's as if his sole reason for getting up in the morning is to entertain, and this he has been doing like no one else for 40 years.

""Air Force One"" (1997) is just a classic action adventure movie. Ford is the President, flying from Moscow aboard the presidential airplane back to Washington, along with his family and many staffers. The plane has not been in the air long when Gary Oldman, (excellent as always), pops up as the leader of a gang of Russian terrorists who hijack the plane, hellbent on having the President release a hostage who is a general and folk hero. Of course, the US does not negotiate with terrorists -- or does it?

The Oldman-led terrorists are vicious, but not brilliant. They completely lose track of the president, and he manages to escape into the belly of the plane. His family and staff don't know where he is, either. He manages to use his cell phone to call the White House -- whether that would work or not, I don't know. In any case, he and everyone in the Situation Room devise a plan to neutralize the bad guys and rescue the good guys. It may be far-fetched, yet clichd, predictable stuff, but a good cast, entertaining story and pretty good dialogue make it seem less so.

Ford mutters to himself better than any actor, and he gets to do a good bit of that while he's below decks. He is always a step ahead of the terrorists, and he and Oldman face off well. There are some nice little twists and turns.

Don't expect a tremendous amount from ""Air Force One."" and it won't disappoint. The most startling difference in movies like this made in the late 1990s and those made in the mid-2010s is in the special effects. CGI has completely changed the look of movies, and allows for much greater suspension of disbelief. The action sequences in ""Air Force One"" would have benefited from the now-ubiquitous process, but you can't work with what you don't have."
5909,767803434,5,Great movie
5910,767803434,4,Good movie.
5911,767803434,5,I love this movie. It's my all time favorite.
5912,767803434,5,A calssic
5913,767803434,5,"If you like action and you like the president, you'll like this. Therefore we should think about electing Harrison Ford president. Otherwise forget it. You must have a president than likes America as well as himself for a change or forget it. Would this movie work today?  I doubt it. So just use your imagination and enjoy the movie while you can."
5914,767803434,5,Excellent movie!
5915,767803434,2,"Short on plot; long on violence for its own sake. I was disappointed in the way it ended; never getting Harrison Ford on Terra Firma. The only memorable line, ""Get off my plane"" didn't warrant a rating higher than two stars, and wasn't enough to make it worth watching a third time (I watched it twice to see if I might have missed further enjoyment, but I didn't). They cast Wendy Crewson; one of Canada's greatest actresses as First Lady, and gave her nothing to do but cower in the corner acting timid. And Glenn Close as Vice President was a commendable choice; if only she hadn't bowed to all the men, even the discussion over the 25th Amendment lacked the anticipation one might expect in the given situation. This film was cast w/ some of the greatest talents; its just too bad they were let down by what I feel was so weak a script."
5916,767803434,3,Not bad Not Great
5917,767803434,4,"Harrison Ford knows how to protect an airplane, but I wish he would not fly his personal planes over homes. Although I'm impressed with how well he recovered from a mechanical failure of his plane on a golf course and wish him good health in the future."
5918,767803434,5,"A edge of your seat ride, even when it has been seen several times. It's that good."
5919,767803434,5,:)
5920,767803434,5,Great
5921,767803434,5,Awesome show
5922,767803434,4,"What isn't to love about a quintessential 90's political action flick with Harrison Ford?  No qualms here, and surprisingly few plot holes for such a 'silly' movie.

I enjoy watching it every few years.  Amazon quality was great, as expected."
5923,767803434,5,Classic ford
5924,767803434,5,Full of action and a great movie for Harrison Ford fans
5925,767803434,5,Great product!
5926,767803434,5,Been looking for this movie forever and found it on Amazon.  Since I purchased it I have watched it twice.
5927,767803434,5,This is a highly entertaining fast-paced action movie. So what if it is not totally realistic. It is entertainment. Great performance from Gary Oldman as the villain. James Marshall is probably the best movie president ever!
5928,767803434,5,Great movie I can't wait to  watch it again.
5929,767803434,5,"This was a typical movie that would come out in the mid 90s of a terrorist taking over a commercial aircraft, the hero saves the day kind of thing.  What was awesome about this movie is the fact terrorists took over Air Force One with the President still on it, but ironically with the President being a maverick ex-air force pilot himself takes it into his own hands to defeat the terrorists.  The good guy wins.  And of course it was awesome because the president was Harrison Ford"
5930,767803434,5,I only buy first class movies.  This is one of them.
5931,767803434,5,This is one of the best movies I have seen!  Harrison Ford is the greatest  in this movie!  Edge of your seat !!!
5932,767803434,5,I've seen this a couple times or so  just a great movie
5933,767803434,4,Very exciting but too much at the end of the movie.
5934,767803434,5,great movie ford at his best
5935,767803434,5,Good
5936,767803434,5,:)
5937,767803434,5,Great action
5938,767803434,3,Good Movie but rather dated.  The acting was very good and it is a great lesson in how our world has changed in the years since this movie was made.  I wonder how much more tech. the new Air Force One is compared to the one in this movie.
5939,767803434,5,Great movie
5940,767803434,5,"This is one outstanding set! 2 wonderful actors, Harrison Ford and Clint Eastwood. If you don't own these movies in Blu-ray format, what are you waiting for?! The picture and sound are just great. Widescreen glory here. Sony has done an awesome job with the discs on either side in package. I love both these actors and am proud to have these in my Blu-ray library and you will, too!
IN THE LINE OF FIRE ~ Clint Eastwood is a Secret Service Agent assigned to protect the President. One deranged man (John Malcovich) is determined to bring down the President at any cost. Renee Russo plays a witty agent and co-worker alongside Clint. (It's one of his best movies.)
AIR FORCE ONE ~ Harrison Ford plays the US President that vows he will not negotiate with terrorists. The President's plane is (somehow) hijacked, (a task that would be impossible), and with time running out he must decide on family or the Country.
Highly recommended!!"
5941,767803434,5,Great movie hands down

5943,767803434,5,"OK, I'll say it.  If Harrison Ford ran for president I would vote for him.  This movie is packed with suspense, thriller and action with just enough sentiment to make it a straight up action flick."
5944,767803434,5,Outstanding!
5945,767803434,5,"I love this movie, especially how Harrison Ford goes through the whole movie wearing a suit and tie lol"

5952,767803434,5,Harrison Ford plays a great Indiana Jones and Han Solo as president in an adventure/thriller that harkens back to a pre-9/11 America. Great action and story and could fit right in with the Jack Ryan series!  No digital special effects in this movie!
